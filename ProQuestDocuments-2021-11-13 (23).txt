Texto completo: The governors of multiple states ordered all restaurants and bars to close due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.
Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced on Sunday he would be issuing an order for the closures, set to begin at 9 p.m., as more than 35 cases of the coronavirus have been reported in the state, where schools, sporting events, and other large gatherings have been shuttered for the foreseeable future.
"Based upon all of this and based upon the fact of where we are at this point, in this pandemic — we are literally at a crucial, crucial, crucial stage — Dr. Acton will be signing an order that all bars in the state and all restaurants will close at 9 o’clock tonight,” DeWine said. “Carry-out food is still allowed and certainly encouraged."

Soon after, Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he was ordering the state's bars and restaurants to close starting on Monday through March 30.
"I tried earlier this week to appeal to everyone's good judgment to stay home, to avoid bars, not to congregate in crowds. It's unfortunate that many people didn't take that seriously. The time for persuasion and public appeals is over. The time for action is here. This is not a joke. No one is immune to this, and you have an obligation to act in the best interests of all the people in this state," he said.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom followed suit, ordering closed all bars, nightclubs, pubs, and wineries in his state, and said restaurants should reduce their occupancies by half. He also told people over the age of 65, who are at high risk, to isolate themselves at home.
At least 2,800 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus as of Sunday morning, and 59 people have died, according to the New York Times.
President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday.

Texto completo: The Islamic State is telling members not to travel to Europe to carry out attacks as the coronavirus ravages the continent.
After years of telling adherents to wage jihad in European countries, the terrorist group issued a set of “sharia directives” in its al Naba newsletter telling attackers to “stay away from the land of the epidemic.”
ISIS also said terrorists should wash their hands regularly and “cover their mouths when yawning and sneezing.” The newsletter describes the COVID-19 virus as a “plague” and a “torment sent by God on whomsoever He wills.”
“Illnesses do not strike by themselves but by the command and decree of God,” the directive read. ISIS also told followers who are already in Europe to stay put and not travel back to the Middle East.
The “healthy should not enter the land of the epidemic and the afflicted should not exit from it,” it said.
There are already more than 100 cases of the coronavirus in Iraq. In Syria, which once composed the bulk of ISIS’s territorial caliphate, dictator Bashar Assad said there are no cases, although that claim has been disputed. One Syrian doctor said the virus has reached the country, but the government forced him to recant the statement after the doctor was arrested by the regime.
Syria’s closest ally, Iran, has been one of the worst-hit countries. The Iranian regime claims there have been at least 12,729 cases and 611 deaths, although academics have said that number is not realistic. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, a dissident group working to overthrow the regime, said on Saturday that more than 4,000 people in 166 cities have died as a result of the outbreak.
The World Health Organization recently declared the outbreak a pandemic.
As of Sunday morning, at least 2,759 people have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, and 59 people have died from the pandemic in the United States, according to the New York Times. Worldwide, there are 155,000 cases and almost 6,000 deaths.

What Bernie Sanders’ allies want to hear at tonight’s debate

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the onetime Democratic presidential front-runner who notched victories in several early states, is now facing long odds. It’s not impossible — though it is statistically unlikely — for him to reverse the course of the primary and mount a comeback against former Vice President Joe Biden.
To regain a delegate lead or, failing that, to make the maximum impact on the race for the views he cares about most, he needs to use Sunday’s presidential debate stage to great effect, amplifying the distinctive message of his campaign and tailoring it to this moment of the coronavirus crisis.
Progressive allies and grassroots organizations helped make Sanders a leading contender in the primary, and have pinned their hopes of systemic far-left change on his candidacy’s success.
Here’s what several prominent voices with these groups are looking for from Sanders on Sunday. Most agree that he should push Biden on the issues that the Sanders coalition prioritizes, but not come off as too oppositional.
— Rebecca Katz, progressive consultant in New York City
Katz, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, said Sanders had little path to the nomination but should still push aggressively for the issues he champions.
Bernie Sanders has a chance to make sure Joe Biden is ready to lead. And that means ready to lead progressives and the country in this moment. And it’s Bernie Sanders’ duty, if Biden is the nominee, to make sure he can go one on one with Trump. For Bernie Sanders, it has always been about the issues. So I think you’re going to see him lay out his core beliefs and what we need to do. And if Joe Biden is smart, he will pick up some of those issues and carry them into a possible administration. Just because Dems don’t think an issue isn’t important enough to bring up in a primary, doesn’t mean it won’t define the general election. Don’t leave issues on the table for Trump to pick up.
— Ryan Greenwood, director of movement politics for People’s Action
Greenwood’s group, a grassroots organization that endorsed Sanders in December, emphasized how the current crisis revealed the serious vulnerabilities of the working class, a subject that Sanders has made central in the 2020 campaign.
The coronavirus pandemic means that almost everyone in the country is now feeling the crisis and instability faced by the multiracial working class on a daily basis. The question is, as Sanders has said, “Joe, what are you gonna do?” The choice is pretty simple: On one hand we have a platform where nothing fundamentally changes, in which we leave millions of people out of the solutions when crisis hits. On the other hand, we have a platform in which no one gets left behind, everyone’s well-being is protected, and everyone can pursue their full potential. We look forward to Sanders highlighting that contrast.
— Evan Weber, political director of the Sunrise Movement
The Sunrise Movement, a group of young activists that has been instrumental in pushing the Green New Deal, endorsed Sanders in January. Weber emphasized that the Vermont senator still enjoyed a huge advantage among young voters, and that Biden must recognize that he needs to win over young people to win.
With questions of electability clearly shaping voters’ decisions in this election, Sen. Sanders needs to use this debate as an opportunity to show Democratic voters why he’s the best candidate to take on Trump. Luckily, the senator has a clear case to make: No Democrat can win in November without the support and enthusiasm of young people, and millennials and Generation Z are swinging in wide margins for Bernie because he is championing a platform that meets the scale of our generation’s challenges.
— Ana María Archila, co-executive director at the Center for Popular Democracy Action
Archila’s group, which supports Sanders, represents a number of smaller organizations that work with community groups on issues including immigration, health care and housing.
The coronavirus pandemic has exposed how fragile we all are when millions of people are uninsured, and when workers cannot afford to take a day off from work because they risk falling back on their bills. On Sunday, we hope to hear Sen. Sanders not only make the case for these policies in the context of the current crisis, but also force Biden to commit clearly to the agenda that has mobilized young people. Throughout his campaign, Bernie has asked people to fight for someone they don’t know. We hope he will use this debate to remind people that we must take care of one another, and use our democracy to build a society where we all can thrive.
— Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party
The Working Families Party initially endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the fall, but moved to support Sanders after Warren left the race.
This fragile moment has vindicated Sanders’ fundamental critique of American capitalism. We’re far more dependent on each other than we’ve been led to believe, and our failure to invest in public goods — especially public health — has made us vulnerable. If Sanders can connect his bold solutions to our current crisis, he can win the night, and maybe more.

Sarah Ruhl: The theaters are closed. Write a poem instead.

Texto completo: The theater community is reeling from Thursday’s announcement of a shutdown of Broadway theaters through April 12, a public health measure to protect audiences from possible coronavirus transmission. A blow to the heart — and to a vital economic engine of the city — it’s also a fairly unprecedented move, but for two days following the Sept. 11 attacks.
At this moment is it comforting, or not comforting, to think back to the bubonic plague sweeping through London in the early 1590s, and again, catastrophically, in 1603? Then, too, the authorities closed the theaters in order to stem the tide of infection.
The theater, I have always maintained, is composed of language, ether and actor. One commodity the theater has that film and television do not have is air. Air is that wonderful substance that denotes presence. It creates that magical backstage dust we inhale together. It is also the substance through which people cough, sneeze and infect one another.
Though theater artists are now understandably worried about the loss of livelihood for friends and colleagues, there is probably also a collective sigh of relief that our leadership put health over profit. The virus disproportionately affects the demographic over the age of 70; and theater audiences tend to skew older.
How can we be responsible to our audiences, and also go about our business, which involves bodies in proximity to one another? Though playwrights have always dreaded coughing patrons (it generally means we have induced boredom), now the cough is greeted with a different kind of dread. At the moment, most forward-thinking businesses are telling workers to work from home, to cancel all but essential travel and to have meetings by video.
But what if your business is presence?
During the 1590s plague, when the theaters were shut, William Shakespeare apparently chose to write poems instead. From his “Venus and Adonis,” penned while the playhouses were closed and writers were essentially quarantined, came this somewhat strange compliment: “The plague is banished by thy breath.” Should we theater people — writers, players and audiences alike — be staying home now and writing and reading poetry as a curative for the next month? Books, unlike group events, carry no germs.
My own children’s school has closed indefinitely, and I’ve been encouraging them to learn a new poetic form every day they are at home. So far, only my son has written a sonnet, an ode to candy. The final couplet: “Now I must eat you with a splendid grace/Remember how I put you in my solemn face.” But they all just looked at me with raised eyebrows when I mentioned a villanelle.
Thomas Dekker, a not very well-known Elizabethan playwright eclipsed by the competition, wrote an account of the plague year called “The Wonderfull Yeare, 1603” in which a seventh of London’s population died, despite shuttered theaters and quarantines. Dekker writes of the desolation and loneliness of that year, as well as of the triumphant reopening of the theaters, like “a merry epilogue to a dull play.”
“This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle; wonderful, inscrutable, magical and more, to whosoever will think of it,” he said.
Our theaters need to remain nimble to this public health crisis, and all the calm and extraordinary artistic directors I know are doing just that. Many theaters are, as my fellow playwright Lauren Gunderson has suggested, modifying cancellation and rebooking policies for the month of March in the hopes that sick audience members return to the theater when the crisis has calmed. The Women’s Project Theatre has canceled its performances and closed its office, but is guaranteeing payment to its artists for the duration of the closure.
Some artists and theaters, like the nonprofit Court Theatre in Chicago, have called for audiences who can afford an extra ticket or two to donate canceled tickets back to nonprofit theaters, knowing that the livelihoods of their favorite artists might swing in the balance.
The theater has survived a plague before, not only in the 1600s, but also in the 1980s. And the theater, with its tender heroism, empathy and propensity to help others, will survive again.
As we wait out the reopening of our theaters this spring, we might try amateur theatricals at home, living room readings, podcasts of theater and staying home and writing plays in solitude. In the meantime, I am taking up the mantle of everyone’s worried great-aunt and telling my students at the Yale School of Drama not to kiss on the cheek, not to gather in large groups and, when in doubt, to stay home and write or read love poems. And on April 13, only 10 days before Shakespeare’s birthday, to return to the theater — where we are reminded, in joy and in tragedy, of how interconnected we all are.

Timothy Egan: Trump should just stop talking about coronavirus

Texto completo: For the good of the nation, for the health of the country, in the interest of doing something drastic to mitigate a national disgrace, President Donald Trump should self-quarantine.
I’m serious. Every time he opens his mouth or makes an appearance, he puts the American people more at risk. His three years of flagrant and unremitting lying have made him the last person who should be the source of life and death information for 330 million Americans.
Trump should be isolated for his own health as well. He may have been exposed to a Brazilian official who tested positive for the coronavirus and was at Mar-a-Lago with the president just a few days ago.
Nothing reveals character like a crisis. Trump’s prime-time address to the nation on Wednesday was a full-blown disaster, blaming Europe, congratulating himself, fanning confusion and panic. Even reading a script from a teleprompter, this executive could not deliver a truthful, coherent message to a jittery nation.
Wall Street panicked. White House aides were quick to issue clarifications and corrections. No, the president did not intend to declare economic war on the world’s largest trading bloc, in Europe. No, insurance companies would not suspend co-pays for coronavirus “treatment” — only testing.
Another thing about a crisis: The only asset you have is your credibility, as the late Paul Volcker liked to say. Trump has zero.
Since the coronavirus outbreak, Trump and his senior aides have been deliberately misinforming the public — 28 falsehoods or dubious claims, by CNN’s count. The president said cases were “going very substantially down,” when they were growing exponentially. He said anyone who wanted a virus test could get one, when there were massive shortages. He said, “This is a flu,” though COVID-19 has a fatality rate 10 times greater than the flu.
Trump disbanded the pandemic response unit — Shout it out, folks — and he previously slashed funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He reportedly overruled his own health officials who wanted to warn the vulnerable about flying. In the early days of the outbreak, his administration missed a chance to ensure more widespread testing. Many lives could have been saved.
On Monday, he said: “Nothing is shut down. Life and the economy go on.” Those are the words of a b.s. artist trying to gaslight his way through a pandemic.
No one close to Trump has the guts to say what needs to be said: Stop talking! Now. Don’t utter another word. Put your phone away. Go to Mar-a-Lago and play golf, which is to say, resume your normal schedule. He can have his Big Macs brought to him, as always. He just has to go dark.
Let Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who has just the right mix of bedside manner reassurance and give-it-to-me-straight gravitas, do the daily briefings. Let Vice President Mike Pence handle the logistics. Let Congress finish up with a package that will offer free testing and give financial relief to the most vulnerable. And allow career government servants — the deep state pros who will keep this listing ship of state from sinking over the next months — to do their jobs.
Trump looked at the sun during an eclipse and nothing happened to him, so maybe he feels invulnerable. But he also will never accept any responsibility for months of government inaction. As the writer David Frum said, “The rooster who took credit for the sunrise is outraged to be blamed for the sunset.”
In addition to credibility, a leader needs to express empathy. Trump is sociopathic on this front. In a visit to the hospital after the mass shooting in El Paso last year, he was incapable of showing simple human compassion to family members of victims; instead, he bragged about his crowd size from a previous rally.
He told the grieving widow of a slain American soldier that her husband “knew what he signed up for.” Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, the state hardest hit, “is a snake,” said the president.
In that bizarre appearance at the CDC a week ago, Trump wore a silly campaign hat, patted himself on the back, and spoke nonsense about his medical expertise. It was like showing up at a funeral in beach clothes and asking what time is happy hour.
And what to make of that picture your president retweeted of him fiddling, presumably while Rome burns, with a tag line: “My next piece is called … Nothing can stop what’s coming?” The man is sick in the head.
Given a chance to reach across the pond and offer condolences to longtime European allies in Wednesday’s Oval Office address, Trump said nothing positive and put up a travel wall. With one exception: He exempted the countries where three Trump-owned golf courses are located.
Tom Hanks, in just a few words revealing that he and his wife had tested positive for coronavirus, was the best American voice of the week.
Trump thinks he’s Churchill, the man of the hour. He’s Neville Chamberlain, the man who couldn’t see the world threat at this doorstep.

Texto completo: How did the political left squander the opportunity that was the 2020 primary campaign?
The Trump presidency has created tremendous energy among progressives. More than half of Democratic voters now identify as liberal. Most favor “Medicare for All.” A growing number are unhappy with American capitalism.
This year’s campaign offered the prospect of transformational change, with a Democratic nominee who was more liberal than any in more than a half-century. Instead, the nominee now seems likely to be a moderate white grandfather who first ran for president more than 30 years ago and whose campaign promises a return to normalcy.
True, Bernie Sanders could make a comeback, but it would need to be a big one. The race would have to change fundamentally for Sanders to win.
If he doesn’t, the obvious questions for progressives is what went wrong and how they can do better in the future. I think there are some clear answers — empirical answers that anybody, regardless of ideology, should be able to see. I’d encourage the next generation of progressive leaders to think about these issues with an open mind.
The biggest lesson is simply this: The American left doesn’t care enough about winning.
It’s an old problem, one that has long undermined left-wing movements in this country. They have often prioritized purity over victory. They wouldn’t necessarily put it these terms, but they have chosen to lose on their terms rather than win with compromise.
You can see this pattern today in the ways that many progressive activists misread public opinion. Their answer to almost every question of political strategy is to insist that Americans are a profoundly progressive people who haven’t yet been inspired to vote the way they think. The way to win, these progressives claim, is to go left, always.
Immigration? Most Americans want more of it. Abortion? This is a pro-choice country. Fracking? People now understand its downsides. Strict gun control? Affirmative action? A wealth tax? Free college? Medicare for All? Widely available marijuana? Americans want it all, activists claim.
This belief helps explain why so many 2020 candidates hoping to win the progressive vote — including Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris — embraced ideas like a ban on fracking and the decriminalization of the border. The left persuaded itself that those policies were both morally righteous and politically savvy. To reject any one of them was to risk being labeled a neoliberal sellout.
The thing is, progressive activists are right about public opinion on some of these issues. Most Americans do favor higher taxes on the rich, marijuana legalization and additional gun control. But too many progressives aren’t doing an honest analysis of the politics. They are instead committing what journalist Matthew Yglesias has called “the pundit fallacy.” They are conflating their own opinions with smart political advice. They are choosing to believe what they want to believe.
They often do so by pointing to polls with favorably worded, intricate questions — and by ignoring evidence to the contrary. Affirmative action, for example, typically loses ballot initiatives. Polls show that most Americans favor some abortion restrictions and oppose the elimination of private health insurance.
By designing campaign strategies for the America they want, rather than the one that exists, progressives have done a favor to their political opponents. They have refused to make tactical retreats, which is why they keep losing.
I think Warren may have been the person most damaged by this dynamic in 2020. (And, yes, she was also hurt by sexism.) She could have positioned herself as the candidate who excited much of the left but was more acceptable to the center-left than Sanders. Instead, she mimicked Sanders, making many Democratic voters who were rooting for her worried that, like him, she couldn’t win a general election.
Or look back at the 2018 midterms. In competitive districts, candidates backed by progressive groups like Justice Democrats and Our Revolution were shut out. They lost in either the primaries or the general election. There isn’t a single Sanders-like member of Congress from a purple or red district. There are dozens of moderates.
Remember: The policy positions of Sanders, Warren and other progressives — on Medicare for All, for instance — are often closer to the views of most Democratic voters than the moderate position is. Yet many Democrats spurn the progressive candidate. These voters care more about winning than about perfect policy agreement, and they support the candidate whom they (correctly) see as more in tune with the full electorate.
The progressive wing of the party has still had a good few years, pushing the party left in multiple ways. Even Biden’s platform is strikingly liberal. But if progressives aren’t satisfied being influential runners-up, I would suggest three broad principles.
First, don’t become PINOs (progressives in name only). Decide on a few core ways in which you think moderate Democrats are wrong, and stake out different positions.
Second, stop believing your own spin. Analyze public opinion objectively. Acknowledge when a progressive position brings electoral costs.
Finally, start testing some new political strategies. A single break with orthodoxy can send a larger signal. It can make a candidate look flexible, open-minded, less partisan and more respectful of people with different views.
Maybe the new approach should involve economic progressivism and cultural moderation, which happens to reflect American public opinion. Maybe it involves a different approach on immigration — insisting on a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally but also a slowdown of future immigration. Maybe it means announcing that fracking and nuclear energy are crucial to fighting climate change. Or maybe it involves finding more progressive candidates who hunt or talk about their relationship with Jesus Christ and have some related policy positions.
I realize that political compromise usually feels unpleasant. But I’d ask: How does losing feel?
As luck would have it, the Democratic Party has a loyal group of voters who, though hardly monolithic, tend to be more pragmatic and less wishful than progressive activists. They also tend to be culturally moderate, as many swing voters are.
This group, of course, is black voters, especially those middle-aged and older. They just swung the 2020 nomination away from Sanders and toward Biden. Until progressives figure out how to do better with black voters, they are going to have a hard time winning. And the same strategies that will help progressives win more black voters in the primaries are also likely to win over more swing voters in a general election.

Texto completo: Let us pray, now, for science. Pray for empiricism and for epidemiology and for vaccines. Pray for peer review and controlled double-blinds. For flu shots, herd immunity and washing your hands. Pray for reason, rigor and expertise. Pray for the precautionary principle. Pray for the National Institutes of Heath and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pray for the World Health Organization.
And pray not just for science, but for scientists, too, as well as their colleagues in the application of science — the tireless health care workers, the whistleblowing first responders, the rumpled, righteous public servants whose long-ignored warnings we will learn about only when the 12-part coronavirus docu-disaster series drops on Netflix. Wish them all well in the fights ahead. Their weapons, the weapons of science, are all we have left — perhaps the only true weapons our kind has ever marshaled against encroaching oblivion.
It may sound paradoxical to plead for divine sanction of scientific pursuit. But these are dicey times for science and for scientists, and they need all the help they can get. As the coronavirus spreads, it is exposing the fraying seams of our overextended world. In societies as different as China and the United States, those seams are starting to look similar. The failures to contain the outbreak and to understand the scale and scope of its threat stem from an underinvestment in and an under-appreciation of basic science.
Sure, this is not exactly breaking news; decades of global environmental heedlessness paint a grim picture of modernity’s responsiveness to scientific foreboding.
But this novel coronavirus illustrates the problem more acutely. If it doesn’t kill us it should at least shake us out of the delusion that we can keep ignoring the science and scientists who are warning about the long-term dangers to our way of life. Religious texts say that societies face destruction when they forget God. The coronavirus, like the accelerating climate-related disaster, shows what we face when we decide to blind ourselves to science.
This is what happens when you ignore and silence front-line doctors who warn of impending disaster, as authorities in China did in the early days of the outbreak: a possible global epidemiological and economic catastrophe.
This is what happens when you gut the United States’ pandemic-response infrastructure, as Donald Trump has spent the last few years doing: a CDC that botches the most basic defense against disease — testing for it.
I wish these were one-off errors that we could attribute to authoritarian Chinese communism or routine Trumpian incompetence. But they point to an underlying global dysfunction, one that transcends political parties and styles of government.
Science has always faced threats. Its purpose is to shed light on truth, and there have always been those who would stifle the dangerous facts scientists unearth. But today the stakes are higher. How we’ll fight the gravest threats humanity faces will depend on how governments and citizens understand and interpret the findings and cautions of science.
And what we’ve seen so far in the global response to the virus should frighten you. Our inattention to science is sometimes laid to Americans’ supposed “scientific illiteracy,” but the truth is more complicated. If it’s true that a lot of Americans don’t know a lot about science, it’s because across American society, science is actively undermined, underfunded, ignored and suppressed.
On social networks and in too many corners of the mainstream media, scientific expertise is cloaked by a fog of propaganda, misinformation and scam ads for essential oils and that one mystery food every gut doctor in America is begging you to throw out. From the food industry to the drug industry to the oil and gas industry, corporate America routinely hides science under a haze of well-funded oppo. The gun industry did one better: Under legislation pushed for by the National Rifle Association, the federal government until recently was hamstrung in even funding scientific research into gun violence.
Our collective inability to communicate about science has thoroughly perverted our politics. Because science has become so deeply intertwined with partisan dogma, people’s very conception of scientific expertise has been hijacked by tribal reflex. Today, a lot of people seem to determine how much they trust scientists based on their political ideas, which is backward and bizarre.
What we’re left with is a society embarrassingly ignorant about the world around us. The vice president thinks smoking doesn’t kill, condoms are “very poor” protection against disease, and the best way to curb an HIV outbreak is through prayer. The president says global warming is a hoax and attempts at conservation are making American life too inconvenient.
It’s not just politicians. The number of Americans who say vaccines are important is declining — and anti-vax conspiracies cross partisan divides, finding fans among Northern California hippies and some corners of the GOP.
Hence my call for divine intervention. Science and scientists face crushing opposition. In addition to silent-spreading disease and a burning planet, they must take on the moneyed, the godly, the dictatorial and Mike Pence.
If we won’t support them and won’t listen to them, the least we can do is pray.

Refreshed, resilient, 'radically inclusive' Long Wharf Theatre announces its 2020-21 season

Texto completo: The Long Wharf Theatre will leave its mainstage shuttered for most of its 2020-21 season, not due to coronavirus but in service of artistic director Jacob Padrón's mandate that the New Haven theater be "artistically innovative, radically inclusive, and create meaningful connections."
Undeterred by a week of reactions and reschedulings by arts organizations around the state due to public health concerns, the Long Wharf went ahead with an announcement event at the theater Wednesday night.
The biggest revelation is that four of the five shows in the 2020-21 season will be held in the Long Wharf's Stage II space, which at 200 seats is half the size of the theater's mainstage.
In another bold stroke, every show in the season will be directed by a woman. The theater's new leadership team has been openly addressing the fact that the previous artistic director was removed after a host of "#metoo" complaints chronicled in a 2018 New York Times article. "Given where this company has been," Padrón says, "I felt 'Let's think about that, let's be transparent about that.' Let's celebrate our women. Who are the phenomenal women who may have been denied opportunities in the theater earlier?"
In yet another innovation, each of the productions in the Long Wharf's 2020-21 season will have designated "community partners." Managing director Kit Ingui says that allying with other local organizations allows for "different voices" and more diverse audiences to be part of the process.
The season
*"Torera" by Monet Hurst-Mendoza, about a female bullfighter. The show, which may feature puppets alongside human actors, is a partnership with Sol Project, a national theater initiative founded and run by Padrón that supports and promotes the work of Latinx theater creators.
*"Night's Dream," a reimagining of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" by director Shana Alexander that abridges Shakespeare's text and scales down the cast to eight actors.
*"The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity," a comic drama bu Kristoffer Diaz about a professional wrestler navigating the modern capitalist, religious and political world. The play was a Pulitzer Prize finalist a decade ago. The play is being co-produced with the small New Haven theater company Collective Consciousness Theatre, which specializes in contemporary African-American dramas.
*"Queen," Madhuri Shekar's political drama about the decline in the bee population. A Long Wharf press release says the play "remarkably interweaves ambition, friendship, ethics, STEM, ecological crises and agriculture's most reviled bogeyman, Monsanto, into a provocative portrayal of brilliant women confronting inconvenient truths." The show is being produced in partnership with the New York-based National Asian American Theatre Company, which will stage the play after Long Wharf does.
*"Jelly's Last Jam," a new version of the 1992 Broadway musical about jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton. It will be directed by Patricia McGregor, inspired by a production she did as a student at the Yale School of Drama in 2009. That Yale production was notable for reducing the amount of tap dancing in the show and upping the dramatic scenes. The community partner is more amorphous this time: New Haven's Dixwell neighborhood, which has a rich local tradition all its own. The theater hopes to hold events associated with "Jelly's Last Jam" in the Dixwell area.
Staging every show of the season except the large-cast musical "Jelly's Last Jam" in Stage II is partly due to a hope that the smaller stage can provide a more intimate theatergoing experience. But both Ingui and Padrón acknowledge that economics is also a factor. While the current season, which was already being set up when the new team was being put in place, "has been meeting some revenue goals," Ingui says, the Long Wharf's revenue and attendance numbers have been in a steady decline for years.
"The theater hasn't been financially stable for a while. We need to create a different business model that will be viable."
"With the challenges we are facing, we realized that we could no longer do business as usual," Padrón says. "I love the intimacy of Stage II. We go to the theater for community. We've seen performances with 40 or 50 percent capacity on our larger stage. In Stage II that would be 90 percent capacity. There's an impact, psychologically, to sitting in a full theater."
The new plan involves increasing audience comfort: Stage II will undergo a renovation, with new seats in the auditorium and an upgrade to the lobby. The Stage II stage will be used this season in its accustomed proscenium style, but that configuration could change in the future, Padrón says. "When I walk into Stage II, I don't see limitations. I only see possibilities."
"We're happy about the total picture this season provides," Ingui says. "There's celebration in all the shows, in their own way."
For Padrón, noting that a presidential election and other major world events will be occurring during the coming theater season, "this is the moment when the art we do comes to the forefront." In mid-September, shortly before the season begins, he will convene local arts leaders for a forum he calls "State of the Union: An Artistic Congress." He describes the event as "a collective call to action to rebuild our community.
"Theater has always had the power to wrestle with the big questions facing our country. There's a moral imperative right now. What is the responsibility of storytelling? What do we want to be? What do we stand for?"

Texto completo: It's inevitable: To contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and save thousands of lives, the economy is going to take a hit. As shutdowns disrupt businesses large and small, we may even fall into recession.
The Federal Reserve gets that we are at a critical moment, one on par with the 2008 financial crisis. On Sunday, the central bank cut its benchmark rate by a full percentage point to near zero — back where it sat for years during the Great Recession and beyond — and said it would purchase $700 billion in Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities.
The moves, which came less than two weeks after policy makers lowered rates by a half-point, are designed to help restore stability to stressed credit markets and ensure that banks have enough cash to lend, even as the world seems to fall apart. They won't send money directly to consumers or businesses.
The White House, by contrast, botched its initial response to the public health emergency, and the administration and Congress underwhelmed with their reaction to the looming economic crisis. As a New York Times editorial pointed out over the weekend, the bill passed by the House early Saturday to provide paid sick time and family leave for employees affected by the coronavirus has exemptions that limit its scope.
To be fair, the legislation, which President Trump supports, includes measures that would certainly help: free virus testing for those with no insurance, beefed-up unemployment benefits and food assistance, and more federal Medicaid funds.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was just a first step by Congress.
But unless she, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, and Trump can agree on a massive fiscal plan to cushion the coming blow, it's likely the stock market panic will metastasize into a full-blown economic crisis, despite the Fed's actions. While much of the financial aid may not be needed tomorrow, quick agreement would help restore confidence among consumers and businesses.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that he doesn't expect a recession, which is defined as two straight quarters of negative growth.
That's no surprise, given that his boss's reelection bid could be derailed if the economy tanks. But independent economists say a contraction isn't a foregone conclusion.
“Under the ideal scenario, the US economy or at least a huge part of it will shut down to slow the spread of the virus with the goal of allowing the health care system to cope. Then, in a few weeks, as the threat passes, schools, businesses, and life in general would re-open and get back to normal," Peter Ireland, an economics professor at Boston College, said in an e-mail. “Realistically, though, we can't count on everything working out that smoothly."
Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley, cautions that even with a relatively quick return to business as normal, the damage could be significant. In a March 13 paper, he said US gross domestic product could be cut by 6.5 percent on an annualized basis under a scenario in which economic activity is reduced by 50 percent for one month and 25 percent for a second.
"As a point of comparison, the decline in output growth in the US during the 2008-09 `Great Recession' was around 4.5%. We are about to witness a downturn that could dwarf the `Great Recession,' " he wrote.
Gourinchas's solution? Policies that would mitigate the economic losses, much like aggressive social distancing measures can reduce the stress on the health care system.
“It will require a massive program," he wrote on Twitter. “No tinkering at the margins will do."
With help from Gourinchas and others, here's what the feds should focus on.
1. People first. Workers need to get paid even if they can't get to their jobs because of lockdowns, they get sick, or they must stay home to take care of family members. The Pelosi package is an OK start, but more is needed to help people through this unprecedented situation.
“I'd love to find every Uber driver who is getting fewer rides or every coffee stand guy who is selling less coffee," said Megan Greene, an economist and senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center of Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.
But since that's not really feasible to be so targeted, she said, “I am in the camp that says just send checks. We've done it before. Other countries are doing it now."
Greene was referring to an idea proposed by Harvard economist Jason Furman in a Wall Street Journal op-ed column: a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult US citizen or taxpaying US resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria. The payments would be fairer and more efficient than cutting payroll taxes, an idea that Trump has floated, wrote Furman, who was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Barack Obama's second term.
2. Businesses second. During the 2008 financial crisis, corporations — most notably banks and automakers — got bailed out, while ordinary people lost their jobs and homes. That was a mistake, but it doesn't mean companies shouldn't get some help this time around. Otherwise, layoffs will surge as employees seek to reduce expenses and avoid bankruptcy.
The government is increasing the money available through Small Business Administration loans, but, again, it's not enough.
Greene suggests that the Federal Reserve be allowed to increase lending to small and medium-size businesses by offering cheap money to banks, with the loans guaranteed by the federal government. The European Central Bank has done this for years.
“The Fed can set up a similar program, though it has never been before," Greene said. “It only works if the government goes ahead and provides loan-loss guarantees."
Trump has suggested he would consider bailouts for the airlines and other industries directly impacted by the pandemic. Air carriers have been pounded by government travel restrictions, moratoriums on business travels, and consumers just staying home.
But where would industry bailouts end? Cruise lines and hotels are getting killed, too. But I worry more about smaller businesses, which have much fewer resources to survive until we get back to normal.
3. Don't forget the financial system. People have been saying this isn't a financial crisis. But it could become one if too many companies can't pay back their loans and banks respond to the losses by reducing lending. That explains why the Fed has taken emergency action between its regularly scheduled meetings.
“As banks begin to suspect that customers will be unable to repay loans on a timely basis this could cause banks to raise borrowing costs and to tighter financial conditions which could cause a spiral of slower growth," wrote Michael Klein and Miriam Wasserman in an analysis by EconoFact, a project of the Edward R. Murrow Center for a Digital World at the Fletcher School.
The Fed's monetary moves can do only so much, and its chairman, Jerome Powell, said it is likely the economy will contract for at least one quarter. Credit was cheap before the crisis emerged, and the central bank's lower rates will take months to work their way through the economy to consumers. US stock futures fell more than 4 percent when trading began at 6 p.m. on Sunday.
On the government-stimulus side, no package — no matter how expansive and well-designed — will be able to save every job and keep every company afloat. But Congress and the White House need to act nonetheless. Not to would be irresponsible and heartless.
How much will it all cost? More than $1 trillion, easily. Where will the money come from? Federal government borrowing. Now isn't the time to suddenly be worried about deficits.
“With interest rates so low, investors are almost begging the government to borrow," said Greene, the Kennedy School fellow.
Without aggressive action, the odds of a long and deep recession increase. If we do nothing, the costs —human and financial — will be far more staggering.

Texto completo: Two health care providers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston are infected with the coronavirus, and the hospital is contacting patients and staff who may have been exposed.
In a memo to staff Saturday, hospital leaders said they are in close contact with state and city public health officials and are following their guidance about how to proceed.
“As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, it is inevitable that health care workers will be infected, as is now the case at the Brigham," wrote Dr. Charles Morris, associate chief medical officer and incident commander. ''We are in the process of contacting patients and staff who may have been exposed.''
"While this news is unsettling, please be assured that our Brigham community has been preparing for this eventuality, and we will continue to take every precaution to protect our patients, their loved ones and our staff throughout this unprecedented pandemic,'' wrote Morris. The memo was also signed by Julia Sinclair, senior vice president of clinical services and incident commander.
Brigham spokesperson Erin McDonough said the providers did not work while symptomatic. She said the hospital can not identify or release details about the providers or their specific jobs because of privacy rules. Another person with knowledge of the situation said they are both doctors.
McDonough said in an email that the hospital undertook an “intensive tracing process" that involved a detailed review of every patient and employee the providers interacted with during a particular time period.
Staff who had close contact with either provider ― 15 minutes or more at a distance of less than 6 feet ― are quarantined at home for 14 days and undergo twice daily symptom monitoring, she said. Those with no close contact are allowed to work but must wear a mask and monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days.
Patients with close contact are monitored for symptoms. An environmental services team has been deployed to thoroughly clean the areas where the providers have spent time, McDonough said.
Doctors and nurses are at high risk for contracting the virus, especially if they treat patients who they do not know are infected.
At Berkshire Medical Center, where at least five patients have been hospitalized with the virus, about 70 nurses are quarantined at home after being exposed to those patients, according to the Massachusetts Nurses Association.
There was a gap of several days after the patients were admitted and before they tested positive for Covid-19, during which nurses were not wearing the highest level of protective equipment, hospital executives have said.
At New York-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., a lawyer from New Rochelle was admitted and had contact with dozens of health care workers before he was diagnosed with the virus. At least one staff member has tested positive for Covid-19 and many others were sent into quarantine, the New York Times reported.

Pandemics kill compassion, too

Texto completo: Some disasters, like hurricanes and earthquakes, can bring people together, but if history is any judge, pandemics generally drive them apart. These are crises in which social distancing is a virtue. Dread overwhelms the normal bonds of human affection.
In "The Decameron," Giovanni Boccaccio writes about what happened during the plague that hit Florence in 1348: "Tedious were it to recount how citizen avoided citizen, how among neighbors was scarce found any that shewed fellow-feeling for another, how kinfolk held aloof, and never met  nay, what is more, and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to abandon their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate."
In his book on the 1665 London epidemic, "A Journal of the Plague Year," Daniel Defoe reports, "This was a time when every one's private safety lay so near them they had no room to pity the distresses of others.  The danger of immediate death to ourselves, took away all bonds of love, all concern for one another."
Fear drives people in these moments, but so does shame, caused by the brutal things that have to be done to slow the spread of the disease. In all pandemics people are forced to make the decisions that doctors in Italy are now forced to make - withholding care from some of those who are suffering and leaving them to their fate.
In 17th-century Venice, health workers searched the city, identified plague victims and shipped them off to isolated "hospitals," where two-thirds of them died. In many cities over the centuries, municipal authorities locked whole families in their homes, sealed the premises and blocked any delivery of provisions or medical care.
Frank Snowden, the Yale historian who wrote "Epidemics and Society," argues that pandemics hold up a mirror to society and force us to ask basic questions: What is possible imminent death trying to tell us? Where is God in all this? What's our responsibility to one another?
Pandemics induce a feeling of enervating fatalism. People realize how little they control their lives. Anton Chekhov was a victim during a TB epidemic that traveled across Russia in the late 19th century. Snowden points out that the plays he wrote during his recovery are about people who feel trapped, waiting for events outside their control, unable to act, unable to decide.
Pandemics also hit the poor hardest and inflame class divisions.
Cholera struck Naples in 1884, especially the Lower City, where the poor lived. Rumors swept the neighborhood that city officials were deliberately spreading the disease. When highhanded public health workers poured into Lower City, the locals revolted, throwing furniture at them, hurling them down stairs.
The city thought the disease was passed on by people eating unripe or overripe fruit. The peasants responded by bringing baskets of fruit to City Hall and gorging on it in public - a way to hold up a defiant middle finger against the elites who were so useless in the face of the disease.
The Spanish flu pandemic that battered America in 1918 produced similar reactions. John M. Barry, author of "The Great Influenza," reports that as conditions worsened, health workers in city after city pleaded for volunteers to care for the sick. Few stepped forward.
In Philadelphia, the head of emergency aid pleaded for help in taking care of sick children. Nobody answered. The organization's director turned scornful: "Hundreds of women  had delightful dreams of themselves in the roles of angels of mercy.  Nothing seems to rouse them now.  There are families in which every member is ill, in which the children are actually starving because there is no one to give them food. The death rate is so high, and they still hold back."
This explains one of the puzzling features of the 1918 pandemic. When it was over, people didn't talk about it. There were very few books or plays written about it. Roughly 675,000 Americans lost their lives to the flu, compared with 53,000 in battle in World War I, and yet it left almost no conscious cultural mark.
Perhaps it's because people didn't like who they had become. It was a shameful memory and therefore suppressed. In her 1976 dissertation, "A Cruel Wind," Dorothy Ann Pettit argues that the 1918 flu pandemic contributed to a kind of spiritual torpor afterward. People emerged from it physically and spiritually fatigued. The flu, Pettit writes, had a sobering and disillusioning effect on the national spirit.
There is one exception to this sad litany: health care workers. In every pandemic there are doctors and nurses who respond with unbelievable heroism and compassion. That's happening today.
Mike Baker recently had a report in The New York Times about the EvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland, Washington, where the staff showed the kind of effective compassion that has been evident in all pandemics down the centuries. "We have not had issues with staff not wanting to come in," an Evergreen executive said. "We've had staff calling and say, If you need me, I'm available."
Maybe this time we'll learn from their example. It also wouldn't be a bad idea to take steps to fight the moral disease that accompanies the physical one.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: As cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer fly off grocery store shelves in a rush of coronavirus panic shopping, two Tennessee men are being ordered to stop hoarding and reselling in-demand products online.
Noah Colvin, of Hixson, Tennessee, took a 1,300-mile road trip in early March across Tennessee and Kentucky, racking up thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer to resell online.
Meanwhile, his brother Matt stayed at home, waiting for pallets of antibacterial wipes and even more sanitizer to be shipped, according to a New York Times article.
The two then sold sanitizer online at a steep markup – $8 to $70 a pop. But Amazon quickly removed their listings amid a larger effort to stop coronavirus-related price gouging.
Now, the brothers reportedly have more than 17,000 bottles of hand sanitizer – and two attorneys general who demand they stop buying more.

On Saturday night, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III announced his office had ordered the Colvins to stop buying and selling while they're investigated for price gouging.
“We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it,” said Slatery in a press release.
Medical goods acquired by the Colvins were reportedly taken to a nearby church Sunday to be distributed around the community, per WRCB-TV in Tennessee. A portion of the sanitizer will be returned to stores in Kentucky, the station reported.
Tennessee and Kentucky have anti-price-gouging laws to prevent necessities from being sold at a mark-up during states of emergency – a status that both states are under to fight the coronavirus.
An online petition calling on Slatery to prosecute Matt Colvin has thousands of signatures.
“This is a time where we have to focus on helping our neighbors, not profiting from them,” said Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. “We’re not going to tolerate selfish actions that put the health of Kentuckians at risk, and I’m grateful for Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery’s partnership in bringing an end to this harmful scheme. ”
Matt Colvin defended his practice in the New York Times profile, saying there is "crushing overwhelming demand" for products like sanitizer.
“The Dollar General in the middle of nowhere outside of Lexington, Kentucky, doesn’t have that," he continued.
Harrison County, the site of the first and the most of Kentucky's COVID-19 cases, is a rural area north of Lexington.
After the New York Times article published, Colvin said he was exploring ways to donate the bulk items.

Texto completo: After a disastrous performance in his first debate with Walter Mondale, many in the media began to openly question the then-73-year-old Ronald Reagan's mental fitness. Writing in the New York Times, James Reston pointed out that Reagan "got his figures mixed up, and didn't seem to be mentally alert in dealing with Mr. Mondale's arguments." The Wall Street Journal noted that "the president's rambling responses and occasional apparent confusion injected an unpredictable new element into the race" and pointed out that at age 75, "10% of people suffer from significant mental impairment - senile dementia, or senility." The networks ran montages of Reagan stumbling over his words and brought on doctors to discuss the effects of aging on mental capacity.
When the second debate came around, Reagan put the aging question to rest with his now famous line: "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience." A decade later, Reagan announced to the world that he had Alzheimer's disease.
Joe Biden is 77, four years older than Reagan was during the 1984 campaign. If Biden is elected, he'll be older on the day he takes office than Reagan was on the day he left office. So yes, his mental fitness is a legitimate issue.
There is plenty of cause for concern. Biden recently announced "I think we can win back the House" and promised to ban the "AR-14." He mistook Super Tuesday for "Super Thursday," and forgot the words of the Declaration of Independence, saying "We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created, by the, you know, you know the thing." In South Carolina, he misstated what office he was running for, declaring "My name's Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate."
On three occasions last month, Biden declared he was arrested in South Africa trying to visit Nelson Mandela in prison - an incident his campaign later admitted never happened. He earlier described meeting a Navy captain in Afghanistan, but the Washington Post reported that "almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect." He claimed to have worked with Chinese leader "Deng Xiaoping" on the Paris Climate Accord (Deng died in 1997). He claimed during a debate that "150 million people have been killed [by guns] since 2007" (which would be nearly half the U.S. population). He said he met with Parkland victims while he was vice president, even though the shooting took place after he left office.
He has declared that Democrats should "choose truth over facts" and that "poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids." He pledged to use biofuels to power "steamships." He repeatedly gets confused about what state he is in; called "Fox News Sunday" anchor Chris Wallace "Chuck"; said his late son Beau "was the attorney general of the United States"; and confused former British Prime Minister Theresa May with the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Any one of these gaffes in isolation would be nothing more than that. But taken together they form a pattern - and raise questions about whether Biden has experienced a cognitive decline. Biden's defenders say this is unfair, and some have even suggested raising it is ageism. No, it's not. His socialist rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is 78 - almost a year older than Biden - yet no one is questioning his mental fitness. On Monday night, Sanders spent an hour at a Fox News town hall where he was challenged to defend his policies and answered in great detail and without any gaffes or senior moments. Could Biden do the same?
Many of President Trump's critics have suggested that he suffers from cognitive impairment. Well, in 2018, Trump took a test designed to screen for dementia - the Montreal Cognitive Assessment - and the White House physician reported he received a perfect score. Will Biden submit to the same test?
Sanders took a subtle dig at Biden during the town hall, pointing out that while he speaks for 45 minutes to an hour at his campaign events, Biden recently spoke for seven minutes. The two men will have their first mano-a-mano debate tonight. How will Biden perform over the course of a two-hour discussion? Perhaps he will put concerns about his mental fitness to rest. This much is certain: Democrats are about to pick a man they hope will be the first octogenarian president in American history. It is fair to ask whether voters are choosing a candidate who's not up to the job.

Texto completo: The NFL and NFL Players Association settled a new collective bargaining agreement this weekend, warding off a potential work stoppage for at least another decade.
The deal, which NFL players approved by a margin of 1,019 to 959, will run through the 2030 season and includes several notable changes — to the NFL schedule, player pensions and many other fronts.
As the two sides work to iron out the final details, here are the most significant differences in the new CBA from the previous one and how they will impact the league and its players beginning as early as this fall.
A 17-game regular season
This is the big one, obviously. The new CBA paves the way for the NFL to add one more week to the regular-season schedule — a move that has long been sought by owners, and largely criticized by players.
The addition of a 17th game will give NFL owners one more week of game day revenue in the form of ticket, parking and concession sales — and, perhaps more importantly, also hike up the cost of future television broadcasting deals, which are set to be renegotiated this year. Players have largely opposed the expansion because it represents another week in which they will put their bodies at risk.
One sticking point in the negotiations was how players would be paid for this additional game. An initial proposal would've capped the amount at $250,000 per player, but that was since changed to ensure that players will receive the full prorated value of their contracts, even if it exceeds that amount.
A shortened preseason
Partly because of the 17-game regular season, the new CBA also calls for a shortened preseason schedule. Each team will play three preseason games, instead of four, beginning in 2021, with the fourth week turning into a bye.
The new CBA also limits the number of joint practices that each team can have in the preseason to four, among caps on other elements of training camp — from the length of padded and full-speed practices (no more than 2. 5 hours) to the number of days in pads (no more than 16).
The revenue split
Under the new CBA, players are guaranteed to receive 48% of the league's overall revenue beginning in 2021, with the ability to increase that share to 48. 8% "through a media kicker which applies in any season the league plays 17 games," according to an NFLPA fact sheet that was released before the deal was finalized.
The previous CBA, which was approved in 2011, guaranteed players 47% of revenue.
While there are slight variations in how revenue is calculated and split in other major pro sports leagues, NBA players are guaranteed to receive between 49% and 51% of revenue under their current CBA. NHL players receive at least 50%. Baseball's revenue-sharing system isn't quite as straightforward as others, but MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told The New York Times in 2018 that players had received "approximately 50 percent of revenue" in recent years.
Drug policy and disciplinary changes
The new CBA significantly relaxes the rules on drug testing with regards to marijuana by narrowing the window for testing (from four months to two weeks at the start of training camp) and reducing the number of players who are subjected to testing.
The deal also increases the level of THC that qualifies as a positive test, from 35 nanograms of carboxy THC per milliliter of urine to 150, and reduces penalties — including the elimination of suspensions — for players who test positive.
On a broader level, with regards to player discipline, the new CBA will stipulate that "a neutral decision-maker" will now rule on most commissioner discipline cases, taking some of the disciplinary power out of the hands of Roger Goodell, according to the NFLPA fact sheet.
Roster sizes increased
The new deal expands the size of NFL rosters from 53 players to 55, while allowing two additional players to be active on game days.
It also calls for larger practice squads and better compensation for practice-squad players. Under this deal, practice squads could soon increase to as many as 14 players per team, each making $10,500 per week — an increase of $2,500.
A new playoff format
This was not technically a bargaining issue, but it has become wrapped up in the deal: Starting as early as next season, the playoff field will expand from six teams per conference to seven, with only the top seed in each conference earning a bye week.
Under this format, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Rams each would have made the playoffs last season and faced the Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay Packers in the opening round, respectively.

'Hairspray' producer left mark on city

Texto completo: By the time Margo Lion's production of "Hairspray" won the Tony Award for best Broadway musical, I had done dozens and dozens of interviews with the Baltimore-born producer. The earliest took place in 1993 at New York's Walter Kerr Theatre, home to "Angels in America." Margo was a rare female producer in a field dominated by men, and she then had not one, but two hit shows running concurrently on Broadway - "Angels in America" and "Jelly's Last Jam."
Earlier this month, I returned to the Walter Kerr to celebrate the life of this intrepid producer - the woman who dared to turn a John Waters movie into a Broadway musical. Margo Lion died of a brain aneurysm on January 24; she was 75.
During his remarks at the memorial celebration, filmmaker John Waters said Margo "got out of Baltimore early and never looked back." Maybe. But Baltimore influenced her life and she left her influence on Baltimore - and beyond.
This widespread influence stemmed primarily from her most successful show, "Hairspray." The musical was adapted from Mr. Waters' 1988 movie, which was in turn inspired by "The Buddy Deane Show" - WJZ's popular mid-20th century teen dance program. The Broadway musical was subsequently transformed into both a feature film and a live TV broadcast.
To date, the musical has been translated into eight languages and performed on stages from South Africa to Peru. Because of this, audiences throughout the world see Baltimore as a place where a fictitious outcast - a hefty teen-aged girl - can open hearts and change minds about such tough issues as racism, prejudice and bullying.
Through her support of the Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women, where she served on the advisory board, Margo provided real-life teenage girls with a role model who proved that if you follow your heart, you can make a difference.
Many Broadway stars performed at her memorial -Tonya Pinkins, Betty Buckley, LaChanze and more. But one of the highlights was a performance by a dozen high school students who'd never been on Broadway - Lethal Ladies, the Baltimore school's step team. At the end of their percussive, precision performance, they proclaimed in unison: "We are her legacy!"
Margo liked to say that one reason she was so taken with "Hairspray" was because it was "about something." Whether she was producing a Broadway show, teaching at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, serving as co-chair of President Obama's Committee on the Arts and Humanities or taking her young granddaughters to the theater, Margo was always about something. One of those things was supporting shows, theater artists and young people she believed in.
She was a visionary who gave a major Broadway boost to songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, playwright Tony Kushner and playwright/director George C. Wolfe. They all paid tribute to Margo. So did many others -- via video - including Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow and first lady Michelle Obama, who praised Margo for "honoring the experiences of people on whom the light rarely settled."
In her eulogy, Susan Birkenhead, who wrote the lyrics for two of Margo's Broadway musicals, claimed that "Triumph of Love" was the show closest to Margo's spirit. The musical played its world premiere at Baltimore Center Stage in 1996. Ms. Birkenhead said Margo identified with its protagonist - a tomboy princess who lets nothing keep her from her goal.
For Margo, achieving the goal of producing risky Broadway shows often involved mortgaging her New York apartment and signing over ownership of her most valuable possession - a Matisse sculpture. She had inherited the sculpture at age 18, after her parents were killed in a plane crash in Egypt.
At the start of Monday's celebration, the original Broadway cast of "Hairspray" sang the musical's opening number, "Good Morning Baltimore," a song that could be Baltimore's anthem. At the end of the celebration, they were joined on stage by dozens of subsequent "Hairspray" cast members, all singing the show's rousing, concluding number, "You Can't Stop the Beat."
The last show Margo worked on, a musical adaptation of the novel, "The Secret Life of Bees," premiered off-Broadway this past June. A few days before the celebration of her life, a number of Broadway theaters, including the Walter Kerr, dimmed lights in her memory.
And yet, Margo Lion's "beat" will remain unstoppable. It's there in the shows she produced, the people she nurtured and the examples she set.

Texto completo: One Tuesday night in October 2018, John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery store chain, was having dinner at Cipriani, an upscale Manhattan restaurant when his daughter, Andrea, walked in.
She was on a date with a man Catsimatidis didn't recognize. After the couple sat down at another table, Catsimatidis asked a waiter to go over and take a photo.
Catsimatidis then uploaded the picture to a facial recognition app, Clearview AI, on his phone. The startup behind the app has a database of billions of photos, scraped from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
Within seconds, Catsimatidis was viewing a collection of photos of the mystery man, along with the web addresses where they appeared: His daughter's date was a venture capitalist from San Francisco.
"I wanted to make sure he wasn't a charlatan," said Catsimatidis, who then texted the man's bio to his daughter.
Andrea Catsimatidis said she and her date had no idea how her father had identified him so quickly.
"I expect my dad to be able to do crazy things. He's very technologically savvy," she said. "My date was very surprised."
Clearview was unknown to the general public until this January, when The New York Times reported that the secretive startup had developed a breakthrough facial recognition system that was in use by hundreds of law enforcement agencies. The company quickly faced a backlash on multiple fronts.
Facebook, Google and other tech giants sent cease-and-desist letters.
Lawsuits were filed in Illinois, Vermont and Virginia, and the attorney general of New Jersey issued a moratorium against the app in that state.
In response to the criticism, Clearview published a "code of conduct," emphasizing in a blog post that its technology was "available only for law enforcement agencies and select security professionals to use as an investigative tool."
The post added: "We recognize that powerful tools always have the potential to be abused, regardless of who is using them, and we take the threat very seriously.
Accordingly, the Clearview app has built-in safeguards to ensure these trained professionals only use it for its intended purpose: to help identify the perpetrators and victims of crimes."
The Times, however, has identified multiple individuals with active access to Clearview's technology who are not law enforcement officials.
And for more than a year before the company became the subject of public scrutiny, the app had been freely used in the wild by the company's investors, clients and friends.
Those with Clearview logins used facial recognition at parties, on dates and at business gatherings, giving demonstrations of its power for fun or using it to identify people whose names they didn't know or couldn't recall.
"As part of the ordinary course of due diligence, we provided trial accounts to potential and current investors, and other strategic partners, so they could test the technology," said Hoan Ton-That, the company's co-founder.
John Catsimatidis first heard about Clearview from his friend Richard Schwartz, another founder of the company, who served as an aide to Rudy Giuliani when Giuliani was mayor of New York. Last summer, Catsimatidis ran a trial project with Clearview at one of his markets. The company used the system to identify known "shoplifters or people who had held up other stores," Catsimatidis said.
"People were stealing our Häagen-Dazs. It was a big problem," he said. He described Clearview as a "good system" that helped security personnel identify problem shoppers.
BuzzFeed News has reported that two other entities, a labor union and a real estate firm, also ran trials with a surveillance system developed by Clearview to flag individuals they deemed risky.
The publication also reported that Clearview's software has been used by Best Buy, Macy's, Kohl's, the National Basketball Association and numerous other organizations.
When Clearview first developed its facial recognition service in 2017, Ton-That and Schwartz were uncertain about who might pay for it, and they courted a range of clients including real estate firms, banks and retailers.
At the same time, Clearview was seeking outside investment. Many of the individuals the company approached got personal logins to the app.
Clearview received a seed investment round of about $1 million in July 2018.
Its backers included the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist David Scalzo and Hal Lambert, an investor in Texas who runs an exchange-traded fund with the ticker symbol "MAGA," which tracks companies that align with Republican politics.
"I have the app," Lambert said in an interview. "I've used it to talk about what we're doing in the space. I show it to friends of mine, potential investors.
"They thought it was amazing," he added. "They say, 'How do I get that?' And I say, 'You can't.' "
When Clearview was seeking its Series A round of funding, which was completed in 2019, the startup contacted a number of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures. Access to the app was offered as a perk, according to people familiar with the company's fundraising attempts.
Ton-That contends that Clearview is doing nothing wrong - that his app simply replicates what other search engines do.
Instead of allowing internet users to search for people's public images by name, as one can do on Google, he said, Clearview allows them to do the search by uploading a face.
For now, it's a power that Clearview controls and can give out as it pleases.
In October, Clearview asked Nicholas Cassimatis, an expert on artificial intelligence, to help conduct an internal accuracy test. He did the work for free, he said, because he knew Ton-That socially. The test consisted of submitting the faces of 834 federal and state legislators. Clearview's algorithms accurately identified every one of the politicians.
After the test was complete, Cassimatis was allowed to keep Clearview's app on his phone. He said he had since run dozens of searches.
"I tested it in surprising places: smoky bars, dark places. And it worked every time," Cassimatis said. "It's road testing. I do it as a hobby. I ask people for permission. It's like a parlor trick. People like it."

Texto completo: Howard Wolinsky is a medical journalist in Flossmoor, Illinois, who knows better than to go forward with potentially life-changing surgery without first seeking a second opinion.
Nine years ago, at age 63, when a PSA blood test followed by a biopsy revealed cancer in Wolinsky's prostate gland, the diagnosing urologist said he could operate to remove the offending organ the following week.
Not so fast, Wolinsky thought, knowing this was not a minor operation and one that often left men temporarily or permanently impotent, incontinent or both. So before having surgery Wolinsky consulted Dr. Scott Eggener, a University of Chicago urologist, who reviewed the test results and proposed an alternative strategy called "active surveillance."
Not to be confused with "watchful waiting," active surveillance is not a do-nothing approach. Rather, patients are routinely monitored and referred for surgery or radiation therapy only if their cancer begins to grow or show molecular signs of aggression.
Current estimates are that about half of men found to have prostate cancer could avoid radical treatment and its potential side effects if they were willing to live with having a cancer, albeit a seemingly benign one, in their bodies.
These are men whose cancer is deemed, based on its biological characteristics, to be low risk in terms of progressing to a potentially life-threatening state.
Only if periodic exams reveal that a man's cancer is shown to be progressing to a more aggressive state would more radical treatment be considered. For men who choose active surveillance, Eggener said, this generally affects about 5% annually for the first five to 10 years.
Other reasons for abandoning active surveillance and undergoing radical treatment include the patients' growing anxiety about living with cancer and pressure from family members, and sometimes even from their doctors to "get it out," clinicians report.
Watchful waiting, which involves little or no monitoring, is still sometimes suggested but mainly reserved for men with a limited life expectancy for other reasons or those whose health status makes surgery inadvisable.
Based on his PSA of less than 4 and a Gleason score of 6, Wolinsky said, "Dr. Eggener told me, 'You're the perfect candidate - the poster child for active surveillance.' "
The Gleason score is a measure of the cancer's aggressiveness, and a composite score of less than 7 is generally deemed low-risk disease.
So starting in 2010, Wolinsky had a PSA test and digital rectal exam every six months and an annual biopsy of the prostate, which was eventually lengthened to every three years. It's now been four years since the last biopsy, and chances are, unless a worrisome rise in the PSA occurs and other tests indicate an aggressive cancer, he may never need another.
Given the now rapidly changing methods of monitoring and diagnosing the lethality of prostate cancer, it behooves every man told he has cancer in this gland to explore the most currently available management options before deciding on treatment. There are now even support groups to help reassure men with a low-risk cancer who choose active surveillance.
"The field is on fire," said Dr. Laurence Klotz, a leading expert on urological cancer and pioneer of active surveillance.
"Within a few years, we'll have urine and blood tests that are so reliable we'll know which men don't even need a biopsy. Instead of a biopsy, there are now at least five biomarkers and more being developed that can be used as an initial test."
Even the process of biopsy has changed.
For decades, when a possible cancer was suspected based on the PSA test or digital rectal exam, doctors blindly took 12 core samples from the prostate to search for a malignancy. Now an MRI can be done first and a biopsy performed only if and when a potentially serious lesion is revealed. High-resolution ultrasound may even become a simpler and less expensive alternative to an MRI, Klotz said.
To avoid the need for a biopsy, Klotz is leading a large Canadian clinical trial, called Precise, to determine if an MRI is sufficiently accurate in detecting dangerous cancers and distinguishing them from harmless ones. He estimates, based on early data, that as many as 250,000 men a year in Canada and the United States could avoid unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to identify clinically significant cancers.
This approach results in the diagnosis of many fewer indolent cancers that would most likely never threaten a man's life, said Klotz, a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto.
"With an MRI, we find fewer of these low-grade cancers, and fewer men will be overtreated," he said.
If Eggener had his way, he would not even call it cancer for men with a Gleason score of 6 or lower because "it fails to meet the clinical definition of cancer: the ability to cause symptoms, metastasize or lead to death," he wrote in an email. "Removing the cancer label has been done in other cancers, most notably a subtype of thyroid and bladder cancers. I predict this will eventually happen for Gleason 6 prostate cancer and be reason for celebration."

‘RINK LIFE’
Did you know the MacArthur Foundation grants “genius” awards not only to individuals, but also to “creative and effective institutions”? The only dance company so recognized is Lucky Plush Productions, based in Chicago. Make way for the ensemble’s current “Rink Life,” a mash-up of theater, physical comedy, social commentary and, yes, dance, inspired by the roller rinks of a half-century ago. The dialogue ain’t Shakespeare, friends, Romans, countrymen. Video clips suggest scattershot storylines, enacted by performers who play only themselves. But the movement is loose, wild and limber to the max. (Where the heck are the skates?)— Lucky Plus Productions presents “Rink Life” at 7:30 pm. March 26 at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater. Tickets: $ 20- $ 45.
ART MAUI 2020
Benedict Heywood, juror of Art Maui 2020, trained at London’s prestigious Courtauld Institute of Art. Part of his stated objective in curating the 42nd edition of our local blockbuster was to give a representative cross section of creative practice here on the Valley Isle. This he has accomplished, showcasing many of the usual suspects gallery- hoppers will recognize from the 2020 Annual Juried Exhibition at Hui No‘eau. With vastly larger space at his disposal, Heywood has selected 123 winning entries. To judge by the selection, he has a thing for polished surfaces; his is a very shiny show. The Hui had no art glass, so a big mahalo for examples by the Lowrys, Chris and Marianne (entering separately). Kudos to Scott Henry Buettner for his square, sleek and spooky “Octopus” table on inlaid wood. Another favorite or two or three: Patricia Chaney’s matched pair “Salt Water Swim, Fresh Water Rinse” (I, II), with its day-off South Shore vibe; Jack Hamilton’s framed plaque “Silver Seascape With Dolphins,” small enough to double as a large pin; and Linda Ewing’s jaunty merman “Ali‘i e Kai,” with his board, his shell necklace, his tats and that aloha glint in his eye. — Art Maui 2020 is on display 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily, through April 3, in the MACC’s Schaefer International Gallery. Free admission.

Can you hire hit man on dark web?

Texto completo: On a website called Azerbaijani Eagles, you can commission a murder for $5,000. The site Slayers Hitmen provides more options, with a beating going for $2,000. Death by torture costs $50,000.
But don't expect someone to get the job done. Experts and law enforcers who have studied these sites -- almost all of them on the so-called dark web or dark net -- say they are scams. There has not been a known murder attributed to any of them.
That doesn't mean the sites aren't involved in a very dark trade. They have become catch points for real people who are looking to pay to have someone killed. And a number of men and women are sitting in jail after paying one of these sites -- and getting caught by police.
In one of the most recent cases to make its way through the courts, a nurse from Illinois was sentenced to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to sending $12,000 in bitcoin to the site Sicilian Hitmen International Network. She had hoped to have the wife of her boyfriend killed.
Twenty-four hit-man-for-hire sites are the subject of an academic paper that was shared in advance with The New York Times by Michigan State University professor Tom Holt and student Ariel Roddy.
The paper is the first academic effort to illuminate what has been a subject of endless intrigue. For years, the potential anonymity granted by the internet has fed predictions that there would be marketplaces for death and assassination.
But it was the emergence of the dark web over the past decade or so that allowed hitman sites to proliferate. Unlike most sites on the traditional internet, dark-web sites use technology that allows both sides of an online interaction to hide their identity and location, from each other and law enforcement.
"It's a fantastic opportunity to defraud people because you give them just enough sense of danger," said Emily Wilson, head of research at Terbium Labs, a security company focused on the dark net. "What are you going to do if they don't go through with it?"
When the first hit-man sites were discovered, an assumption was that the dark web was crawling with legitimate assassins waiting to kill on command.
Promotional material posted to the mainstream internet played on that assumption. One site, which provides readers with a link to the dark net address of the 18th Street Gang, holds itself out as a "guide to real hit men, facts and stories." The site claims that people who say hit-man sites are scams are just trying to discourage people from seeking them out.
"Most customers order from reliable hit men sites that have been proven as legitimate," the site says.
On many of the sites examined by the team at Michigan State, considerable effort was expended trying to prove their legitimacy so customers would feel comfortable making a payment in Bitcoin, the digital currency. Hit men are not the sort of thing you pay for with a credit card.
The site 18th Street Mafia includes a page with links to news stories about real killings it says it helped commit. None of the articles, however, indicate that the site, or even a hit man, was responsible.
The site says: "We can provide video proof of our services, with time stamps. Again, such proof is not possible for fake services."
The 18th Street Mafia did not respond to requests for comment.
The representative for another site, Darkmamba, said in an email that proving its legitimacy had been difficult because "the point of our services and many other, including underground criminal forums, is to indeed complete the job without leaving anything that could get traced back to us."
The most prolific research on these sites has been conducted by Chris Monteiro, a systems administrator in London who has pursued his investigations as a morbid passion project on top of his regular job.
Monteiro hacked into one of the sites created by the most notorious purveyor of assassination sites, a figure going by the name Yura.
After breaking into the Besa Mafia site and a few others, Monteiro found information about 283 people who had paid for hit-man services. He also found messages suggesting that the operators had little intention of going through with the killings.
"I need you to help me do some videos to prove the Besa Mafia legit, but WITHOUT killing anyone," the operator wrote in one email, trying to get a contractor to produce lifelike videos. "I am not a murderer and I don't want anyone be murdered."
Law enforcement agencies around the world have been hesitant to collaborate with Monteiro or use his evidence because of the way he acquired it. But Monteiro has worked with media organizations, including Wired and 48 Hours, which have passed his information to law enforcement officials, eventually leading to the arrests of people who paid the sites to connect them with a hit man.
Monteiro has identified nine cases in which people he exposed were arrested in connection with commissioning hits. In one of the most gruesome cases, a man in Minnesota was arrested after he was found to have killed his wife himself when the hit man he had commissioned on the Besa Mafia website for about $6,000 in bitcoin did not come through.
A police investigator in Russia is believed to have been killed by two teenagers who were hired by a drug trafficker on the dark net. An investigation by the BBC found that the killing had been commissioned on one of the broad marketplaces on the dark net where drugs and stolen credit cards are sold.
But there has still not been a killing commissioned on one of the dedicated hit-man-for-hire sites.
"Why would you set up a dedicated site online when you know absolutely that law enforcement are going to be flooding that site trying to find you?" Wilson said. "You are making yourself too big of a target."
Still, the sites have continued to proliferate. A few months ago, a middle-age executive in Singapore was sent to jail for five years after paying the Camorra Hitman site to kill the boyfriend of his young ex-lover in a staged car accident that, not surprisingly, didn't happen.
Wilson, of Terbium Labs, said these sites took attention from the real crime being committed on the dark net, such as the drug markets and the sites selling the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans.
"There is actual crime, but we are too busy talking about some guy who wants to kill his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend," she said.

The AIDS era, 1606 London -- a crisis can reshape the arts

Texto completo: There are those who say the coronavirus pandemic is a temporary headwind. But many economists are declaring this to be a earth-shaking juncture, a time when forces that usually move independently, and at glacial speeds, are all making massive shifts at once.
"There are rare moments when the world economy seems to be reconfiguring itself beneath our feet," wrote economics analyst Neil Irwin in The New York Times on March 9. "These can be startlingly fast bursts, not obvious to people who are just going about their business, but glaringly so to those who interpret the moves of financial markets.
"March 2020, it is now abundantly clear, is one of those moments."
Art and culture aren't the same as the bond or oil markets. But those worlds too can make sudden, drastic shifts. History suggests this might be one.
Take what happened in 1606, the year that William Shakespeare wrote "King Lear," "Macbeth" and "Antony and Cleopatra." In James Shapiro's book about that year, the Columbia University historian argues that this colossal burst of creative activity was a result of Shakespeare's engagement with a "fraught cultural moment" and a "troubled national mood."
Hence the surfeit of great plays focused on "regicide, civil strife and anarchy."
That sounds a lot like the Chicago theater shows I've been reviewing these last few months, and you could say much the same for the stuff on TV. Regicide might be going too far (unless, like me, you are a fan of HBO's "Succession"), but most playwrights and screenwriters have been obsessed with the historicism of civil strife: a reaction, self-evidently, to the clash between the ideology of the presidential administration and progressive artists.
But in July 1606, the bubonic plague hit and, suddenly, the theaters were closed.
Comparisons between the Elizabethan version of the plague and the coronavirus are problematic, although they have been cropping up these last few days. The plague meant near-certain death, and its appearance that year wasn't sudden or even a great surprise. The threat of pestilence was part of life -- 30,000 people had died in Britain just two years earlier.
But Shapiro's book notes that London theaters were engaged in some pretty gruesome on-the-ground decision-making, responding to a City Council decree that performances should cease when the number of deaths in a week exceeded 30. We're not at that point yet, thank heavens.
Since it was a for-profit entity, just like Broadway, Shakespeare's Globe had a powerful economic incentive to keep going; to stop meant no income for artists and orange sellers. To cancel was to put people out of work, to allow poetry to languish unspoken, to bring costs of its own.
You can see those same forces at work now as America tries to decide what must be canceled and at what cost: Government leaders, who have much to lose if they are perceived as indecisive or complicit, are far more conservative than business owners, who have more to lose if they go kaput. It all follows a timeless logic.
But back to Shapiro's arguments about the consequence. Plague, he points out, was weird in its trajectory, devastating some neighborhoods and sparing others entirely (not unlike the wildfires that spread through the hills of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, a few years ago). Shakespeare's home was in a lucky neighborhood at first but eventually succumbed, with the deaths including the Bard's own landlady.
Now it's always tricky to draw too tight a connection between what happens in a writer's life and what happens in their imaginative acts. Not everyone who writes sad movies is depressed; comedy writers are often survivors of tough circumstances.
But it's still interesting, and relevant, to note that Shakespeare made the shift from the big tragedies to plays such as "Pericles," a drama obsessed with our individual vulnerability, or "The Tempest," which is about the resolution of a shipwreck. And then there is "The Winter's Tale," a play that seriously asks the question of whether it is possible for a person thought dead to come back to life.
In other words, he skirted away from "regicide, civil strife and anarchy" and toward mortality. In times of crisis, the common enemy can change fast.
Now you can't divorce politics from a health crisis: Healing resources reflect existing inequalities, and it is far easy for some to survive disruption than others. And governments have a sworn duty to protect us. If they are widely seen as derelict in their duty, they hardly can complain if they find themselves replaced.
Still, as was the case during the AIDS crisis and in the months following the Sept. 11 atrocities, "regicide, civil strife and anarchy" tend to be replaced with great writers musing on the existence of God or the utility of religion, as Tony Kushner did in "Angels in America," and they start to see that there are forces in the world that level us all.
And the marketplace tends to reward those writers. In this era, people quickly become frustrated with works that rip us apart and seek out storytelling that reminds us of our common humanity. Heroes and saviors, outmoded these last three or four years, come roaring back.
You can already see the impact of this change on the political landscape, with its reassertion of the center. The cultural playbook is being upended too. Right now.
It will just take a while for all of this to become clear.

Texto completo: Jeremy P. ("Jerry") Mulderig of Chicago died peacefully on March 7, 2020, at Amita/Presence St. Joseph Hospital, from complications related to cancer.
He was 69.
Mulderig was born in Kingston, PA in 1950, the first child of Gerald A. and Mary F. Mulderig.
He graduated second in his class of 1968 from Central Catholic High School in Kingston.
At the University of Scranton, he was Editor of The Aquinas, the University student newspaper.
In 1972, shortly after his graduation with high honors from the University, he moved to Germany, as a Fulbright Fellow, for advanced study at the University of Cologne.
In 1973, he entered the English doctoral program at The Ohio State University, from which he received his Ph.D. in 1978.
What followed was a distinguished 40-year career of scholarship and teaching in the areas of rhetoric and writing, 19th century literature and biography, and LGBTQ studies.
Mulderig's college-level teaching career began at Graceland College in Lamoni, Iowa, in 1978.
He taught at Oakland University in 1981-1982, then moved to the Newcomb College of Tulane University in 1982.
In 1988, he accepted a position as Associate Professor in the English Department of DePaul University.
From 1990 to 1997, he was Chair of DePaul's English Department.
In 2004, in recognition of his excellence in teaching he was awarded membership in the prestigious Society of Vincent de Paul Professors, and upon his retirement in 2014, he received the Via Sapientiae, the University's highest honor.
A truly gifted writer, Mulderig was the author of many published academic research papers, and of multiple editions of The Heath Handbook.
In the last five years of his life, he published two books with The University of Chicago Press, in each of which he edited and annotated the writings of Samuel Steward.
The first of these, Philip Sparrow Tells All, was widely reviewed, including in the New York Times.
The second, The Lost Autobiography of Samuel Steward, was launched in April 2018 to high acclaim from both popular and academic reviewers, including a review in the London Review of Books published weeks before his death.
In 2004, Mulderig purchased an apartment in Berlin, and subsequently enjoyed splitting his time nearly equally between his Chicago and Berlin homes.
Family and friends are planning a memorial service to be held in Chicago at some point in the future.
Mulderig is survived by a loving family: his brother Bob Mulderig and sister-in-law Karen Garman, and nephew and niece Patrick Mulderig and Emily Mulderig, all of Washington, DC; and sister Maureen Mulderig and brother-in-law Michael Johnson of State College, PA, and step-niece and -nephew Jennifer Johnson and Bryan Johnson.
Equally important, he is survived by a community of hundreds of devoted former students, academic colleagues, and friends throughout the nation and around the world, many of whom have offered testimony to the significant role Jeremy Mulderig played in their lives.
His impact on this world was profound, and he is, and will be, dearly missed.

COVID-19 testing a snap in Australia

Texto completo: Tom Hanks had a cold, or so he thought: slight fever, body aches, chills, the usual.
In the United States, those symptoms may not be enough to get tested for the new coronavirus. But he and his wife, Rita Wilson, who also felt sick, weren't at home -- they were in Australia.
Here, testing is free and widely available, thanks to early and coordinated planning for a pandemic.
On Thursday, Hanks said he and his wife had seen the efforts firsthand, as they tested positive for the virus.
"The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed," Hanks wrote in an announcement he posted on Twitter, choosing capital letters for his new acquaintances. "We Hanks' will be tested, observed and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires."
Hanks is now the public face of a pandemic's widening reach. What was once a national problem for China, where the virus originated and soon killed thousands, has become an international stress test for public health performance.
Some countries, like the United States, are looking increasingly ill prepared, or, in the case of Italy, fighting to avoid being overwhelmed.
Others, like South Korea, moved quickly to test and isolate huge numbers of people and appear to be bringing their outbreaks under control.
Although Canada has relatively few cases, so far, its testing system is also well developed, a result of the SARS outbreak in the country 17 years ago, when 44 people died and 438 were infected.
Australia, with more than 130 cases and three deaths, has not yet been put to the same kind of test as Italy or South Korea.
But health officials are determined to be ready for whatever comes -- heads down on their spreadsheets, trying to stay calm in a battle where planning ahead and avoiding drama mean victory.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, still bruised from a failure to react quickly to the country's bush-fire crisis this summer, set an emergency coronavirus plan in motion Feb. 28. Rather than play down the risks or promise that the problem would fade in a month or two -- as President Donald Trump did -- Morrison was one of the first world leaders to declare that the virus would span the planet.
"We believe the risk of global pandemic is very much upon us," he said weeks ago, as cases were just starting to rise quickly outside China. "And, as a result, as a government, we need to take the steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic."
That same day, state and territory health ministers met to discuss plans for testing, stockpiling medication and opening special clinics that would keep potential coronavirus patients out of regular emergency rooms. The officials have continued to meet regularly.
"In terms of the amount of time and human hours that have gone into the planning, it's massive," said Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland who has been involved. "It's been going on all year, really, and entire lives have gone into just planning and coordinating. It's been all-consuming."
Testing has been a priority from the beginning.
Days after China shared the genome of the virus, Australia's private testing industry -- which handles everything from blood tests to stool samples -- was mobilized, with the government making tests free through Medicare, the national health care plan.
Public health officials set up a national hotline for people who think they might have the virus. States have set up webpages with locations for coronavirus testing, which has mostly been taking place in hospital wards set apart from regular emergency rooms.
In the United States, little if anything about the process has been efficient or convenient.
Tests have been slow to arrive across the country, in part because of a manufacturing problem, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Criteria for who should be tested have been widened only recently.
At first, the CDC recommended testing only those who had traveled to Wuhan, China, or had contact with a suspected coronavirus case and had a fever or respiratory symptoms.
In late February, the guidelines were relaxed, but a patient still had to be hospitalized to be eligible for a test.
Vice President Mike Pence announced March 3 that the CDC would lift those restrictions, granting tests if a physician ordered them, but doctors were asked to keep certain factors in mind before doing so. And laboratories are still reporting that the demand for testing is greater than the supply.
In Australia, shortages have been rare, and contact tracing has been comprehensive.
On Thursday, Annastacia Palaszczuk, the premier of Queensland, the state where Hanks is hospitalized, said there were 27 people confirmed to have the coronavirus there, and in every case, "we know the origin of where they have come from."
She did not say whether Hanks and Wilson had contracted the virus in Australia or brought it from the United States.
Mackay, the virologist, noted that Wilson, an actress and singer, had recently performed a concert in Beverly Hills, California, on a date within the incubation period for the virus. Hanks is in Australia shooting a film about Elvis Presley with Australian director Baz Luhrmann; there were reports that at least one other person on the set had tested positive.
Palaszczuk said everyone who had come into contact with Hanks and Wilson would have to self-isolate, and she promised that they would be well treated. They were two of seven new cases reported in Queensland on Thursday, and they are officially listed as being in stable condition at Gold Coast University Hospital, where they are being kept in isolation.
Under the protocols Hanks referred to on Twitter, doctors and health officials will regularly check on them.
"I'm very confident that we have world-class doctors that are determined to look after them and give them the best possible care," Palaszczuk said.
She then added a warning: "What this signals is that this coronavirus can happen to anyone," she said, adding: "We need the public to be listening to the authorities, listening very closely and adhering."
Which is what Hanks and Wilson seem to be doing: taking direction from medical officials.
In 2013, Hanks disclosed he has Type 2 diabetes.
"They're not tripping, but they're going through the necessary health precautions, obviously," their son Chet Hanks said in a message on Instagram. "I don't think it's anything to worry about."

Tortured journey to get tested for virus another view

Texto completo: My story starts on Feb. 15 at a Sun Sentinel going-away party for nine colleagues who'd accepted the company's buyout offer. About 45 of us showed up, all hugs and kisses. Within five days, at least 18 of us were sick.
Some of us got sicker than others. My younger colleagues mostly got flu-like symptoms - fever, bronchitis, muscle aches. But a couple of us got hit hard - spiking fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
My symptoms felt nothing like a cold or flu. Within a day and a half, the whistle in my lungs was so loud that a friend joked I should break out the spoons for a jig. I had all the symptoms of coronavirus: a fever, cough, shortness of breath and a deep respiratory infection. At the urgent care center, the doctor diagnosed pneumonia.
Our newsroom remained a-twitter. Who has what symptoms? Has anyone gotten tested for coronavirus?
A newsroom sleuth scoured Facebook and found one of our former colleagues had just returned from Asia, with a layover in China. Our colleague's post showed an airport and airplane awash in face masks. Upon arriving in New York, our friend self-quarantined as directed for three days and developed no symptoms. Seven days later, our colleague was wrapped in our embrace.
I have no idea if my friend was a carrier. As Kingsley Guy, my predecessor as editorial page editor, put it: "We'll never know, but chances are good that we were among the first people in Florida to come down with the coronavirus."
I tried to get tested. I called the Broward County Health Department, but the person on the phone wasn't interested in our too-big-for-coincidence cluster.
After a 10-day antibiotic regimen, I felt well enough to travel to D.C. for a friend's memorial and work in the office for a couple of days. But mostly I worked from home, too tired to make the trek.
Until now, the only time I ever remember paying such close attention to my breathing was when I tried meditation and yoga. But one night this past week, my breathing was so labored, it was all I could hear. I felt like I needed an oxygen mask.
In China, people with pneumonia are included in the 80 percent of cases considered "minor," a New York Times science reporter said on The Daily podcast.
"Even if you have a very mild case, you're going to go in with all the other mild cases, because they know cases can crash," said Donald G. McNeil, Jr. who has covered the story from the start.
On Friday, I became determined to get the test. I did so even knowing that the virus' RNA lasts only a median of 20 days in respiratory samples, Chinese doctors wrote in The Lancet. But they also said it could last as long as 37 days.
It had been 27 days since my possible exposure. Still, I wanted to know, am I contagious after taking antibiotics? How much longer will this last?
But perhaps you've heard, getting tested is nigh-on impossible.
I called the COVID-19 Call Center listed on the Florida Department of Health's website. The nice woman on the phone said the hotline was a call center, not a medical center. She encouraged me to call the county health department.
I called the Broward health department again, but after hearing I hadn't traveled or come in contact with a known case, the operator said I should call my doctor or a commercial lab.
I called Quest, and was told I needed a physician's order. My doctor called in the order, but when I called to make an appointment at Quest, I was told my doctor had to submit the sample. I called my doctor's office, but they said they didn't have the necessary kit.
I called Dr. Shahnaz Fatteh, president of the Broward County Medical Association. "We're all scrambling to find out how to get the test kits," she said.
I called Jaime Caldwell, president of the South Florida Hospital Association. He'd previously told me that hospitals hope people with minor cases don't fill up their emergency rooms, potentially infecting others or consuming resources needed by the sickest. "But you have to do what's best for you."
So I texted Aurelio Fernandez, the CEO of Memorial Healthcare, and told him I was headed to Hollywood Memorial. My temperature was only 99, but it had been 100.2 Thursday, and the symptoms got worse at night.
At the hospital, I answered YES to most of the screening questions. In the last 14 days: yes, I'd been sick; yes, I'd had a low-grade fever; yes, I'd had trouble breathing; yes, I'd been around others who were sick. As to whether I'd been exposed to a known Covid-19 patient, I said "maybe."
I was placed in a negative-pressure treatment room and treated by people wearing extra protection. A nurse swabbed both nostrils high enough to "tickle your brain," then deeply swabbed my throat.
I kept apologizing for using emergency room resources, even as I wondered how much I will wind up paying to get tested.
Coincidentally, while the doctor was examining me, I received a call from Jared Moskowitz, Florida's director of emergency management. I promised to call him back. I asked the doctor: "What would you ask him?" His answer: When are we going to get the tests we need?
Moskowitz told me the state has been following CDC criteria, but new supplies are on the way, with the state having ordered 625,000 kits.
Late Friday, I received an email saying my test results were available online. The results said the coronavirus had not been detected.
The doctor told me that it's impossible to know if I had the virus. But as Kingsley said, I believe we were among Florida's first coronavirus patients - and it shouldn't have been so hard to find out.
Editor's note: As of this writing, no one at the Sun Sentinel has tested positive for COVID-19.

Texto completo: As it turns out, Democrats want change, not a revolution.
In 11 days, former Vice President Joe Biden went from nearly out of the presidential race to nearly the party's nominee. On Tuesday, Florida and three other key states likely will make his nomination inevitable.
Numbers from last week's primaries make clear the breadth and depth of Biden's support against Sen. Bernie Sanders.
No state makes it clearer than Michigan. Four years ago, Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton, an upset that galvanized his candidacy. This year, Sanders lost the state to Biden by 16 points and got drubbed across every demographic except voters age 29 and under. Some small counties that Sanders won in 2016 by 25 points went for Biden by a similar margin.
Democratic turnout surged in Michigan, as it has in other states. Michigan especially matters, however, because President Trump won the state by just 10,000 votes. Biden's supporters argue that his emerging coalition could rebuild the Democrats' Midwestern "Blue Wall" of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which Trump flipped to win the White House.
Sanders has claimed that he could energize young voters and bring enough new voters into the system to form a new coalition and defeat Trump. The numbers disprove that theory.
In 11 of the first 12 states to hold primaries or caucuses this year, the share of the under-29 vote dropped. Though Sanders won primaries in New Hampshire and Vermont, his share of the young vote dropped in both states. There also has been no increase in first-time voters.
Meanwhile, Biden has been expanding his coalition. He has continued to win big among African-Americans. He also beat Sanders among white voters in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi by double digits.
Sanders went hard after white voters without a college degree, but Biden carried that group. Sanders hit Biden often for approving NAFTA, but in Missouri, Biden won among union members by 28 points. Biden carried the suburbs and another key constituency - white women with college degrees.
Over and over, Sanders has claimed that the United States is ready for a "revolution." After losing the nomination to Hillary Clinton, Sanders and his backers theorized that Democrats would be even hungrier for radical change after four years of Trump.
In fact, analysts have noted, some of Sanders' approval in 2016 likely was more a rejection of Clinton. "This was especially true among moderates," the New York Times reported, "who wouldn't naturally gravitate toward a self-described democratic socialist."
"On Super Tuesday, in every single state, Bernie Sanders earned a smaller share of the vote than he earned in those same states in 2016," wrote the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country.
And this past Tuesday, Sanders lost big even after the withdrawal of Elizabeth Warren, who also had identified with strongly liberal voters.
Still, Biden will need the Sanders coalition. Its members are energized. They could bring the expertise to battle Trump's social media campaign, which already sent out a doctored video in which Biden appears to endorse the president.
And Biden shares Sanders' priorities: greater access to health care, lower prescription drug prices, a tax system that does not favor the wealthy and corporations, lower student loan debt, action on climate change.
The coronavirus pandemic underscores how unaligned Sanders is from most Americans. With the nation worried about access and affordability of testing and possible treatment, Sanders would force everyone into a government-run plan - without explaining how he would pay for it.
There are ways to improve health care without trying a dangerous experiment. There are ways to make capitalism fairer without ending capitalism. There are ways to address global warming without going cold turkey on fossil fuels and risking economic turmoil.
The need for calm, reasoned leadership of the kind Biden displayed during his speech Tuesday night rarely has been more evident. As Biden's campaign has surged, Trump has shown again how singularly unqualified he is to be president.
Wednesday evening, Trump delivered a fact-challenged address meant to calm the coronavirus panic. Instead, markets sold off even more dramatically.
That's because Trump spoke about the economy when people wanted to hear about public health, especially the availability of test kits. On Wednesday, 23 of Florida's 27 U.S. House members asked the administration for resources and guidance that should have come weeks ago, when Trump was calling the virus a "hoax" by Democrats.
Trump seemed similarly detached at the White House on Thursday. Discussing the virus and its impacts, he referenced his "big rallies" and his "beautiful buildings" as a developer.
The nation desperately needs an alternative to the malignant narcissist in the White House. Democrats are saying that it won't be Bernie Sanders. If Tuesday brings another Biden rout, Sanders should withdraw and start fulfilling his pledge to defeat Donald Trump. That change would be revolution enough.

Texto completo: Like other commercial fishermen along the east and west coasts, Ethan Wallace had been waiting 18 months for China - the world's largest importer of live lobster - to lift its crushing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. seafood that had whittled down his profits.
This week, that moment came: Beijing started allowing Chinese businesses to apply for tariff exemptions. But for Wallace, it no longer mattered.
Tariffs or not, no one in China is buying. The coronavirus outbreak meant the Lunar New Year banquets and wedding parties that feature a fresh lobster on every plate, a symbol of good fortune, were canceled. In several cities, restaurants are shuttered and public indoor gatherings are prohibited. And even if they weren't, many of the planes that ferry live lobsters aren't flying to China.
"Boom! Coronavirus," said Wallace, 28, after he had steered Piece of the Pie, his 43-foot Torres boat, into the Keys Fisheries marina in Marathon, Florida. Although the season continues through the end of March, he and his crew that day took home more lobster traps than pounds of lobster from the Gulf of Mexico.
"Normally I would still be out there fishing for the next 15 days or so," he said as two mates unloaded wooden traps laced with brown garlands of seaweed that hung like tinsel. Even though the catch trails off near the end of the season, the premium price that buyers are willing to pay for live lobsters that can be shipped to China - $11 to $12 a pound when the year started - was worth the effort.
In January, when the Chinese government closed the live-seafood market in Wuhan, the price of lobster in Florida fell overnight by as much as $5 a pound. Because they will now have to be sold for frozen use, the lobsters aren't worth as much.
"To not catch very much and have no price, it's hard to leave your gear out," said Wallace, who had already beached most of his 3,200 lobster traps. Between fuel and wages for his crew, a day of lobstering can cost him more than $1,000. "Once they dropped the price down, everybody made a beeline for the dock."
All around the wharf, spilling over into the parking lot, on the grass and even in some spots along the Overseas Highway that traverses the Florida Keys, lobster traps are stacked.
The makeshift skyline of slatted wooden low-rises and high-rises is one emblem of how far and fast the coronavirus outbreak is reverberating throughout the global economy. Production and distribution chains, travel plans and social gatherings have been disrupted in Asia, Europe and North America. The effects are rippling out to the supply of Apple phones and demand for hotel rooms and lobsters.
"The effect of the coronavirus has been a shake-up across the entire lobster supply chain in the U.S. and Canada," said Annie Tselikis, executive director of the Lobster Dealers' Association in Maine, where 4 out of 5 U.S. lobsters are caught.
Now is a slow time for fishing and sales in the state, she said, so the damage has been limited.
Compared with Maine, the annual landings from the Florida Keys are tiny: about 6 million pounds. But half the catch goes to China, the largest single customer.
Over the past decade, China's demand for live lobster - a sign of wealth and status among the country's rapidly growing middle class - has transformed Florida's lobster industry. The clawless spiny Caribbean lobsters caught off its coast tend to be more prized in China than Maine's pincered ones.
Known as dragon shrimp, they could be shipped out of Miami and arrive - alive - in China 40 hours later. As prices headed past $20 a pound in 2014, more and more fishing boats, processors and buyers redirected their operations to sell to Asia. Lobster is now the most valuable seafood product harvested in the state.
"The Chinese market has upped the quality of our life," said Ernie Piton, 55, who was repairing traps outside his garage. He, too, ended his season early. About 10 years ago, he switched to selling live lobsters directly to Chinese buyers who waited on the dock in Key Largo for his boat and then picked through lobsters as they were unloaded. "We've been able to put more money in the bank," Piton said.
D&D Seafood, which handles more than 1 million pounds of lobster a year, has a facility five minutes from Miami International Airport to speed shipments. "The virus has knocked out 100% of our live business to China," said Dennis Dopico, the vice president. When the market shut, he got stuck with about 5,000 pounds in the tanks instead of the 15,000 carried on an average day. "We just got lucky," he said.
For Florida's fishing industry, the health scare is the latest in a series of unfortunate events. In 2017, Hurricane Irma ripped through the region, wrecking lobster traps and boats and reducing the commercial fishing harvests, said Gary Graves, manager of Keys Fisheries, one of the state's largest seafood processors and distributors.
In 2018, a trade feud with the United States prompted China to impose an additional 25% tariff on U.S. lobster imports - payback for tariffs that the Trump administration had slapped on Chinese goods.
Last summer, just after lobster season started, another wave of tariffs from the White House prompted the Chinese to retaliate by further raising import duties on U.S. seafood. Exports of live lobster to China plunged 42% from 2018 to 2019, from $148 million to less than $86 million, according to Maine International Trade Center.
Maine was hit the hardest by the punitive tariffs. Buyers could easily pivot north to Canada, whose waters breed the same species of clawed lobster.
Sixteen hundred miles south, in the Keys, anglers and distributors still sold live lobsters to China, but prices were down. "The tariffs cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars," said Piton, the Key Largo fisherman. He had hoped to make up some lost ground during new year celebrations in China, when pumped-up demand raised prices. "You hope for a good pull right at the end of the season," he said. "Then the market crashed."
Piton lives down the block from Key Largo Fisheries. Last week, a lone lobster boat, Hanna Katherine, arrived with something to sell.
Stepping off the deck, John Greco said he had already taken out about one-third of his 2,600 traps but figured he could earn some extra money since most everyone else had given up for the season. "It sucks that the price dropped," he said as a couple of lobsters scrambled out of the bright blue crates that had been hoisted onto the dock. "But if you don't go out, you don't make anything."
Greco, 34, and his brother have been trapping lobsters since high school. That morning they had motored out at 5:30 a.m., pulling up and emptying about 250 traps throughout the day.
Inside the fishery, a half-dozen cutters in white rubber boots and thick gloves wielded long fillet knives, quickly dissevering tubs of yellowtail. Heads went in one plastic-lined cardboard box, skeletons that could be used for chum in another. Nearby, a purple tub was crowded with bonito, often used as bait. "It has a scent to it that fish just adore," said Rick Hill, a co-owner of Key Largo Fisheries.
The lobsters were weighed in batches and then dumped into a stainless-steel vat filled with ice and freshwater, a quick way to kill them. Some would probably end up in one of the fishery's enormous warehouse freezers that are set at 20 and 30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
The final tally: 365 pounds of lobster, worth just over $2,500.
"I'm not complaining," Greco said, but noted that if the Chinese market hadn't collapsed, he would have earned at least another $1,000 for the day's labor.
For the U.S. commercial fishing industry, the tariff exemption is a huge relief, but because of the virus, it is still unclear how long it will take to revive trade with China.
In Marathon, the season is winding down, but it reopens in August. "Next year's right around the corner for us," Wallace said.

Back in her COMFORT ZONE For Mikaela Shiffrin, a double Olympic gold medal winner, getting on the slopes was what she needed to deal with the sudden death of her father

Texto completo: ARE, Sweden - The course was steep, treacherously so, and the snow beneath Mikaela Shiffrin's skis had the consistency of sliced bread left uncovered all morning. It called to mind the hard and crusty conditions she was exposed to as a child in Vermont and New Hampshire rather than the pillowy foam stuff she skied on, when she skied at all, during her recent month-and-a-half hiatus from competition.
Shiffrin, a double Olympic gold medalist, traveled to this Scandinavian Alpine skiing oasis this week for the first races of the rest of her career after the Feb. 2 death of her father, Jeff, from a head injury after an accident at the family's Colorado home.
The Swedish Alpine National Arena was the site, during the 2012-13 season, of the first of Shiffrin's 66 World Cup victories. But Tuesday, two days before the scheduled start of this week's Women's World Cup season finale, she said she felt "really nothing but fear" during her first two trips down the mountain.
"It was the most intimidated I've ever felt, I think," said Shiffrin, who admitted she had considered stopping.
No one outside her small coaching team was watching. No race clock was running. No one would have been the wiser had Shiffrin removed her skis and called it a day, called it a season. But the goal of making a few good turns, the best way she could think to honor her father, kept her going.
So she made five more runs and by the seventh, Shiffrin felt redeemed. Reborn. She had made a few good turns and then some.
"It was probably the biggest, most successful day that I've had so far, maybe in my career," Shiffrin said.
She added, "I started out the day feeling really nothing but fear and ended up the day feeling maybe a healthy dose of that awareness but feeling the passion and the love and the excitement for it again."
Without stepping in the start gate, Shiffrin had accomplished what she had traveled more than 4,000 miles to do. So she accepted with equanimity the news, on Wednesday - less than 22 hours before the start of Thursday's parallel slalom - that the competition had been canceled in the cascading fallout from the deadly spread of the coronavirus.
With next week's World Cup finals in Italy already called off, the scrapping of this week's competition delivered the overall World Cup title to the Italian Federica Brignone, ending the three-year reign of Shiffrin, who lost her 370-point lead in the weeks after she lost her 65-year-old father.
Shiffrin, who will turn 25 on Friday, could see the sublimity in the situation. Her father had always emphasized form over results. And here she sat, with no choice but to return to Colorado content to do the same.
"If nothing else, I'm grateful that we came this far, even with the races canceled," Shiffrin said. "So I got to get out there for that training session with full intentions of preparing for a race and skied with that intensity. I accomplished that, and that was all I had set out to do."
"It was maybe in the long term even better that I didn't step into the start gate and have to deal with the mental challenges of knowing that the overall title was still in the cards," she added, "because the competitor in me probably would have come out and said, 'I care about the results,' even though that was never my focus."
Shiffrin spoke by telephone in an interview that took place with both subject and reporter stuck indoors only a few hundred yards apart, comfortably beyond the social distancing guideline of 6 feet suggested by health officials. The last headache Shiffrin needed was to develop coronavirus symptoms and face a quarantine. To be safe, she said, she was keeping everybody - reporters, friends and competitors alike - at a physical remove.
"I came here loaded with my bleach bottle and hand wipes and stopped just short of spraying people in the face if they got too close to me," she said with a laugh.
The coronavirus threat didn't keep friends and competitors from trying to wrap Shiffrin in welcome-back hugs. On Wednesday night, on their way out of town, two of Shiffrin's U.S. teammates, Paula Moltzan and Nina O'Brien, stopped by to deliver an early birthday present: a basket containing 25 individually wrapped gifts. Shiffrin gave them foot bumps in lieu of an embrace, and then repeated to them what she has told everyone else in recent days: "I am leaning on you guys, just not to the point of physical contact."
Shiffrin had spent most of Wednesday, a designated day off from training, poring over her sponsor contracts. Outside, snow fell as softly as confetti all morning, conditions that would have delighted her father, she said. "I feel like he sort of lives in the snowflakes that fall," she said. But that was not why he was very much on her mind.
"Up to this point, my dad was the one who would read over my contracts," said Shiffrin, who was making notes about one of them when she received the text from event organizers informing her that her longest season was officially over.
"I was really looking forward to these races, if nothing else because it's been a place to put my mind and my energy for the last couple of weeks," Shiffrin said. "A place to focus but also a distraction."
The hardest step in mourning is that first one that takes you out of the house and out to face the world again. So whatever Shiffrin lost by not being able to race three times this week, she recognized that she gained infinitely more.
"This last week," she said, "has been really monumental in the whole grieving process."

Texto completo: A native of the Georgia coast, Taylor Brown offers readers his fourth novel, "Pride of Eden," as an "environmentalism" tale of majestic animals that should be living in the wild, and the flawed characters who fight to save them from human exploitation.
Brown's work has appeared in The New York Times, The Rumpus, Garden & Gun, Chautauqua, The North Carolina Literary Review and many other publications.
He is the author of a short story collection, "In the Season of Blood and Gold," and each of his three previous novels: "Fallen Land, "The River of Kings" and "Gods of Howl Mountain" became a finalist for the Southern Book Prize. He has also captured the Montana Prize in Fiction.
An Eagle Scout who graduated from the University of Georgia in 2005, Brown has lived in Buenos Aires, San Francisco, and the mountains of western North Carolina. Today he makes his home in Savannah, Georgia.
"Pride of Eden" reveals environmental and moral lessons through a narrative that combines the heroism of its flawed characters with the tenderness and fury of the animals they work to save – and "an underworld of smugglers, gamblers, breeders, trophy hunters and others who exploit exotic game." It's also an original kind of story. Tell me how you formed the idea for this tale — you must be an enormous animal lover yourself!
Indeed, I've always been an animal lover, and animals have always found their way into my work – though more indirectly until now. A few years ago, I visited Carolina Tiger Rescue in Pittsboro, North Carolina – a big cat sanctuary that takes in tigers, lions, ocelots, servals, and other wild cats from all over the region. There's a story behind every denizen there, and most come from pretty bad conditions such as roadside zoos, negligent private owners, circuses, etc. Their stories really moved me, and I began to formulate the idea of someone who took the "rescue" part of an exotic wildlife rescue quite literally...
Main character Anse Caulfield is a retired racehorse jockey and Vietnam veteran who runs Little Eden, an exotic animal wildlife reserve off the Georgia coast. He lives to rescue elephants, big cats, rhinos, and other animals, to save them from a life lived in sideshows or as part of a hunter's "collection." What drove Anse to devote his life to this cause?
Anse has witnessed, and even been an accessory to, a lot of trauma visited on the animal kingdom, whether it was his experience in Vietnam, his time as a soldier of fortune in Africa, or his career as a quarter horse jockey. So, I think he's burdened with a lot of guilt and hoping to atone for some of those things in his past, whether they were his own sins or those of his fellow man. That said, he's a bit of an outlaw and curmudgeon at heart, and he doesn't always go about things in the most legal manner.
Author Ron Rash has called "Pride of Eden" a "visionary novel of scarred souls seeking redemption not only for themselves but, in their limited way, for us all." In what ways would you agree with this observation?
I do think the characters in this book are seeking redemption in their own way. Most of them are dealing with some trauma in their past that continues to haunt and pain them on a daily basis. One of the beautiful things about our species is that we often heal through helping others, be they our fellow humans or members of the animal kingdom.
I think these characters — Anse and Malaya especially – have witnessed things that make them question the "humane-ness" of humanity. By working to help these captive and abused animals, they're helping to redeem not only themselves, but their faith in humanity as a whole. On the other hand, they're certainly not saints – they're as flawed as anyone, and things don't always go according to plan.
In addition to the obvious flashes of your sizable imagination throughout "Pride of Eden," you add a dash of mystery. Is there any chance there will ever be a sequel to this story?
That mystery reminds me of the words of a writer friend of mine, Matthew Neill Null, who once said, "The lives of animals are mysterious, and mystery is the lifeblood of fiction." Those words continue to resonate with me, whether I'm watching the red-tailed hawk that hunts over our neighborhood or writing about the elephants and rhinos I visited in South Africa. I tried to infuse that mystery into the novel.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some ideas percolating for a sequel to "Pride of Eden." Without giving anything away, I'm particularly interested in the story of wolf reintroduction in the American West, as well as the work of Animal Defenders International, who've been instrumental in rescuing animals from circuses in various countries of South America and bringing them to sanctuaries in the U.S. and South Africa.
Why is this a book that you believed needed to be written now?
Well, I think the clock is ticking for so many species. Scientists say we're living through the "Anthropocene Extinction," in which human activity is correlated with extinction rates hundreds of times higher than normal. It may well be the defining story of our epoch.
We're living in an age when there are about as many captive tigers in the state of Texas alone as left in the wild in the rest of the world, and in 2018, the last male northern white rhino died living under 24-hour armed guard. I can't imagine living in a world without such magnificent creatures. I think, if we're more intimate with the lives and stories of animals, we may be more likely to love, respect, and protect them – and in the process, save something crucial of our own hearts.
Signing
Taylor Brown will sign copies of "Pride of Eden" at 5 p.m. March 23 at Lemuria Books in Jackson.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

'Pride of Eden'

Texto completo: A native of the Georgia coast, Taylor Brown offers readers his fourth novel, "Pride of Eden," as an "environmentalism" tale of majestic animals that should be living in the wild, and the flawed characters who fight to save them from human exploitation.
Brown's work has appeared in The New York Times, The Rumpus, Garden & Gun, Chautauqua, The North Carolina Literary Review and many other publications.
He is the author of a short story collection, "In the Season of Blood and Gold," and each of his three previous novels: "Fallen Land, "The River of Kings" and "Gods of Howl Mountain" became a finalist for the Southern Book Prize. He has also captured the Montana Prize in Fiction.
An Eagle Scout who graduated from the University of Georgia in 2005, Brown has lived in Buenos Aires, San Francisco, and the mountains of western North Carolina. Today he makes his home in Savannah, Georgia.
"Pride of Eden" reveals environmental and moral lessons through a narrative that combines the heroism of its flawed characters with the tenderness and fury of the animals they work to save – and "an underworld of smugglers, gamblers, breeders, trophy hunters and others who exploit exotic game." It's also an original kind of story. Tell me how you formed the idea for this tale — you must be an enormous animal lover yourself!
Indeed, I've always been an animal lover, and animals have always found their way into my work – though more indirectly until now. A few years ago, I visited Carolina Tiger Rescue in Pittsboro, North Carolina – a big cat sanctuary that takes in tigers, lions, ocelots, servals, and other wild cats from all over the region. There's a story behind every denizen there, and most come from pretty bad conditions such as roadside zoos, negligent private owners, circuses, etc. Their stories really moved me, and I began to formulate the idea of someone who took the "rescue" part of an exotic wildlife rescue quite literally...
Main character Anse Caulfield is a retired racehorse jockey and Vietnam veteran who runs Little Eden, an exotic animal wildlife reserve off the Georgia coast. He lives to rescue elephants, big cats, rhinos, and other animals, to save them from a life lived in sideshows or as part of a hunter's "collection." What drove Anse to devote his life to this cause?
Anse has witnessed, and even been an accessory to, a lot of trauma visited on the animal kingdom, whether it was his experience in Vietnam, his time as a soldier of fortune in Africa, or his career as a quarter horse jockey. So, I think he's burdened with a lot of guilt and hoping to atone for some of those things in his past, whether they were his own sins or those of his fellow man. That said, he's a bit of an outlaw and curmudgeon at heart, and he doesn't always go about things in the most legal manner.
Author Ron Rash has called "Pride of Eden" a "visionary novel of scarred souls seeking redemption not only for themselves but, in their limited way, for us all." In what ways would you agree with this observation?
I do think the characters in this book are seeking redemption in their own way. Most of them are dealing with some trauma in their past that continues to haunt and pain them on a daily basis. One of the beautiful things about our species is that we often heal through helping others, be they our fellow humans or members of the animal kingdom.
I think these characters — Anse and Malaya especially – have witnessed things that make them question the "humane-ness" of humanity. By working to help these captive and abused animals, they're helping to redeem not only themselves, but their faith in humanity as a whole. On the other hand, they're certainly not saints – they're as flawed as anyone, and things don't always go according to plan.
In addition to the obvious flashes of your sizable imagination throughout "Pride of Eden," you add a dash of mystery. Is there any chance there will ever be a sequel to this story?
That mystery reminds me of the words of a writer friend of mine, Matthew Neill Null, who once said, "The lives of animals are mysterious, and mystery is the lifeblood of fiction." Those words continue to resonate with me, whether I'm watching the red-tailed hawk that hunts over our neighborhood or writing about the elephants and rhinos I visited in South Africa. I tried to infuse that mystery into the novel.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some ideas percolating for a sequel to "Pride of Eden." Without giving anything away, I'm particularly interested in the story of wolf reintroduction in the American West, as well as the work of Animal Defenders International, who've been instrumental in rescuing animals from circuses in various countries of South America and bringing them to sanctuaries in the U.S. and South Africa.
Why is this a book that you believed needed to be written now?
Well, I think the clock is ticking for so many species. Scientists say we're living through the "Anthropocene Extinction," in which human activity is correlated with extinction rates hundreds of times higher than normal. It may well be the defining story of our epoch.
We're living in an age when there are about as many captive tigers in the state of Texas alone as left in the wild in the rest of the world, and in 2018, the last male northern white rhino died living under 24-hour armed guard. I can't imagine living in a world without such magnificent creatures. I think, if we're more intimate with the lives and stories of animals, we may be more likely to love, respect, and protect them – and in the process, save something crucial of our own hearts.
Signing
Taylor Brown will sign copies of "Pride of Eden" at 5 p.m. March 23 at Lemuria Books in Jackson.

Texto completo: Andrea Cummings is facing so far the biggest threat to her young small business, and there's not much she can do about it.
She and her husband, Ryan Cummings, opened DreiBerge Coffee in Des Moines' Historic East Village last summer, joining a shopping district chock-full of small businesses, boutiques and restaurants.
But Cummings has begun to see the effects of the novel coronavirus, the illness that's killed thousands worldwide, halted sporting events, canceled schools and forced quarantines during its spread across the globe.
Compared to last month, DreiBerge has seen a 25% dip in sales, Cummings said. She thinks people are staying away because they don't want to get sick.
If they're losing revenue, Des Moines businesses could find it harder to pay their bills, and employees who depend on that income. Some of those hourly workers will continue to go to work in the midst of the outbreak, but loss of sales could mean loss of pay.
"It's definitely impacting us I think faster than what we anticipated," Cummings said.
The coffee shop will remain open, but Cummings announced it would take a slew of precautions. Customers can no longer fill their personal reusable cups, and DreiBerge won't serve anything in their usual mugs or on their usual plates, opting for recyclable cups and take-home containers.
Surfaces will be sanitized frequently, and the tables will be rearranged so people sit farther away from each other. The children's play area is closed indefinitely. Across town, Horizon Line Coffee opted for similar measures.
Cummings doesn't see things getting back to normal for another six to eight weeks.
"We're starting to ask the question: If we do have to cut hours, how do we do that?" she said.
Working (or not) during pandemic Lynsi Baker, an in-home daycare provider in Des Moines, said COVID-19 will have a "butterfly effect" if parents aren't able to work because many of them work jobs they can't do at home.
"They don't have a job, I don't have a job," she said.
Speaking to the Register on Thursday, Baker said she usually closes when area schools cancel classes — most often due to weather.
Later Thursday afternoon, Des Moines Public Schools announced it would be closed for two weeks, including spring break, and planned to reopen March 30.
As of Friday afternoon, Iowa had 17 positive cases of coronavirus.
The virus can present problems on two fronts for small businesses, the New York Times reported. Customers can be hesitant to visit out of fear of getting sick, and business staff could be unable to work because they're sick or quarantined.
That can be lethal to local shops that don't operate on wide profit margins, according to the newspaper.
Baker imagined eight to 10 parents would take their kids out of her daycare if they can't work. She was already working to make sure her kids and their surroundings were ultra-clean, noting that both daycare providers and parents alike were "on edge."
If employees are sick, they shouldn't come to work, said Jeff Bruning, owner of Full Court Press, which owns popular area restaurants like Fong's Pizza, el Bait Shop, the Royal Mile and Hessen Haus.
"That's always a thing," he said. "So this is just another version of that to me."
He said his staff is "staying vigilant" and emphasizing cleanliness while also not trying to make the illness overblown.
'Bills don't care' Bruning noted that paid time off is rare in the service industry, something chef and Uber driver Scott Robinson knows all too well. Robinson, of Altoona, plans to keep driving for Uber, his primary source of income, even in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.
"Bills don't care about that," he said.
Robinson, also a full-time student at Des Moines Area Community College, actually saw a small uptick in rides on Thursday morning. He theorized it's because people wanted to avoid public transportation.
He'll keep his disinfectant spray handy, cleaning out his car every three or four rides. He was clean to begin with — drivers are rated, after all — so it won't be a huge change for him.
In Beaverdale, Hunter Gillum, the manager at Beaverdale Books, said he and the staff have been disinfecting the front counter regularly. He's yet to see a trickle-down effect of the outbreak but expects business to slow down in the coming days.
He hopes it only lasts a few weeks.
"You just kind of have to wait and see," he said.
Watching personal spending Gillum said most of his six employees are retirees who don't wholly depend on what they make at the bookstore. It's a different story at DreiBerge.
While several of Cummings' seven employees use their income as "fun" money, others need it for the essentials. It'll be hard to determine who gets to work if the shop has to cut hours, Cummings said.
"That stresses me out more than anything," she said.
She even told her staff: Try to curtail any frivolous spending and save up during a trying time for the business.
The Greater Des Moines Partnership offered up tips for businesses as they try to navigate a suddenly harrowing landscape, including telling them to document their losses because a government disaster declaration could make financial help available.
Meanwhile, Cummings is trying to think of other creative ways to keep the business going, while encouraging online shopping. One thing would make the biggest difference, though: customers.
"That's how we survive seasons like this," she said.

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. 'My Dark Vanessa' by Kate Elizabeth Russell (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: When she was 15, Vanessa had a sexual relationship with her 42-year-old English teacher. At the time, she was thrilled by what she thought was a consensual romance. Years later, that same teacher is accused of sexual abuse by a former student. Does Vanessa remain silent and hold on to that illusion, or does she face the ugly truth of her first love?
The buzz: "Russell offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement..." says a review in Publishers Weekly.
2. 'The Mirror & the Light' by Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt & Co., fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The final book in Mantel's historical trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell in the court of King Henry VIII.
The buzz: The publisher has kept a tight lid on this one, but the early reviews are rapturous. "With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of," says a review in The Guardian.
3. 'MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman' by Ben Hubbard (Tim Duggan Books, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The Beirut bureau chief for the New York Times paints a gripping portrait of the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, the mysterious and powerful young Saudi Arabian prince who ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The buzz: "A chilling look at the ascent of the current young prince of Saudi Arabia to first-in-line to succession," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
4. 'A Good Neighborhood' by Therese Anne Fowler's (St. Martin's Press, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: Two families are at odds in the tight-knit North Carolina community of Oak Knoll. Valerie Alston-Hold, a black professor with a musically gifted, biracial son, objects when her neighbors, the nouveau riche white family, the Whitmans, raze the lot next door to build a showplace. Then their teenagers fall in love.
The buzz: "A riveting, potentially redemptive story of modern American suburbia that reads almost like an ancient Greek tragedy," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
5. 'Recollections of My Nonexistence' by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: A portrait of the artist as a young woman. In her new memoir, Solnit reflects on her growth as a writer, feminist and activist in 1980s San Francisco, and on finding her voice in a society that prefers women to pipe down.
The buzz: A starred review in Kirkus Reviews calls it "a perceptive, radiant portrait of a writer of indelible consequence."

Virus test drive-thrus pop up in Detroit area

Texto completo: Drive-thru coronavirus testing centers are popping up in Michigan as hospitals aim to keep those afflicted with the virus from entering the ER and exposing other sick patients and medical staff to the infectious disease that has changed modern life as we know it.
Schools and universities shut down. Sporting events canceled. Disney World closed.
But the hospitals are open — and they're taking some unique measures to keep everyone inside safe.
Drive-thru and curbside testing sites surfaced at hospitals over the weekend, including at Beaumont hospitals in Royal Oak, Dearborn, Farmington Hills and Troy. Hospitals are seeking to help those who fear they may have the virus, test them if they show signs of illness, and keep them out of hospitals where they could make matters worse.
"Unless you're seriously ill, you shouldn't be in a hospital," said Dr. James Larkin, director of emergency medicine at McLaren Macomb, which set up an outdoor coronavirus screening tent on Saturday in Mount Clemens.
However, the drive-thru testing unit for COVID-19 is only for people who have shown some type of symptoms, Larkin stressed.
The Mount Clemens COVID-19 drive-thru is under a canopy outside the McLaren Macomb emergency room, where patients can stay in their cars and get treated through the window by staff in protective gear. Vitals are taken first and a series of questions are asked before doctors determine whether a nasal swab should be given, or whether to have the person be admitted to the ER. It is open 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
If a nasal swab is taken, typical turnaround from the state lab is about 1-3 days.
"We are providing the same screening, only in an ambulatory setting so that we don't have patients come back and expose other patients and staff," Larkin said. "We're trying to isolate people who may have the virus from our general population so they don't spread it."
Larkin stressed that it's crucial for people with minor symptoms to stay home.
"If you have a 103 fever and you're coughing and you don't feel well, coming to the emergency isn't going to do anything," Larkin said. "Stay home and self-isolate. We don't really need to see those people."
Larkin noted that only critically ill people with severe breathing problems, such as their lungs are shutting down, can be helped in a hospital, where they can be put on supplemental oxygen or a breathing machine while they fight the virus. But only those very severe cases can be helped in a hospital setting.
"There is no treatment for this virus, there is nothing you can do," Larkin said. "People come and think they can do something. The reality is — we can't. ... Stay at home, take Motrin. Tylenol. Get fluids and rest and try not to expose other people."
To date, COVID-19 has afflicted more than 156,000 people worldwide. More than 5,800 have died; another 72,600 have recovered.
Beaumont hospitals in Royal Oak, Dearborn, Farmington Hills, Troy are also offering limited curbside screening and evaluation for COVID-19. The screening is only for patients who have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath.
If Beaumont medical staff determine a patient needs to be tested, a specimen will be collected and sent to a lab for testing. The hospital system urges the public to call ahead to Beaumont's COVID-19 hotline, or their doctor's office, before attempting to get screened.
"We are offering this limited screening option to help reduce the spread of the virus," said Dr. Nick Gilpin, Beaumont Health's medical director of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology.
Gilpin offered the following recommendations for people who develop COVID-19:
Stay home
Drink lots of fluids
Get plenty of rest and take over-the-counter medications, such as pain relievers.
Talk to your provider before seeking treatment at a hospital or other health care facility.
Older adults with underlying health concerns or those with a compromised immune system who suspect they might be experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact their physician.
Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids also opened a drive-up coronavirus testing center on Saturday —but it's by appointment only and you need a doctor's order to be tested.
"This site is for patients with appointments only. It is not a drive-up site for screening, testing or on-demand specimen collection," Spectrum Health said in a statement Saturday.
Patients who have been pre-approved for the screening can drive up, stay in their car and professionals wearing protective gear will administer the test while they stay in their vehicles.
The Western Michigan hospital system stressed that testing center will collect specimens "only from individuals who have a physician's order."
"During this public health incident, our chief concern is to make sure we are taking care of the community and preventing the spread of COVID-19," Spectrum Health states, adding the drive-up's goal is to enable "fast, efficient and safe collection for testing at the state lab."
The Henry Ford Health system said on Saturday that it, too, has tents set up at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital in Wyandotte and Henry Ford Allegiance in Jackson for triaging for potential patient overflow. Henry Ford Macomb and Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital are expected to get tents in the next few days.
As of Saturday afternoon, at least 2,345 people in 49 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have tested positive for novel coronavirus in the United States, according to a New York Times database, and at least 50 patients with the virus have died. The outbreak is now a pandemic, with 156,095 cases confirmed worldwide and 5,819 deaths and 72,619 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Meanwhile, the hospitals are aggressively working to prevent the spread of the virus, give people peace of mind, or medical help if they need it, and keep those on the front lines safe so they can help sick people.
The drive-thru tents surfaced less than 24 hours after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned all visitations to hospitals, nursing homes and health care facilities, except for "exigent circumstances," such as grave illness or imminent death of a family member.
"We are working aggressively to implement the Governor's visitor restriction measures, beginning with our highest risk areas — those being our acute care hospitals," Henry Ford Health Systems said in a statement. "We remain committed to taking the right steps to protect our patients, employees and our communities and reduce the spread of this disease."

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. 'My Dark Vanessa' by Kate Elizabeth Russell (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: When she was 15, Vanessa had a sexual relationship with her 42-year-old English teacher. At the time, she was thrilled by what she thought was a consensual romance. Years later, that same teacher is accused of sexual abuse by a former student. Does Vanessa remain silent and hold on to that illusion, or does she face the ugly truth of her first love?
The buzz: "Russell offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement..." says a review in Publishers Weekly.
2. 'The Mirror & the Light' by Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt & Co., fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The final book in Mantel's historical trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell in the court of King Henry VIII.
The buzz: The publisher has kept a tight lid on this one, but the early reviews are rapturous. "With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of," says a review in The Guardian.
3. 'MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman' by Ben Hubbard (Tim Duggan Books, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The Beirut bureau chief for the New York Times paints a gripping portrait of the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, the mysterious and powerful young Saudi Arabian prince who ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The buzz: "A chilling look at the ascent of the current young prince of Saudi Arabia to first-in-line to succession," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
4. 'A Good Neighborhood' by Therese Anne Fowler's (St. Martin's Press, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: Two families are at odds in the tight-knit North Carolina community of Oak Knoll. Valerie Alston-Hold, a black professor with a musically gifted, biracial son, objects when her neighbors, the nouveau riche white family, the Whitmans, raze the lot next door to build a showplace. Then their teenagers fall in love.
The buzz: "A riveting, potentially redemptive story of modern American suburbia that reads almost like an ancient Greek tragedy," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
5. 'Recollections of My Nonexistence' by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: A portrait of the artist as a young woman. In her new memoir, Solnit reflects on her growth as a writer, feminist and activist in 1980s San Francisco, and on finding her voice in a society that prefers women to pipe down.
The buzz: A starred review in Kirkus Reviews calls it "a perceptive, radiant portrait of a writer of indelible consequence."

Texto completo: SHANGHAI - China is starting to get back to work. More than six weeks after its leaders virtually shut down the world's second-largest economy to stop a relentless coronavirus outbreak, factories are reopening and offices are starting to fill.
That's little solace to Zhang Xu. Piles of windshields - some broken, others new and ready to be installed - sit untouched at his car repair shop in a blue-collar neighborhood in Shanghai. One of his two employees is still stuck in a faraway village. But that matters little, because Zhang has no customers.
"If we don't get sales, the distributor won't be able to order more from the factory and the factory won't be able to produce," Zhang said.
Stopping the Chinese industrial machine was painful for China and for the world - and restarting it may be even harder. Factories are well short of full capacity. Even the most successfully restarted cities are only halfway back. Tens of millions of laborers cannot get to work. Even when workers come back, Chinese businesses may find overseas demand slumping for their exports because of worsening coronavirus epidemics in other countries.
China's difficulties could hold lessons for other countries looking for answers to the outbreak. Looking for a way to slow the virus without sinking the economy, the United States on Wednesday blocked travelers from Europe, and President Donald Trump has said he wants to get consumers spending more. The Italian government imposed travel restrictions Monday on the entire country. Other places, like South Korea, have intensified testing and monitoring without trying to shut down their industrial engines.
Unquestionably, China has made progress starting up again. As supply chains in the West began to run dry, airfreight rates from China jumped suddenly last week, according to TAC Index, an air cargo pricing data company in Hong Kong.
"They need to be refilled now," said John Peyton Burnett, the company's managing director.
But factories in China are running at 50% to 60% of capacity, he said, and other measures show even less activity in many places.
Beijing has unleashed a series of measures to get offices and factories humming again. Bankers describe almost daily phone calls from regulators, telling them to show leniency on debt repayments, particularly from smaller businesses. Insurers have been told to extend policies even when premiums are not paid on time.
The state-owned railway has halved a wide range of freight charges. The national Education Ministry has created 180,000 spaces at graduate schools next autumn for students graduating this spring with little prospect of a job. Shanghai alone says it has helped residents and businesses with more than $15 billion in loans and other credit assistance, mainly from the state-controlled banking sector.
Those measures face formidable hurdles. Local officials are under pressure to reduce new infections, making them nervous about allowing people to return to work.
Cash-strapped families may also be reluctant to spend. Household and corporate debts are huge after a decade of heavy lending by the state-controlled banking sector. Workers do not know whether their employers can pay them. Businesses do not know if other businesses will default on payments for goods and services.
More than 50 million migrant workers have not yet returned to their jobs, according to official data. Some remain in quarantine. Others are stranded in rural areas where bus service has not resumed. Many are not yet needed by employers.
Factory owners face still one more problem: slowing global demand for the goods China makes. The coronavirus outbreak is threatening global growth, which could slow factories just as they restart. "If the demand shock is not addressed fast, then it could become a problem," said Cao Heping, a Peking University economist.

Taking a look at 'active surveillance' Not to be confused with 'watchful waiting,' this routine-monitoring approach could reduce need for radical treatment of prostate cancer

Texto completo: Howard Wolinsky is a medical journalist in Flossmoor, Illinois, who knows better than to go forward with potentially life-changing surgery without first seeking a second opinion.
Nine years ago, at age 63, when a PSA blood test followed by a biopsy revealed cancer in Wolinsky's prostate gland, the diagnosing urologist said he could operate to remove the offending organ the following week.
Not so fast, Wolinsky thought, knowing this was not a minor operation and one that often left men temporarily or permanently impotent, incontinent or both. So before having surgery Wolinsky consulted Dr. Scott Eggener, a University of Chicago urologist, who reviewed the test results and proposed an alternative strategy called "active surveillance."
Not to be confused with "watchful waiting," active surveillance is not a do-nothing approach. Rather, patients are routinely monitored and referred for surgery or radiation therapy only if their cancer begins to grow or show molecular signs of aggression.
Current estimates are that about half of men found to have prostate cancer could avoid radical treatment and its potential side effects if they were willing to live with having a cancer, albeit a seemingly benign one, in their bodies.
These are men whose cancer is deemed, based on its biological characteristics, to be low risk in terms of progressing to a potentially life-threatening state.
Only if periodic exams reveal that a man's cancer is shown to be progressing to a more aggressive state would more radical treatment be considered. For men who choose active surveillance, Eggener said, this generally affects about 5% annually for the first five to 10 years.
Other reasons for abandoning active surveillance and undergoing radical treatment include the patients' growing anxiety about living with cancer and pressure from family members, and sometimes even from their doctors to "get it out," clinicians report.
Watchful waiting, which involves little or no monitoring, is still sometimes suggested but mainly reserved for men with a limited life expectancy for other reasons or those whose health status makes surgery inadvisable.
Based on his PSA of less than 4 and a Gleason score of 6, Wolinsky said, "Dr. Eggener told me, 'You're the perfect candidate - the poster child for active surveillance.' "
The Gleason score is a measure of the cancer's aggressiveness, and a composite score of less than 7 is generally deemed low-risk disease.
So starting in 2010, Wolinsky had a PSA test and digital rectal exam every six months and an annual biopsy of the prostate, which was eventually lengthened to every three years. It's now been four years since the last biopsy, and chances are, unless a worrisome rise in the PSA occurs and other tests indicate an aggressive cancer, he may never need another.
Given the now rapidly changing methods of monitoring and diagnosing the lethality of prostate cancer, it behooves every man told he has cancer in this gland to explore the most currently available management options before deciding on treatment. There are now even support groups to help reassure men with a low-risk cancer who choose active surveillance.
"The field is on fire," said Dr. Laurence Klotz, a leading expert on urological cancer and pioneer of active surveillance.
"Within a few years, we'll have urine and blood tests that are so reliable we'll know which men don't even need a biopsy. Instead of a biopsy, there are now at least five biomarkers and more being developed that can be used as an initial test."
Even the process of biopsy has changed.
For decades, when a possible cancer was suspected based on the PSA test or digital rectal exam, doctors blindly took 12 core samples from the prostate to search for a malignancy. Now an MRI can be done first and a biopsy performed only if and when a potentially serious lesion is revealed. High-resolution ultrasound may even become a simpler and less expensive alternative to an MRI, Klotz said.
To avoid the need for a biopsy, Klotz is leading a large Canadian clinical trial, called Precise, to determine if an MRI is sufficiently accurate in detecting dangerous cancers and distinguishing them from harmless ones. He estimates, based on early data, that as many as 250,000 men a year in Canada and the United States could avoid unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to identify clinically significant cancers.
This approach results in the diagnosis of many fewer indolent cancers that would most likely never threaten a man's life, said Klotz, a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto.
"With an MRI, we find fewer of these low-grade cancers, and fewer men will be overtreated," he said.
If Eggener had his way, he would not even call it cancer for men with a Gleason score of 6 or lower because "it fails to meet the clinical definition of cancer: the ability to cause symptoms, metastasize or lead to death," he wrote in an email. "Removing the cancer label has been done in other cancers, most notably a subtype of thyroid and bladder cancers. I predict this will eventually happen for Gleason 6 prostate cancer and be reason for celebration."

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: For an indication of how much international corporations operating in South Carolina are being impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, let's look at the coast — more specifically, the ports.
South Carolina ports — where ships drop off and carry out cargo for large manufacturing businesses like BMW, Michelin and hundreds of others — handled a record volume of containers in February.
But now with the virus sweeping across the globe, coughing up mass quarantines and travel bans, port officials say that has dropped off significantly.
"While the coronavirus has not impacted our operations, we are beginning to see impacts on March volumes from when many plant workers were quarantined," S.C. Ports Authority President and CEO Jim Newsome said in a statement. "We anticipate that our container volumes will be down about 15-20% in March and April."
The Upstate is home to 500 international companies, representing 39 countries. Each of them rely on the ability to move goods and people across the world.
Shipments of goods are down, according to port officials. And Wednesday night, President Donald Trump imposed a travel ban on Europe.
To date, the virus has killed more than 4,300 people around the world, with the largest concentration of cases found in Asia and Europe.
In the U.S., at least 1,422 people in 45 states and Washington, D.C., have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a New York Times database. At least 38 patients with the virus have died.
In South Carolina, there have been six confirmed cases and six presumptive cases, including one in Spartanburg.
With all that's happening, there are going to be impacts on the many manufacturing businesses that call the Upstate of South Carolina home, said John Lummus, president and CEO of the Upstate SC Alliance, a public/private regional economic development organization that markets and promotes the northwestern corner of South Carolina.
"It stands to reason that disruptions to travel and gatherings will have economic impacts," Lummus said in an email. "The extent of those impacts remains to be seen."
According to a survey conducted recently by the National Association of Manufacturers, 78% of manufacturers across the U.S. anticipate the coronavirus having a financial impact.
In that same survey, which generated responses from 558 businesses and wrapped up on March 9, 53% said they anticipate the coronavirus resulting in a change in operations.
Only 35.5% reported that they are currently facing supply chain disruptions.
"Already, manufacturers are grappling with disruptions to their businesses due to the COVID-19 outbreak, with many anticipating financial and operational consequences — even before some of the developments of this week," NAM president and CEO Jay Timmons said in the report.
Germany-based BMW, which has a plant in Greer that employs more than 9,000 people, did not provide a comment about how well it's handling the coronavirus or how it's being impacted by the Europe travel ban.
France-based Michelin, which employs 22,700 at its North America plant in Greenville, did not respond either.
That plant is located near the Inland Port in Greer. A manager there referred reporter questions to the state port agency.
As for shipments coming into the state, port officials are optimistic that things will return to normal soon.
S.C. Ports moved 197,214 20-foot equivalent container units across the Wando Welch and North Charleston container terminals in February. The S.C. Port Authority has handled nearly 1.64 million containers thus far in fiscal year 2020, from July through February, a 4% increase from the same time a year ago.
A big reason for the slow down lately is that more than half of these shipments travel to and from either North Europe or Northeast Asia, areas hit hardest by the coronavirus to date.
But Newsome, with the S.C. Ports Authority, said it is promising that many companies and ocean carriers are reporting a return to normalcy as workers resume operations in China and other countries.
"We anticipate a rebound in volumes in May and June to finish the year," he said, "barring any unforeseen worsening of the situation."

Signing SB 1070 wasn't easy, and I have regrets

Texto completo: Ten years have passed since the signing of Senate Bill 1070. Ten years since the crisis facing Arizona became the crisis facing the whole nation.
As I look back on SB 1070, I wish it had never become the spectacle that it became. Unfortunately, the reaction to SB 1070, driven by publications like The New York Times, a then-antagonistic administration in Washington and the slew of protesters outside my office turned it into something it never needed to be.
Before we get to the discussion, though, I must first say that my biggest regret regarding SB 1070 is how it overshadowed the other incredible things we were able to accomplish during my time as governor of Arizona.
In 2009 when I was sworn in as the 22nd governor of Arizona, I inherited the most severe economic crisis that Arizona had ever seen. Not only did we weather the downturn, but we brought Arizona out of the financial crisis and put us on the path of prosperity.
As governor, I implemented a four cornerstone framework to revitalize Arizona: Economic competitiveness, education, state government and renewed federalism. I am proud of my team and our time for our massive successes in accomplishing all four of these cornerstones.
We saved more than 63,000 Arizonans, including 5,000 cancer patients in the middle of treatment, from being removed from Medicaid. Our efforts to restore and expand Medicaid help hundreds of thousands of citizens who were in desperate need of care. These efforts also eased the burden on our emergency rooms and addressed the 75% increase in uncompensated care that was being passed on to everyone in the form of the "hidden health-care tax."
We spurred incredible business sector growth by reorganizing the Arizona Department of Commerce and founding the Arizona Commerce Authority, bringing in multiple Fortune 500 companies and setting Arizona on the trajectory for immense future economic growth.
We also vetoed SB 1062, ruffling my friends on the right by ensuring Arizona couldn't use religious freedom as a means of discrimination against minority groups.
We protected Arizona's most vulnerable populations by revamping a broken child welfare system that was in complete disarray by establishing the Department of Child Safety, and ensuring quality care and resources are available for the seriously mentally ill by settling the 33-year-old lawsuit, Arnold v. Sarn.
That is why it frustrates me to no end that all of these accomplishments, along with many more, have been overshadowed by the circus that became the reaction and, often, the fiction of SB 1070.
When I think of the bill and the chaos surrounding that time, I'm reminded of something my mother always told me: "Doing the right thing almost always means doing the hard thing." I know that the only thing we can control in our lives is our own actions, and not the reactions of others.
The decision to amend and sign SB 1070 and pursue companion legislation, House Bill 2162, was a hard choice. The challenge facing immigration legislation to balance public safety concerns with humanitarian responsibility is a difficult tension that our country still struggles with today.
SB 1070 was in direct response to a real crisis. In 2010, the United States had lost operational control of the southwest border – that fact is what distinguishes today's discussions from the environment 10 years ago.
In December 2008, the U.S. Justice Department said that Mexican gangs are the "biggest organized crime threat to the United States." In 2009, Phoenix had 316 kidnapping cases, turning the city into our nation's kidnapping capital. Almost all the persons kidnapped were illegal immigrants or linked to the drug trade.
Narcotics prosecutions in Arizona had risen 202% in 16 months, and border apprehensions for Mexican nationals at the U.S.-Mexico border ranged from 800,639 in 2007 to 396,239 in 2010.
The same week I signed SB 1070, a major drug ring was broken up and Mexican cartel operatives suspected of running 40,000 pounds of marijuana through southern Arizona were indicted.
A week later, a local deputy sheriff was assaulted by suspected drug smugglers carrying an automatic weapon. The biggest insult, however, were signs posted by the federal government more than 80 miles from the border stating that Pinal County was an active smuggling area and Arizonans were encouraged to stay away.
There is no doubt that we were in an absolute crisis in 2010.
I did not cause the problem. It was caused by the lack of action by previous administrations – both Republican and Democrat. The federal government's failure to act had created a crisis that reached a tipping point in 2010 amid the severe economic recession that was gripping the country.
This was a crisis not merely because of the sheer volume of illegal immigrants crossing into Arizona and the problems that posed for public safety and economic competition. It was a humanitarian crisis concerning the dangerous way traffickers took advantage of vulnerable people (today, we call it human smuggling).
Border enforcement is not only about protecting America. It's about protecting vulnerable people from being dangerously trafficked to a life spent in, often times, deeper poverty and danger.
I made multiple requests to the Obama administration seeking help to enforce the rule of law along our southern border. I asked President Obama several times to personally visit the Arizona border – he never did. It was not until Secretary Jeh Johnson took over the Department of Homeland Security in 2013 that the Obama administration began to take the situation more seriously. Before that time, President Obama's initial reaction was to joke about the crisis and to characterize supporters of SB 1070 as racist. It was his reaction that ultimately led to the demagoguery of the issue by the media and the subsequent dialogue that has characterized the issue ever since. Simply put, the president didn't do his job, so we had to act to promote public safety and the rule of law. It's important to remember that I signed the bill only after insisting on language that was amended into the bill specifically guaranting that all United States citizens are treated equally under this law. It has been lost in the sands of time that we also insisted on Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board (AZ POST) training to protect against racial profiling. It's important to remember that the people calling us names were not the ones who had to comfort Robert Krentz's family after he was murdered on his own ranch by an undocumented immigrant.They were not the border patrol agents who, day after day, came across mountains of trash and decomposing corpses in the desert of those left to die by their heartless smugglers. I didn't sign SB 1070 because it was politically advantageous or because I didn't wish there was another way. I did it because it was my job, as governor, to do the right thing. Enforcing immigration laws that were already part of federal law was simply the only option we had left. SB 1070 was the hard choice, but it was absolutely the right choice. The federal government wasn't doing its job, and someone had to enforce the laws that were on the books. A failure to enforce some laws undermines the effectiveness of ALL laws. So, on the 10-year anniversary of SB 1070, I am proud to remember doing the right and hard thing. I am proud of leading Arizona in standing up to the dangerous threat of illegal immigration. All the while, we withstood national and local scrutiny by people who, quite frankly, didn't know what they were talking about (and probably still don't). I am proud of weathering the storm and still accomplishing great things for the state of Arizona, setting it up for the incredible prosperity it has since experienced.

Texto completo: People keep asking how to discern the difference between straight news reporting and opinion in "the media" amid the nation's turbid political maelstrom.
They keep posing such questions because the lines between the two genres have grown fuzzier due to the ever-growing array of social media organizations that refer to themselves as "media." You see them as IHateDemocrats.com and IHateRepublicans.com and such.
This "media-a-minute" explosion on the circuits of Facebook and its cousins is as perplexing to most of us as how to keep from getting the coronavirus.
Both "straight play" of the news and "opinion" fall occasionally into that discourse normally reserved for beauty "...in the eye of the beholder."
Anybody at anytime can believe someone or something is beautiful – or that it is "news" or "opinion." He or she can retain that belief no matter what the rest of humankind believes. Standards do exist, however.
This came up in a recent discussion on, quite naturally, the airwaves of Facebook when a learned man sincerely asked "... who is a talking head, a pundit, a commentator or an editor, but describes himself as a journalist?"
He continued, "Whom do you consider journalists? How do I determine the difference between journalism and opinion ... not taking sides, as I see it right and left, but asking."
I plunged ahead.
"Opinion should be marked as opinion," I said. "'Analysis' is mostly opinion. 'Perspective' is opinion. 'Context' is usually opinion. There is often a thin line between 'the news' and 'opinion.' In general, most newspaper reporters write unbiased stories, even though, being human, they obviously have opinions. If they aren't professional enough to play it straight they should be expelled.
"I know nothing of the electronic news world which nowadays seems almost all opinion all the time," I continued. "I don't mean 100%. Nothing is 100% except God's love (my view). Be wary of the social media world. It's full of crackpots posing as reporters and fake-news groups masquerading as The New York Times."
As a government PR guy, I had some trouble distinguishing between real reporters and fake ones and the outfits they represented. I finally decided to not issue credentials to anyone unaligned with a recognized media organization.
By "government PR guy," I meant my stint as the Mississippi House of Representatives' media liaison person from 1997-2009. When I took that post, almost zero marginally media outfits were operating locally. Later, the state Capitol was overrun with them and they all wanted a seat on Press Row.
They also wanted a desk in the Kenneth Toler Press Room on the building's third floor, which has an exquisite, elegant view of the whole place.
I was stubborn enough in that era to reject all candidates for Capitol press credentials, as I said, unless they were from a universally accepted media outfit, meaning, then, a known newspaper, television or radio group. My bosses backed me up on that.
I took that stance until several state newspapers pulled their Jackson correspondent to save money, making seats available on hallowed Press Row. Considering further cutbacks in reportage, I am assuming that those cushions today are largely filled by oft-unrecognizable "media" organizations.
If that's the situation in our state Capitol, imagine what it's like in the U.S. Capitol, where hundreds of humans and maybe a robot or two appear daily with loads of news-gathering accouterments. I'd hate to be that PR guy.

Freaking out about COVID-19 may help save lives

Texto completo: I got a call from a man who is concerned that I'm overreacting to the new coronavirus and spreading mass hysteria.
He was nice about it. But he was sincerely troubled that I've been writing columns urging elected officials and businesses to take increasingly drastic steps to fend off the spread of an illness that, in his view, isn't worse than anything else we've all lived through.
His perspective likely reflects the attitudes of a substantial percentage of Americans who are growing frustrated with the constant, intensifying media coverage of a situation that, in the course of a few days, escalated into draconian restrictions on public life, including everything from the indefinite cancellations and postponements of major sporting events to the closings of schools and the Indianapolis Public Library.
I understand where he's coming from. We've been thrust into a seemingly overnight societal transformation without any time to prepare for, or even understand, the consequences. It's reasonable for people to question news organizations' role in the nation's coronavirus response.
I can't speak for every editorial decision being made in America, but I want to explain why I'm freaking out about the COVID-19 outbreak – and why I think you should be, too.
Ignoring the coronavirus is selfish My thinking on the coronavirus has evolved rapidly. A little more than a week ago, I was in Florida attending a New York Yankees-Detroit Tigers spring training game and visiting a Disney attraction with my family. I knew the coronavirus was out there – there were already confirmed cases in Florida – but I wasn't very worried about it.
I'm still not worried from a personal standpoint. But I've come to think that personal risk is irrelevant to how we should react to COVID-19. The new coronavirus constitutes a severe public health crisis for at least two reasons: It can spread quickly, and it is highly lethal for older people.
The symptoms associated with the coronavirus are deceptively common. They include a sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. And, indeed, the symptoms can be so mild that people can be infected with the virus, while going about their daily lives, and spread it without realizing they even have it.
That doesn't seem terrible if you are 25 years old. The death rate for someone in their 20s or 30s is around 0.2%, according to one analysis from the Centers for Disease Control. But when the disease spreads to people who either have other health conditions or are older, the risk rises. While there is a lot more research to be done, people who are 70 and older seem to have about a 10% chance of dying. The mortality rate goes up to 15% for people in their 80s.
So, while young people can probably proceed as though everything is normal, doing so means increasing the risk of spreading a deadly virus to parents and grandparents. Meanwhile, senior citizens need to take extra precautions to avoid going places where they could come into contact with the coronavirus.
There is one more problem and it's a huge one: Hospitals operate with a limited number of beds and ventilators. It would not take much of a surge in patients to overwhelm the health care system, delaying care not only for patients infected with the coronavirus, but also people who have other common conditions or who are seeking routine services.
In this (very likely) scenario, the coronavirus becomes a threat to anyone who needs access to a hospital or clinic.
We botched testing. Now, it's time for social distancing. It's possible to imagine a scenario in which, even amid the coronavirus outbreak, we could still have been watching the Indiana Pacers and Big Ten Tournament this weekend. But that would have required a more aggressive response early on by the federal government.
South Korea, for instance, has battled the coronavirus by building a massive testing capacity. That nation is testing 20,000 people per day, more per capita than any other country, according to the BBC. There are drive-through testing centers for people who are presenting symptoms, or are just concerned and want to get checked out.
That is not the situation in the U.S.
Tests remain scarce here, heaping pressure on state and local governments to take increasingly aggressive action while operating in the dark on the severity of the problem.
IndyStar's Tony Cook and Shari Rudavsky reported Friday that there had only been 73 tests in Indiana, a pace that does not seem poised to skyrocket even as President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency.
Add it all together and you have an unknown number of people infected with a lethal coronavirus disease and no vaccine in sight for at least a year. The only solution left is to keep sick people away from healthy people by eliminating large gatherings of people, a strategy known as social distancing.
Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett moved Thursday to do just that, advising against gatherings of 250 people or more across the state and closing schools across Marion County. That means Indianapolis' sports scene and tourism industry will go dark and entertainment options will shut down. Even churches will cancel services.
These changes are going to disrupt lives and cause short term, and possibly long term, personal and financial pain. But, as The New York Times reported, if enough cities and states take these types of actions, they could save hundreds of thousands of lives in the U.S.
"I want to be clear that these restrictions will have serious impacts on commerce, social events and functions planned long in advance or held every year," Hogsett said during a news conference. "To those who argue these policies will be disruptive, my answer is simple: They better be."
I wrote a column Thursday that criticized Hogsett and Holcomb for flat-footed responses to the coronavirus. But, by the end of the day and week, both officials stepped up and made the kinds of decisions that are necessary to help keep people healthy.
It's impossible to know how long we'll be living under these difficult circumstances, or what the eventual consequences will be. The fallout could include reduced retirement savings, lost jobs, closed businesses and even evictions for people who lose their income during this period.
That's why it's understandable that some people might have concerns if they perceive that journalists are harping on the threat of the coronavirus disease even as it poses no clear risk to them. But I would counter that this is an appropriate time for fear and radical responses.
Even if the coronavirus does not seem like a problem for you, it could threaten the life of someone you love. We all have a responsibility to protect people who are most vulnerable.
We'll get through this. It's going to take some sacrifice first.
The sooner we all freak out, the sooner life can begin to go back to normal.

Texto completo: Daisy really likes to eat dirt.
She doesn't discriminate if there's only mud available. When a new batch of dirt is delivered, she spends the whole day sampling.
When she pinched a trunkful off the ground one recent Thursday morning, Natalie Thomas took note of the interesting behavior.
"It's very odd," Thomas said. "She must like the taste."
Daisy shares her home, the elephant exhibit at the Memphis Zoo, with four others: Gina, Bambi, Asali and Tyranza, known as "Ty," who is the oldest living African elephant in North America, the zoo says.
About 50 students from Rhodes College, like Thomas, have logged thousands of hours of behavioral observations of the herd at Memphis Zoo since 2011.
The long-term research project, a partnership between Rhodes and the zoo, is a study in elephant behavior and social dynamics. Each elephant's behavioral quirks — like Daisy's penchant for eating dirt — establish patterns of behavior that reveal personalities and a social hierarchy.
This substantial amount of continuous data will show how elephants age.
When the time comes, it will also show how a herd grieves.
The death of a leader in the herd is an inevitability in both captivity and the wild, but one of increased frequency for the vulnerable species, whose population is in decline largely due to poaching.
Thomas is "not looking forward to that day" the grief study begins, she said, explaining the strength of social bonds between the female herd.
But she recognizes the rare opportunity to continue with the research, which she began participating in last summer.
How the data gets collected Rhodes professor Sarah Boyle works with Steve Reichling, the zoo's director of conservation and research, on several partnership projects at the zoo.
Rhodes students have collected 6,000 hours of observation each for Ty, Gina and Asali. They've accumulated 500 hours each for Bambi and Daisy, who joined the herd within the last two years.
Of the partnership projects, the elephant study is the longest-running. It's not common to have so many hours of behavior observations for one herd, Boyle explained.
Over the course of an hour at the zoo, students like Thomas make note of elephant behavior every two minutes, logging the code for that behavior and indicating where in the exhibit the elephant is located.
The data qualifies the interactions between each elephant, categorizing them as positive, negative and neutral interactions, which can be matched with how close the elephants are to one another.
Eating, unsurprisingly, is the most common activity for Thomas to observe, she said. At this point, she's memorized the locations on the grid where barrels of hay dangle down for elephants to grab.
Thomas is quick to note the hierarchy: "Bambi and Daisy will share a barrel. Asali will have a barrel to herself or share with Ty. But Gina will steal a barrel from Asali, Bambi and Daisy."
Behavior patterns reveal how elephants react after a death Right now, it's not clear whether or not Ty, the oldest, is still the true matriarch, or leader, of the herd, Boyle said.
Gina, the spunkiest elephant of the bunch, is beginning to take on that role in some aspects. The students and other staff at the zoo have all developed their own opinions about the shift in behavior, and whether Gina has taken the role over from Ty.
Daisy falls into the third spot, said Amanda Schweighart, the zoo's elephant manager. Bambi and Asali fall to the bottom of the herd's social structure, with neither wanting to be the boss over the other.
Thomas interprets the behaviors as the matriarch position being in a transitional phase, she said.
Memphis Zoo's herd of five females is much smaller than a herd that would generally be found in the wild, Thomas said, but elephants in the wild also separate into herds by gender.
The oldest elephant in the herd, which is oftentimes the matriarch, is usually the target of poachers, since the older elephants generally have the longest tusks.
"So when that poacher kills a 60-year-old matriarch, (the herd is) losing 60 years of information, especially if it's made up primarily of younger elephants," she said. "They've lost that information of where it's safe to go, where to find water, where to find food, which animals to avoid, everything."
On the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya, researchers have spent years observing the social dynamics of elephant herds. As matriarchs and other elephants in the herd have died, they've watched how the animals cope.
Doctoral student Shifra Goldenberg shared a video with National Geographic of elephants on the reserve after the death of a matriarch named Queen Victoria
. Though some researchers disagree on whether to call elephants' actions "grief" (that could imply that researchers know what the elephants are thinking), there are clearly observable behaviors that highlight the emotional bonds.
Elephants in the video gather with one another around Queen Victoria's body, inspecting it with their trunks.
After a death in the herd, elephants have scattered their family members' bones and raised a foot over the body. Others have pushed and pulled a body as other elephants stood by silently and as others rocked back and forth, National Geographic reported.
The responses vary, but are striking, and highlight that the behavior observed is driven by emotion, and not out of necessity, George Wittemyer, a longtime researcher at the reserve, told National Geographic in 2016.
"The fact that they interact and have behavioral interactions with their dead in a form that is not explainable in any simple, evolutionary context speaks to the deeper emotional lives of elephants that we can't easily study," he said.
Wittemyer is part of another research project on orphan elephants whose families and herds have been disrupted by poaching.
The research, as reported by The New York Times in 2016, logs orphan behavior, tracking positive and negative interactions among the herd, much like the research done by Rhodes students at the Memphis Zoo.
The research shows how elephants both respond to death and rebuild.
Research also encourages visitor education Thomas has always preferred animals to people, she said, but the research work has led to more interaction than she'd thought.
As people ask her questions about why she's watching the elephants with a clipboard and a stopwatch, in telling them about her research, she's also telling them about why the elephants matter.
"I've even had little kids come up to me and be like, 'Are you a scientist?'" she said. "There was a little girl who wanted to be an author, and her sister wanted to be the scientist" who would write the book about her sister's research.
Inquisitive visitors can learn that Asali is the one with a pink birthmark on her foot; that Daisy has silver caps on her tusks because she's rough with them; and that both are part of a species that's at risk.
A recent field study called the Great Elephant Census surveyed the majority of countries where African elephants could be found, and counted a population around 350,000. The population had declined by 30%, or 144,000 elephants, between 2007 and 2014, according to the findings.
Thomas tells visitors that elephants aren't really gray or brown, but a mixture of colors, and that Daisy can pick up dirt with her trunk, which has 400 muscles and a nimble end that could "actually pick something up as small as a penny." Those conversations are part of the zoo's message of education and conversation, Boyle said.
"I think the more people understand about animals, their interest (in them), they care about them more," Boyle said. "They're not just five identical individuals out there. They're unique."

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. 'My Dark Vanessa' by Kate Elizabeth Russell (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: When she was 15, Vanessa had a sexual relationship with her 42-year-old English teacher. At the time, she was thrilled by what she thought was a consensual romance. Years later, that same teacher is accused of sexual abuse by a former student. Does Vanessa remain silent and hold on to that illusion, or does she face the ugly truth of her first love?
The buzz: "Russell offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement..." says a review in Publishers Weekly.
2. 'The Mirror & the Light' by Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt & Co., fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The final book in Mantel's historical trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell in the court of King Henry VIII.
The buzz: The publisher has kept a tight lid on this one, but the early reviews are rapturous. "With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of," says a review in The Guardian.
3. 'MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman' by Ben Hubbard (Tim Duggan Books, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The Beirut bureau chief for the New York Times paints a gripping portrait of the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, the mysterious and powerful young Saudi Arabian prince who ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The buzz: "A chilling look at the ascent of the current young prince of Saudi Arabia to first-in-line to succession," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
4. 'A Good Neighborhood' by Therese Anne Fowler (St. Martin's Press, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: Two families are at odds in the tight-knit North Carolina community of Oak Knoll. Valerie Alston-Hold, a black professor with a musically gifted, biracial son, objects when her neighbors, the nouveau riche white family, the Whitmans, raze the lot next door to build a showplace. Then their teenagers fall in love.
The buzz: "A riveting, potentially redemptive story of modern American suburbia that reads almost like an ancient Greek tragedy," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
5. 'Recollections of My Nonexistence' by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: A portrait of the artist as a young woman. In her new memoir, Solnit reflects on her growth as a writer, feminist and activist in 1980s San Francisco, and on finding her voice in a society that prefers women to pipe down.
The buzz: A starred review in Kirkus Reviews calls it "a perceptive, radiant portrait of a writer of indelible consequence."

The hidden world of Opportunity Zones

Texto completo: Monitor staff
The program has a compelling ring to it: a tax incentive for struggling communities.
But nearly two years after the Opportunity Zone investment program opened for business, tracking where the money is going is nearly impossible.
That's because the program, created in 2017 but fully authorized by governors across the country in 2018, does not include basic public reporting requirements for who is investing and who is benefiting.
In New Hampshire, that means the 27 census tracts designated by Gov. Chris Sununu in 2018 – including one that encompasses Waterville Valley, the ski resort owned by the Sununu family – could be receiving some investment, a lot of investment, or none at all.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service collects the data through its regular filing process for investment funds, but is barred from disclosure due to tax privacy laws.
The only way for the public to know about specific investments is if the recipients or the investors disclose them voluntarily.
“We're living in the land of the anecdote,” said Brady Meixell, a research analyst at the Urban Institute, a think tank that has tracked Opportunity Zones.
When it comes to receiving investments, Meixell said: “Certain projects will want it known. Other projects that don't want to be known that they received this incentive might never report that they received this financing.”
It's a concern that has received national attention. This year, U.S. senators are working to increase the reporting requirements for the program, which has appeared to take off in recent weeks.
That includes New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, who has co-sponsored a proposal to create that transparency.
Onlookers say it's important.
“In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Opportunity Zones and their incentives, you need data,” said Michael Novogradac, a partner at Novogradac LLP, a national accounting and consulting firm that is closely watching the zones and compiling public data on them.
“It's that simple.”
Progress during an election year, though, is uncertain. For now, when it comes to seeing all the investments, interested observers will have to wait.
A rushed legislative process
The transparency problem stems in part from how the Opportunity Zone program was created.
It allows the creation of Opportunity Funds, which must invest money in projects in the census tracts chosen by the governors. Investors that use capital gains to make those investments can delay the payment of those capital gains taxes. And investors can write off up to 15% in capital gains taxes in the new investments – depending on how early they get in.
It's an attractive suite of options meant to get investors to consider opportunities in underprivileged areas.
For years, the program had bipartisan support. It wasn't until the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Bill came along, though, that its sponsors saw an opportunity to get it passed.
The tax and jobs act was the gargantuan overhaul of the tax code passed by the Republican Congress in 2017 over the objections of Democrats. But because the tax reform package was whisked along using a process called budget reconciliation, there were certain rules attached.
One rule was that no legislation could be added to the bill unless it had a revenue impact. The reporting requirements did not, so senators stripped them out.
Now, the program is off the ground and attracting millions of dollars in investment. But without regulation, a full accounting of its impact is not possible.
That makes it unusual among federal tax incentive programs, notes Meixell.
For example, the New Markets Tax Credit, a similar program that encourages investment in low-income communities, has released five-year data files logging the activity of the program.
Those files indicate the zip code of the investment, the investment type, the purpose of the investment and other indicators that can make it easy to follow progress.
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 – which provides incentives to banks to offer credit in low-income neighborhoods – also has similar reporting requirements to allow tracking by community for more than 20 years of data.
Loans given through the Small Business Administration are also assiduously logged and available to the public.
Lax transparency, lax standards?
When it comes to Opportunity Zone Funds, not requiring such similar reporting is not just an inconvenience, Meixell said. It could also lead to abuse.
The New York Times reported in August that some of the investors in the funds are friends of President Donald Trump who have used the tax-advantaged census districts to plow money into luxury hotels in and real estate – hardly the kind of investment trumpeted when it was created.
In New Hampshire, the opportunity zones created a flap in December, after a report in the New Hampshire Business Review drew attention to the fact that Sununu had designated a census tract that included the ski area owned by his family – Waterville Valley.
Doing that, Democrats said, meant that the Sununu family could benefit down the line from tax-privileged investments made on properties.
However, James Sununu, a member of the board of directors at the ski area and the brother of Chris Sununu, said that Waterville Valley developments would not qualify because the Opportunity Zone funds could only be made on properties with over 70% new development.
“Since Waterville Valley Resort does not qualify as an Opportunity Zone Business, the reporting requirements are not really relevant,” he said.
The governor has said that the tract was chosen for development in Lincoln and Thornton, neighboring towns – and for its proximity to Interstate 93.
But as the accusations swirl, more transparency could cut deliver some resolution.
“The public should know very basic info around the who, what, where, when, and how much for every single opportunity zone investment made,” Meixell said. “These are being incentivized via taxpayer dollars so taxpayers have a right to know where the money is going.”
Efforts at change
Meanwhile, efforts have been made to make do with what is known about the funds.
Accountant Michael Novogradac keeps his own database of investment funds set up under the Opportunity Zone Act. At this point it's the most comprehensive portrait of the program.
That database is compiled from a mix of some investment funds volunteering their info to the firm directly, other funds releasing press releases or showing up in news articles, and other listings scrubbed from filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It's by no means comprehensive – not even close. Novogradac estimates it captures anywhere from one third to a half of the total investments.
The data that does exist, however, hints at some patterns. Investors appear to prefer investing in real estate to investing in business stock or renewable energy projects, Novogradac said.
And those that do invest in real estate prefer residential developments to commercial – just barely.
Perhaps it's a result of the incentive structures: The Opportunity Zone program rewarded investors who jumped in within the first year of its operation and gave bigger benefits for investments that paid off. Land development can be an obvious target for quick growth.
One other trend is clear too. So far none of the funds listed by Novogradac have announced publicly that they've invested in New Hampshire.
As the tax incentive program continues moving through its lifespan – it's slated to end in 2026 – a handful of senators have been working to add that data reporting piece.
A bill by Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Tim Scott (R-SC), Todd Young (R-IN) and Hassan would require the Treasury Department to gather data on the number of investment funds created through the tax incentive program, as well as how those funds have actually impacted the communities.
To Hassan, it's an important piece that will allow lawmakers to take stock in how successful the program was, and whether it should be continued.
“By establishing reporting requirements for Opportunity Zones, this bipartisan legislation will provide needed oversight and help better measure the impact Opportunity Zone investments are having on job creation, poverty reduction, and support for new businesses,” Hassan said in a statement when the bill was introduced.
The Opportunity Zone program was meant to boost low-income communities, in New Hampshire and everywhere.
For the public, it's just the kind of benefit to their communities that they may never know about.

Tastes of the Basque region at Anoche At the restaurant on Portland's Washington Avenue, the drinks are impressive but the food struggles to keep up.

Texto completo: My first drink at Anoche came with its own superhero origin story.
Legend has it that an apple tree on the Teltane Farm in Monroe was cleaved down its center by a bolt of lightning. When the tree recovered from the fiery assault, its fruit was never the same. The "Lightning Apple" tree no longer bore the semisweet, gingery Baldwins it had produced for years. In their place sprouted new apples that were firm and sharp, with a tartness that produces cider dry enough to rival the flintiest Champagne.
"Definitely go for that Teltane Whaleback Lightning ($6.75/12 ounces)," my server enthused. "It's fun and funky. I think it's the best cider we have on draft, and that's saying a lot."
As I sipped, I saw instantly what she meant. Coursing alongside a layer of lanolin dankness ran millions of microscopic bubbles that seemed to jolt the drink with acidity. Had I not known better, I might have guessed I was drinking a cloudy Loire Valley pet nat (pÃ©tillant naturel).
Like the cider, Anoche itself has undergone its own radical mutation - fortunately one not sparked by lightning. The hip, moody, Basque-inspired tapas/pintxos restaurant and cider bar has defibrillated a boxy space that, when it housed the Washington Avenue branch of Coffee By Design, always felt underlit and a little gloomy.
Owner/general manager Erika Colby, formerly the longtime manager of Novare Res Bier CafÃ©, sees the space's retro-Iberian dÃ©cor as a dual expression of her passion for homey comforts and the mountainous region around San Sebastian, Spain. "I've always loved everything about Spain, and I wanted to bring that here, to create a place that's relaxing, where you can hang out with your friends," she said. "So the plants over the door are part of making the place feel like it's a home, like when I was at Novare and it felt like that every day for 11 years. But this is a new era in my life, and warm lighting and living things are what I'm digging, I guess."
Also being dug: an ornate wooden door that sat in Colby's uncle's basement for 35 years before being repurposed here; quirky, maximalist tiles painted cream and light blue, not to mention a perfect square of a kitchen so open (thanks to the lack of ovens and an exhaust fan), you might not even notice it's there when the chefs aren't working.
"The kitchen's openness and not having a hood can be challenging," executive chef Joel Frahm (Novare Res, Solo Italiano) said. "But it's also good because it forces us to keep things clean ... and when people are seated around the bar, they can ask questions, which they seem to like to do."
I had a few of my own. Particularly, how does Frahm execute a menu of small plates in a space with no oven, no burners and no fryer? "Rice cookers and sous vide," he said with a rueful laugh. "I know, I know. It's really hard."
Those restrictions pose absolutely no handicap to dishes like Anoche's deviled eggs ($3.50 each). Frahm and his line cook (singular) pull off a high-concept version of the dish, balancing a fruity red pepper gel cupped inside with a yolk mixture seasoned with the restaurant's terrific, house-pickled vegetables - components it needs no direct heat to prepare. When it's time for service, the kitchen spears the reassembled eggs, mounts them on wooden blocks and presents them like smoked-paprika-dusted sports trophies.
Some of the same pickled vegetables brighten up the "Ham Hour" plate ($5), a half-ounce of dry-cured Serrano ham plated with pickled red onion and a mostarda-like apple-and-pear chutney. In place of traditional crunchy Spanish olive oil tortas or a slice of toasted baguette, Anoche serves its ham (and nearly all its other plates) with bespoke gluten-free crackers it has made by Southside Bakery in South Portland.
Problems crop up in Anoche's kitchen when some recipes are reworked to compensate for its limited equipment. Seafood paella is a great example. Mussels and jumbo shrimp are bagged in a saffron-infused red pepper stock and prepared sous-vide as Bomba rice is toasted with shallots in the bottom of a commercial rice cooker. But forming a crunchy soccarat base-layer is messy business; allowing the rice to dry into a crust would also remove one of the precious cookers from circulation until it can be scrubbed and scraped clean. So instead, the rice is portioned when it is still soft, leaving the dish more of a very good paprika-oil-drizzled risotto than a paella.
In the Ensaladilla Rusa, a Spanish interpretation of a creamy Russian potato salad ($10), the lack of direct heat results in sous-vide new potatoes and carrots that are tough (occasionally even hard). The texture makes the dish tricky to eat, since the mayonnaisey mixture is spooned onto those delicate Southside Bakery crackers, which detonate into tiny shards when the bite you take offers the slightest unexpected resistance.
The salt cod rillettes ($8) suffer from the opposite problem. They are so wet that, unless you eat them within seconds, they soak through and dissolve the papery crackers beneath. I couldn't decipher what made the espelette-pepper-flavored brandade-like mixture so soggy until I learned that it is bulked up not with starchy potato, but with purÃ©ed picked cauliflower, then adjusted with a slug of pickled red onion juice that makes it even wetter.
And while I'm a big fan of chefs using every scrap and droplet of the ingredients they prep, Anoche's penchant for repurposing brines results in unintended seasoning and balance issues. It's especially true of the red pepper bisque ($9), another dish prepared in the rice cooker. Here, all the brambly fruitiness in the purÃ©e of sautÃ©ed piquillo peppers is strangled by acid - twice - first by leftover juice from pickled Fresno peppers, then again by viciously tart sherry vinegar.
After my dinner guest's first cough-inducing spoonful, he gasped, "Good grief!" then reached across the table for a swig of my Baston River gin and tonic ($14). A smart move, considering the cocktail's soothing aromatics (lemon verbena, thyme, Meyer lemon) and sheer volume of melting ice in the aquarium-sized goblet. It would be easy to tease Anoche about its oversized cocktail glassware if bar manager Louis Pantano's gin and (house-made) tonics weren't so terrifically appealing.
Despite their appearance, Anoche's Catalan-inspired G&Ts are portioned like normal-sized cocktails. I went searching for another that might make a good match for something sweet to end the meal, but was instead shepherded by the expert server to a glass of ruddy, currant-enriched 11 percent ABV Imperial Rose cider from Eden Specialty Ciders in Newport, Vermont ($8.25/ 8 oz.). She nailed it.
As a foil for the "burnt cheese cake" ($9) (the dish's actual name), baked in single-serving portions in the ovens at Southside, the Imperial Rose was perfect. Its dried fruit aromas brought out a lingering, caramelized nuttiness in the dessert. This denser, savory-sweet riff on a classic Basque dessert was, by some distance, the best thing I tried at Anoche. Chalk that up in part to the dish's sticky, citrusy compote of rehydrated Mission figs, cranberries and mandarin zest.
Spooning bites of cake out of the heat-singed parchment bundle, I thought to myself that this is the sort of quality of dish that Anoche could produce if it had the kitchen it requires. Indeed, a hood and a little fire might be exactly the bolt of lightning necessary to transform Anoche from promising up-and-comer into the East End's newest superhero.

Texto completo: While a little late to the task, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a third bid to declare the Affordable Care Act null and void.
The Trump administration has entered the fray, on the side of Texas officials who argue that former President Barack Obama's signature achievement in office is now unconstitutional. That argument - that the law cannot survive without the tax penalty tied to its mandate that individuals have health insurance - was upheld by a Texas appeals court.
It's time for Congress to act, as only it can, to protect the American people from the disruption of the decade-old law's precarious state. The Texas ruling, reports of the U.S. Supreme Court's upcoming review of it and the Trump administration's stance against the law known as Obamacare all weigh on the stability of health markets. They do so by creating a per-ception among people seeking health insurance that the law and its key protections - for those with pre-existing conditions, those relying on its subsidies and more - might be in jeopardy.
Players in the economy, from businesses affected by its coverage mandates to insurers providing coverage on exchanges, also face an uncertain future.
Health coverage markets are affected, too, given that 8.3 million people - including nearly 200,000 in Ohio, more than 262,000 in Michigan and more than 330,000 in Pennsylvania - signed up for 2020 coverage on an Affordable Care Act exchange.
President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have been promising since the law passed in 2010 to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better.
While voting numerous times to repeal it during Mr. Obama's tenure, no GOP replacement plan came amid two previous arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court seeking the law's repeal.
As is the case now, people were relying on the law's protections for health coverage, it was in danger of being struck down by a court, and Congress did nothing.
The trend continued amid GOP control of Congress during the first two years of Mr. Trump's term.
Congress' failure to act to protect the health care system we have persists today. Whatever its flaws, the percentage of uninsured Americans has decreased dramatically since Obamacare took full effect in 2014 - falling from 13.3% in 2013 to 8.5% in 2018.
While it will be harder now, thanks to divided government in Washington, there is no excuse for not securing the system we have until a new plan can be passed.

STAND TOGETHER OR FALL TOGETHER EMPATHY, SACRIFICE AND UNITY WILL BE INTEGRAL TO COMBATING COVID-19

Texto completo: We used to worry about a country where people were bowling alone. Now we have ample reason to worry about going bowling at all.
The phrase "bowling alone" entered the American lexicon 25 years ago after the Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam published a landmark essay bearing that title. In that essay, later expanded into an important book, Mr. Putnam argued that civic engagement - membership in religious, veterans, labor, fraternal, voluntary and parent-teacher organizations - had dramatically dropped and that late-20th century Americans increasingly were isolated from each other.
In short, Americans went bowling alone. Indeed, one of the most prominent figures in American politics in the period - he would be mortified if his name were public - almost always went golfing alone.
"In the short term we are required to bowl alone," Mr. Putnam, a little stunned that his phrase had new relevance a quarter-century later, said in a conversation the other day from Harvard, only hours after the university ordered students not to return to campus after spring break and instructed professors to prepare for online teaching. "It's a big deal, and my long-term concerns about social connectiveness aren't relevant to the current crisis."
There's going to be a whole lot less social connectiveness in the United States in the next several weeks.
Universities across the country have shut down; the president of Williams College, 7 miles from a confirmed coronavirus case in Clarksburg, Mass., told faculty members, "College funds may not be used for any trips occurring during this time." Boston, Pittsburgh and others have canceled their St. Patrick's Day parades. The hardy perennials of presidential campaigning - kissing babies, shaking hands - suddenly are verboten.
The cost of the coronavirus is measured every day on the stock market, in falling oil prices, in peoples' portfolios, in empty airline departure lounges. But the cost to capitalism shrinks in comparison to the cost in social capital.
Fortunately we never used the civil-defense bomb shelters erected during the Cold War. We now are constructing metaphorical shelters in the Coronavirus War. The biscuits will be better, the moral issues slightly less consequential - no debates about who gets incinerated in the Soviet onslaught of missiles as the helpless confront the heartless at the shelter door - but the effect is quite similar. A country where people have a hard time encountering each other in a civil manner is on the cusp of becoming a country where people might not encounter each other at all.
A generation ago - when the Boston Red Sox were hapless and Fenway Park so empty that the paid attendance for Dave Morehead's 1965 no-hitter was 1,247 - the team initiated a promotion: "Being there is twice the fun." Now being there is twice, or many times more than twice, the risk.
"People get lonely when civic rites are disrupted," said Jason Opal, a McGill University historian who is writing a history of epidemic diseases in the United States with his father, Steven Opal, a clinical professor of medicine at Brown. "When people withdraw into their households there's a big social cost, especially high if schools close. That is where people interact, where parents meet. It shrinks the everyday public space."
We have shrunk the public space before, but never to the degree that could happen here this spring.
In the 18th century, when smallpox was a grave threat, people inoculated themselves and then entered self-quarantine; Cotton Mather, the New England Puritan minister and devout advocate of inoculation, spoke of the case of a man who had undergone a procedure that had "given him something of the smallpox and would forever preserve him from it." Two important figures who stepped away from society for a time in quarantine: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.
That was a period when it became fashionable to be presentable, at least in terms of hygiene.
"The cleanliness that was always a part of gentility was thus receiving renewed emphasis around 1800, and the fashion did not recede," the Columbia University historians Richard L. Bushman and Claudia L. Bushman wrote in their classic article, "The Early History of Cleanliness in America," published in 1988 in the Journal of American History and replete with examples of American griminess. They added that "the commitment to cleanliness grew ever stronger throughout the 19th century."
Now it is a necessity, but the withdrawal from the public sphere that the coronavirus has triggered could bring on social diseases such as isolation, loneliness and depression. And Mr. Putnam, the prophet of bowling protocol, is deeply worried. Long before the virus began to spread in China, he prepared a forthcoming book arguing that the country in the last half century had moved from a "we" society to an "I" society.
"An 'I' society is actually less able to deal even in the short run with a crisis like coronavirus because dealing with a threat like this requires lots of people to make personal sacrifices for the sake of others," Mr. Putnam said. "Americans today, as opposed to Americans 50 or 60 years ago, are less willing to pay a personal price for the benefit of someone else."
Perhaps in isolation Americans might retreat to the pastime of reading while we await the work of a modern day version of Edward Jenner, who in 1796 developed the vaccination that halted smallpox. We might pick up Geraldine Brooks' "Year of Wonders," the story of the village of Eyam, where to prevent the plague of 1665-1666 from spreading beyond their tiny Derbyshire community of less than a thousand, the population voluntarily went into quarantine. Scores died - perhaps three-quarters of them, perhaps half, there is no reliable figure - but the virus was contained.
The lesson of Eyam? "That we are in this together," Ms. Brooks said in a phone conversation from Paris. "We will stand or fall together, because this is something we can only solve together." Alone in this, perhaps, but ultimately we are together.

Texto completo: Warning that COVID-19 could rattle primary election season, officials in Pennsylvania are urging voters to apply for mail-in ballots and candidates to change the way they campaign ahead of the April 28 contests.
Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said the department is having "comprehensive discussions about a range of potential options" for the primary election, as officials across the commonwealth look to calm voters who are unsure how to proceed if the novel coronavirus impacts in-person voting.
"Those discussions are being held in consultation with the Department of Health, the governor's office, the legislature and the counties," Ms. Murren said. "Our focus is on best ways to protect the integrity of the election while safeguarding public health."
The state will notify the public immediately if there is a change to voting procedure - but in the meantime, Pennsylvania's new mail-in ballot option provides a "valuable alternative" and "can be used for any reason or no reason at all," Ms. Murren said.
This, coincidentally, is the first election cycle in which Pennsylvania voters are permitted to vote by mail-in ballot, after Gov. Tom Wolf signed the Act 77 voter reform legislation into law in October.
As of March 12, more than 22,000 registered voters had requested a mail-in ballot for the primary, in addition to the more than 40,000 who have signed up for a traditional absentee ballot.
But officials are anticipating those numbers to rise as stakeholders advertise the new option as an alternative to physically going to the polls.
Voters have until April 21 at 5 p.m. to apply for a mail-in or absentee ballot, and while absentee ballots require voters to disclose if they are - among other things - away at college or going out of town for work, mail-in ballots don't.
The mail-in ballot application can be completed online at VotesPA.com/ApplyMailBallot with a valid Pennsylvania driver's license or PennDOT-issued photo ID. Voters can also download and complete a paper application and send it to their county election office, or fill one out in person.
When the primary ballot is finalized, the ballots will be sent to approved applicants.
It's the best way to"ensure one's vote is counted if concerned about heading to the polls," said Charlie O'Neill, deputy executive director of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania,
But Democrat Rep. Kevin Boyle, ranking member of the Pennsylvania House State Government Committee, wants the state to go one step further.
Mr. Boyle is introducing a bill that would require the state to mail all voters a ballot application with prepaid postage, noting that no one knows for sure if in-person voting will be "safe or viable" and that seniors - who are especially at risk during the pandemic - "make up a large portion of both our poll workers and voters."
"We don't know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens&election workers alike," Mr. Boyle tweeted.
Mike Straub, spokesman for the House Republican Caucus and the House Majority Leader, said "nothing specific is being pursued just yet" as far as election changes, but discussions are underway.
"As the challenges continue to evolve, we will take a look at what updates may be necessary to our primary election process, but pursuing any particular election proposal at this point would be premature," he said.
Ms. Murren said the Department of State is collaborating with the Department of Health to give guidance to county officials ahead of the primary, including information about providing supplies for poll workers and voters to wash their hands and guidance on how to sanitize voting machines and clean tables, voting areas and equipment.
Brendan Welch, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said the party is encouraging voters to take advantage of mail-in voting. He also offered advice for candidates running across the state who are wondering how they should proceed with canvassing, door-knocking and organizing.
"We have moved to digital and virtual organizing and are encouraging other campaigns and candidates to do the same for the time being," Mr. Welch said.

THE ENIGMA OF THIS PANDEMIC WRESTLING WITH THE FEAR OF COVD-19

Texto completo: Heading home Wednesday afternoon on the long train ride to Pittsburgh from New York, my one-and-only read me something that had just popped up on her news feed.
The New York Times reported that a part-time usher at a Broadway theater had tested positive for COVID-19. It was the same small theater where we'd seen a play the night before.
Details were thin, but the usher had worked five performances of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" from March 3 to 7, at the Edwin Booth Theater on West 45th Street. This person evidently wasn't there our night, the 10th, but had worked the mezzanine section for four of the five performances.
That's where we'd sat. There are only 252 seats in the section. Ours were in the front row.
Who's afraid of the Edwin Booth? Neither of us were overly worried, but we decided it might be prudent to hole up at home for most of the weekend. There have been a lot of things I've wanted to be called in this life, but none of them have been Pittsburgh's Patient Zero.
I'd emailed the office from the train to say I'd work from home, saying only that I'd had a bit of a cough. (No lie that; my cold predated our night at the theater and our nine days in Boston and New York.) I told the bosses that I'd go through virtual copies of 1918 newspapers and come up with a column on how Pittsburgh dealt with the Spanish Flu epidemic of that year.
But as I was reading things like the Oct. 17, 1918, Pittsburgh Gazette Times story on how Fifth Avenue High wouldn't be able to play football in Donora because the city Department of Hygiene had banned out-of-town games, and the Oct. 25 headline on Page 14, "Epidemic Takes 25 in Sharon and Vicinity," I thought maybe I ought to be seeing to myself.
It was an unfittingly beautiful afternoon for a walk Thursday, so I strode the few blocks down to Rite Aid to get my first flu shot since the Ford administration. I asked the pharmacist how I might be tested for the virus, and he suggested calling my primary care doctor.
I did, and was given a phone number for the Allegheny County Health Department. I called at 2:30 p.m. The line was busy and stayed busy on each succeeding call until 3:15 p.m., when I got through to a pleasant feminine robot that assured me, over and over, "All of our agents are busy seeing other customers. Please hold and your call will be answered as quickly as possible."
In the 55 minutes I waited for a human to pick up the phone, I learned that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had ordered all the Broadway theaters closed.
When I finally got through, I shared my story - and also shared that I could be writing about this for the PG. I was told I should be getting a call back soon - and I got one.
I didn't meet the requirements for state testing because I hadn't been in direct contact with anyone who had been to a "target country." (Coincidentally, my 22-year-old daughter flew home from Italy on Wednesday night, but she's staying with her mother and I've been keeping my distance, wary of the potential irony of her making it out of Rome just under the wire only to pick up the earthshaking bug from her old man.)
I also didn't meet the Allegheny County requirements for testing because I hadn't been in close contact with a confirmed case. Nor did I have the symptoms of respiratory distress or a fever. Turning 64 this month meant nothing either. When I mentioned a possible column on this, I was soon talking to the official county spokesman, who told me even less.
The long and the short of this is that we're not living in South Korea or Australia, where testing has been extensive and systematic. There haven't been enough tests to go around. President Donald Trump announced Friday afternoon that the U.S. is ramping up its efforts, initiating a website that could lead to drive-thru testing opportunities. Until such testing is readily available, those of us who may have been exposed aren't going to know for sure.
I'll stay home through Monday. If I feel OK on Tuesday, seven days after my night at the theater, would it be responsible to go into the newsroom, a government building, another person's home?
Since we're living in the era of buck-passing, I think I'll let my bosses decide if I should await tests. As I write, I'm still not sure if I even qualify for them. But the bright side is I have plenty of time to distract myself with stories of the 1918 flu epidemic.

Texto completo: While many ballet performances include works by choreographers who lived decades or even a century ago, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre's latest mixed repertory program features only living luminaries, including two with local ties.
"Here + Now," which opens Friday and runs through March 29, has a world premiere by Pittsburgh-based choreographer Staycee Pearl and a piece choreographed by Lincoln-Lemington native Kyle Abraham. Rounding out the program are works by longtime PBT collaborator Dwight Rhoden and a company premiere from Nacho Duato. All performances are at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Downtown.
For PBT's return to the venue, artistic director Terrence Orr wanted the program to be a celebration of black choreographers. PBT tapped Ms. Pearl to be an artist in residence this season and asked her to choreograph an original work for the company while working with dancers in the PBT School.
"She's just a wonderful jewel," Mr. Orr says. "Working with her in collaboration has been fantastic."
In 2010, the STAYCEE PEARL dance project debuted at the Kelly Strayhorn Theater and served as the historic East Liberty venue's resident company for three years. Two years later, Ms. Pearl opened with her husband, sound designer Herman "Soy Sos" Pearl, PearlArts Studios, their dance, art and sound space in Point Breeze. Other recent endeavors include the PearlDiving Movement Residency series and the pearlPRESENTS dance festival, a seven-day event launched in 2019.
Ms. Pearl believes she's the first African American woman to choreograph a work for PBT. She says she was inspired by The New York Times' 1619 project, named for the date when the first African slaves were brought to North America.
"It talked about the Middle Passage ... and some of the slaves who decided not to take the voyage and jumped ship. I started going over in my head alternative storylines, magical storylines."
What she came up with is "SKIN + saltwater," which blends contemporary movement with PBT's classical finesse. Her husband created the soundscape for the piece, which offers dancers an opportunity to stretch their artistry.
"It challenges us to broaden our ranges and it challenges our classical technique, as well," says soloist JoAnna Schmidt, who will dance in three of the program's four works. "It's good to practice expanding and pushing beyond your limits. It's also nice to do things that are a little bit more abstract than a clear storyline. ... You can bring a little bit more of yourself into it."
Ms. Pearl says the residency has given her an up-close look at how a larger dance company operates. She has taken part in PBT diversity committee meetings, she says, and hopes to find other ways to collaborate after her residency ends.
The fact that so few black women have choreographed works for professional ballet companies points to a problem, Ms. Pearl says.
"It's 2020. It's a little too little a little too late because you missed out on all those other ones who were a thousand times better than me, or could have been," she says. "All of us are missing out on resources and brain power and technologies that we're not going to get if the resources aren't there to give [black] people the opportunities to be the best and the most they can. That's the big picture of it."
In addition to Ms. Pearl's premiere, dancers will stage Mr. Abraham's "The Quiet Dance," set to Bill Evans' arrangement of Leonard Bernstein's "Some Other Time." Mr. Abraham heads his own New York City-based dance company and is a past MacArthur Fellow.
A first for the company will be Mr. Duato's "Duende" set to Claude Debussy music, which Mr. Orr has wanted to present since he came to PBT more than two decades ago. PBT also will revive for the first time since 2005 Mr. Rhoden's "Simon Said" to songs by Paul Simon.
"They're all very, very different from each other. It's a big challenge," Mr. Orr says.
'HERE + NOW'
* When: 8 p.m. Friday, Saturday and March 27-28; 2 p.m. next Sunday and March 28-29.
* Shere: presented by BYN Mellon at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Downtown.

Texto completo: Several senior living facilities around Southwestern Pennsylvania, such as Concordia Lutheran Ministries, St. Barnabas Health System and Presbyterian SeniorCare Network - home to thousands of Pennsylvanians - say they are all taking precautionary measures to protect their residents from the spread of COVID-19.
All three facilities say they are following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines, as well as recommendations from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Many of the guidelines established by the individual facilities - such as restricting visitation and increasing sanitary measures - are similar to the CDC's.
Among the few exceptions the facilities are making will be allowing families to visit those who are in hospice or end-of-life care. All three senior care facilities say their guidelines are subject to change as more updates on the virus arrive.
Frank Skrip, director of public relations for Concordia, said the company is restricting visitors, though he noted that Concordia's guidelines have been changing day-to-day and may be subject to change.
Mr. Skrip said Concordia is encouraging families to contact the activities department at its various facilities to discuss alternative methods of visitation such as a video chat.
"Obviously, the safety and well-being of our residents is our top priority," he said.
In terms of precautionary measures inside the facilities, Mr. Skrip said employees have increased staff education on the virus; posted informative signs around the facility; increased the amount of hand sanitizer stations; and are paying closer attention to public areas, such as handrails and sinks.
Group activities also will be restricted, he said.
Natalie McKay, a nursing administrator for Concordia, said the changing guidelines have generally been met with understanding.
"We're doing our best to alleviate any fears. For the most part, we've heard very positive feedback," she said. "We're trying to put [plans] in place without being overly restrictive, without being overly reactive, because there's a balance between protecting residents and protecting their quality of life."
Presbyterian SeniorCare Network implemented a "no visitation policy" Friday until further notice for its skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers and its personal care and assisted living communities, according to a statement.
"With a spirit of love for those in our care, we have made the difficult decision to restrict visitation in our care communities," organization President and CEO Paul Winkler said. "We have taken this action to provide the highest level of protection possible to our patients and residents."
Presbyterian said it is "implementing a variety of screening measures" for visitors in addition to limiting in-person meetings, canceling large group meetings and providing education on social distancing.
Similar measures have been taken at St. Barnabas. At their multiple living assistant and skilled nursing facilities in Allegheny, Beaver and Butler counties, visitors will be restricted. However, Presbyterian will make exceptions for people visiting hospice patients.
Jim Lauteri, marketing director at St. Barnabas, said the organization has increased informative flyers, boosted access to hand sanitizer and postponed large social events. Residents feeling ill will have in home access to doctors and nurse practitioners.
"That's a big benefit because residents don't have to worry about how to get to their doctors," Mr. Lauteri said. "We've been caring for this community for 120 years, so we go the extra mile to make sure our residents are safe."
Kane Community Living Centers, the Allegheny County-run assisted and senior living facilities, stated in a news release Friday that new visitor policies have also been adopted there.
"We are implementing a no visitor policy except in instances of end-of-life or when a resident's life becomes severely critical and visitation from immediate family members, friends and religious leaders become necessary," the statement reads. "In those cases, visitors will be subjected to a brief health assessment and will only have access to their specific resident."
The visit may also take place in a separate room outside of the resident's room. Kane also stated that it is canceling all resident trips outside the center, except those necessary for the resident's health, such as trips to a doctor's office that can't be postponed.
"These are precautionary measures only," the statement said. "There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our facility."
Washington Health System also is restricting visitors.
Starting Friday, Washington and WHS-Greene hospitals limited visiting hours to noon to 7 p.m. daily, except for the emergency room. Visitors will be screened for fever, cough or flu-like symptoms by hospital staff and asked to leave if illness is suspected.
WHS is limiting visitors to no more than one per adult patient; visitors under age 18 will not be allowed in the system's hospitals in Washington and Greene counties.
HOW TO HELP SUPPORT OLDER ADULTS
According to the CDC, family members and caregivers can help older adults who are at risk by:
* Knowing what medications they are taking and help them.
* Monitoring and creating a backup plan on necessary food and medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care).
* Stock up on nonperishable food items to minimize trips to the store.
* If they are living in a care facility, monitoring the situation, asking about the health of other residents frequently and knowing the protocol if there is an outbreak.

To survive the coronavirus, the United States must tighten up

Texto completo: AMERICAN OFFICIALS HAVE been implementing a wide range of public health measures to mitigate the damage being wrought by the deadly new coronavirus. While social distancing, better hygiene, and flat-out travel bans may help, we have yet to address one of our biggest vulnerabilities: America's traditionally loose culture. The decentralized, defiant, do-it-your-own-way norms that make our country so entrepreneurial and creative also deepen our danger during the coronavirus crisis. To fight this pandemic, we can't just shift our resources; we have to shift our cultural patterns as well.
Already we can see signs of panic and egocentric behavior. To protect themselves, many Americans are hoarding supplies. Some have even resorted to stealing masks and hand sanitizer from hospitals. We see a disorganized response from state and local governments, delayed and inconsistent reactions from US universities, and until Wednesday— when President Trump banned travel from Europe — a very hands-off approach to an immense collective threat.
These policies reflect a broader cultural phenomenon. In a loose culture like the United States's, people are simply not used to tightly coordinating their social action toward a common goal and, compared with other nations, we're more ambivalent about sacrificing our freedom for strict rules that constrain our choices.
America's disorderly response to the coronavirus reflects our cultural conditioning over the last several hundred years. In a paper my colleagues and I published in Science several years ago, we classified countries in terms of how much they prioritized rules over freedom. Tight societies, like China, Singapore, and Austria, have many rules and punishments governing social behavior. Citizens in those places are used to a high degree of monitoring aimed at reinforcing good behavior. Loose cultures, in countries such as the United States, Italy, and Brazil, have weaker rules and are much more permissive.
Differences in tightness and looseness aren't random. Countries with the strongest laws and strictest punishments are those with histories of famine, warfare, natural disasters, and, yes, pathogen outbreaks. These disaster-prone nations have learned the hard way over centuries: Tight rules and order save lives. Meanwhile, cultures that have faced few threats — such as the United States — have the luxury of remaining loose. They understandably prioritize freedom over constraint, and they are highly creative and open, but also more disorganized than their tight counterparts.
This trade-off in order versus openness becomes painfully obvious during the early, exponential spread of a virus, when these cultural differences can have profound effects. Famously “tight" societies like Singapore and Hong Kong, for example, have demonstrated the most effective response to Covid-19. Singapore, as of this writing, has recorded zero deaths from the disease. Meanwhile, the lack of coordination and resistance to rules in looser societies massively compounds the risk of widespread infection.
While the Western media have referred to “Draconian" measures Beijing imposed after the initial Wuhan outbreak, China's tight cultural programming effectively slowed the spread of the coronavirus. China has put at least 50 million people under mandatory quarantine and deployed security checks and infrared thermometers at train stations and grocery stores. It is monitoring its citizens' health through smartphones apps like AliPay and WeChat. It's even taking steps to disinfect cash with ultraviolet light and high temperatures.
But it's not just a top-down effort. Concerned about infecting others, Chinese citizens themselves undertook remarkable sacrifices to help mitigate the disease. “They're mobilized, like in a war, and it's fear of the virus that was driving them," said Bruce Aylward, a senior World Health Organization official, in an interview with The New York Times. “They really saw themselves as on the front lines of protecting the rest of China. And the world."
On the flip side, Italy, a loose culture in our data, took days to coordinate a response. Even after a quarantine was announced, thousands of people fled parts of northern Italy, furthering the virus's spread. Italians, used to bending the rules, also wonder whether the quarantine would be enforced, causing more confusion.
In the United States, the response to the virus so far echoes our loose programming. It's been conflicting, unstandardized, and uncoordinated. Universities and public schools are only beginning to cancel classes. Testing efforts remain slow, cumbersome, and haphazard. Confused in this chaotic environment, people are tempted to “defect" and focus on their own interests.
In all of the uncertainty, we need to remember that the trajectory of the virus has as much to do with the nature of the coronavirus as it does with culture. Our loose cultural programming needs to do a big switch in the days to come. Across history, tightening in the face of threat helps populations to survive. Our own remarkable unity during World War II shows that we've been able to shift from loose to tight. Now we need to do it again with strong leadership from the top. By temporarily sacrificing liberty for stricter rules, we'll be able to limit the damage from this disease together.
Michele Gelfand, a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, is the author of “Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire the World."

Texto completo: The Global Cinema Film Festival of Boston (March 20-22), as the title suggests, screens films that take us to different places in the world where people not unlike ourselves confront challenges we can recognize. Their perseverance inspires hope and sometimes suggests possible solutions for our own problems. (As of press time, the festival was going forward as scheduled.)
Our country may be wracked with divisions, but they can't compare with those simmering in Lebanon. The civil war that ended there 25 years ago and killed 250,000 people still reverberates, and its unresolved enmities threaten to undermine the country's fragile stability. Marlene Edoyan's “The Sea Between Us" (screens March 22 at 8 p.m. at the Studio Cinema in Belmont) tells the stories of two women from different sides of that struggle — Wafaa, a Christian who fought with the Phalangist militia, and Hayat, a Muslim whose two brothers died trying to protect their family.
Though some of her former comrades advise her to forget the past and move on, and though she even reminisces with former enemies about skirmishes in which they tried to kill each other, Wafaa still clings to the old divisions and dreams of restoring a sectarian Lebanon. Hayat, on the other hand, has become an activist working to bring together the former warring parties.
Meanwhile the ongoing civil war in neighboring Syria threatens to engulf their nation's tenuous peace. Wafaa and other Christians resent the influx of millions of displaced Syrians, and Hayat grieves when her nephew Ali is killed fighting across the border for Hezbollah. The film ends with the two women campaigning for opposing parties in a national election — a process that hopefully will bring about a peaceful reconciliation.
Diana Neille and Richard Poplak's “Influence" (screens March 20 at 9 p.m. at the Studio Cinema Belmont) also features activists campaigning for change, but in this case against a more insidious and sophisticated adversary — an onslaught of weaponized disinformation from foreign sources much like that inflicted on the United States.
The chief culprit is Lord Tim Bell (he died in 2019 at 77), a British advertising whiz whose five-decade-long career progressed from making sexy commercials for blue jeans to founding the “reputation-management" company Bell Pottinger. His groundbreaking methods of snappy simplification and obfuscating sloganeering helped British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher win three elections but fell short in a campaign for Chilean dictator August Pinochet's handpicked successor. Bell finally got his comeuppance when he was caught attempting to cover up the South African government's corruption by provoking atavistic racial conflict. The film credits in part the determination of opposition candidates to expose the deceit and unify the country for that turnaround.
Briskly edited, globe-hopping, and compulsively watchable, the film might have earned Bell's own admiration for its concision and cogency. He might also have appreciated its depiction of his image; as seen in interview clips, he comes across as Olympian, charismatic, and admittedly amoral.

Truth or consequences
Meanwhile, back in the United States, the democratic process endures the relentless assault of liars, manipulators, conspiracy mongers, amoral owners of vast social network platforms, and an infinite army of Russian bots.
How did we get here? Andrew Rossi's “After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News" takes us through the history of the phenomenon from back when “fake news" actually referred to misinformation designed to delude and manipulate the masses, to the present day when it has become a mantra demonizing real news reported by real journalists.
Does anyone remember the paranoia surrounding “Jade Helm 15," the 2015 US military exercise in Texas? Alex Jones of InfoWars and others convinced many residents that it was a plot to invade the state, disarm the citizenry, and imprison thousands of dissidents in Walmart stores via underground tunnels. So many lies and hoaxes have gone viral since then it's hard to keep them straight.
Like “Pizzagate" in October 2016 when reports on Reddit and 4chan alleged that then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta were running a pedophile ring in a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. Alex Jones ranted about the outrage while alt-right activists Michael Cernovich and John Posobiec and an army of bots promoted it, until a patriot with an assault rifle invaded the establishment. He wanted to save the endangered children, he told police, seemingly unaware that in doing so he was endangering the actual children who were there enjoying their pizza. Nobody was hurt, but the pizzeria owner still is inundated with death threats.
Other fake news highlights: The canard seized on by Sean Hannity and Fox News that Seth Rich, a Clinton staffer who was killed in 2016 in a botched robbery, was murdered to prevent him from spilling dirt on Hillary Clinton to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks; the claim that David Hogg, survivor of the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting in which 17 people were killed, was in fact a “crisis actor" and that there was no shooting at all. Before long, you might feel like the BuzzFeed reporter who says that covering this beat is like spending the day “bathing in Internet garbage."
True, there's some satisfaction watching the charlatans Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl humiliated in 2018 when the press conference they hold to prove their accusation that special counsel Robert Mueller committed sexual assault goes disastrously awry. But it doesn't matter; as a New York Times reporter in attendance points out: By that time their work has been accomplished. They have turned credible journalists into accomplices by having them show up and cover the story and thus legitimizing it. Though debunked, their lies will spread online to the gullible millions.
“After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News" debuts on March 19 at 9 p.m. on HBO and on HBO NOW, HBO GO, partners' streaming platforms, and on HBO On Demand on March 20.

Texto completo: U.S. ELECTIONS Georgia Delays Primary, Joining Louisiana Georgia will postpone its March 24 presidential primary for nearly two months, officials said Saturday. It is the second state to delay voting in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The move came as officials in the next four states scheduled to hold primaries -- Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio -- have all indicated that they intend to hold their elections on Tuesday as planned, issuing a joint statement on Friday expressing confidence that ballots could be safely cast. On Friday, Louisiana became the first state to postpone its primary, announcing that the April 4 election would be pushed back by more than two months. Georgia followed a day later, adding to the uncertainty that is upending the presidential race as people worry about gatherings and places where they might become infected and the candidates adjust to a new normal of "virtual campaigning." The Georgia primary will now be held May 19, Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, said in a statement. Several other states said this week that they were either implementing or considering changes to voting to address the outbreak. At least 66 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Georgia, and one person has died there, according to a New York Times database. ISRAELI POLITICS Netanyahu Proposes An Emergency Alliance The coronavirus crisis has converged with Israel's electoral impasse, which could benefit the embattled but indefatigable prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Just days after his right-wing and religious alliance failed for a third time in a year to win a majority and form a government, and just days from the opening of his trial on corruption charges, he has seized the initiative on the virus, leaving his chief opponent, Benny Gantz, a relative novice, with little room to maneuver. In a televised address on Thursday, Mr. Netanyahu called for a national emergency government, which could give him a new lease on political life with a popular proposal that Mr. Gantz would find hard to reject. "This would be an emergency government for a limited time," said Mr. Netanyahu, leader of the conservative Likud party. "Together, we will fight to save tens of thousands of citizens." Leery of being blamed for any failure of the proposal, Mr. Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White party, said he would be willing to enter discussions. Critics have accused Mr. Netanyahu of exploiting the situation for political advantage. "Benjamin Netanyahu is squeezing every ounce of political and propaganda benefit out of the coronavirus at a time of uncertainty and anxiety about the future," Yossi Verter, a political columnist, wrote in Friday's Haaretz, a left-wing newspaper. "This is his big moment." RISK FACTORS Unique Vulnerability In West Virginia West Virginia, as of Saturday afternoon, was the only state with no confirmed cases of the coronavirus. While it may be more isolated, it is also, in many ways, much more vulnerable. A study released Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that West Virginia had a greater share of adults at risk than any other state. This was not only because West Virginians tend to be older, said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the foundation. "The factor that's driving West Virginia," Dr. Kates said, is the share of adults under 60 who have underlying health conditions. West Virginia has the highest share of smokers of any state, a habit that increases the odds of severe and fatal coronavirus illness. Its death rate for diabetes is the highest in the nation, and its rates are among the highest for heart disease, cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease, all risk factors. Given all of those risk factors, the lack of widespread testing has been vexing.

Texto completo: The "Westworld" hosts return to HBO for a third season, while Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appear with no other candidates for the first time.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
WESTWORLD 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. This dystopian sci-fi thriller has been off the air for nearly two years. Now back for Season 3, it has undergone a partial reboot since the last season ended with Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) and other robot hosts escaping from the titular theme park. Now, she is out in the human world and hungry for vengeance. She connects with a military veteran (played by a newcomer, Aaron Paul) and convinces him that humans and droids both live in cages, their lives predetermined. (This series is certainly not a pick-me-up.) Other new cast members include Vincent Cassel and Lena Waithe. "The show's production remains sleek and eye-catching," Mike Hale wrote in his review for The New York Times. "And the moment may be exactly right for a paranoid meditation on the possible end of the human race." The first season finale of AVENUE 5 follows at 10:15 p.m.
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 8 p.m. on CNN and Univision. Oh, how the world has changed since the last Democratic debate on Feb. 25. That night saw a crowded stage. Seven candidates vied to make their voices heard before Super Tuesday, and Senator Bernie Sanders was still the projected front-runner. Now two candidates remain, Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And the nation is scrambling to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which is why this debate, originally planned for Phoenix, has been moved to Washington to be filmed in a studio with no audience. Biden has been endorsed by several former candidates and politicians, while Sanders has vowed to power through, despite recent losses in several states. On Sunday, they likely will attack President Trump's handling of the health crisis, and Sanders is expected to challenge Biden on his policies and ability to defeat the president.
BLACK MONDAY 10 p.m. on Showtime. This comedy series about the stock market crash of 1987 is darkly resonant after Wall Street's fall this week, its worst since then. The second season chronicles the fallout of the crash. Mo (Don Cheadle) is on the run after being framed for murder while his former colleagues (played by Regina Hall and Andrew Rannells) carry on with their conniving ways.
What's Streaming
ALWAYS SHINE (2016) Stream on Amazon, Crackle or Vudu; rent on Google Play, iTunes, YouTube. The director Sophia Takal threads sharp social commentary through a story about two frenemies in this tense psychological thriller. Beth (Caitlin FitzGerald) and Anna (Mackenzie Davis) head to Big Sur for a weekend getaway. Both are actresses, but Beth has found some measure of success by taking what she can get -- mostly demeaning roles that require nudity -- while Anna is more talented yet intense and uncompromising. Her jealousy is clear from the get-go, and it makes way for a grim time in the woods.

Texto completo: Trump washes his hands of responsibility.
WASHINGTON -- Paging Proust. For me, this is the week when memories rush back from childhood: watching my parents get gussied up for St. Patrick's Day parades and banquets, green carnations pinned to their lapels; the family's annual excursion to the Tidal Basin to catch the fleeting pink splendor of the cherry blossoms.
Washington's most beautiful season is blooming outside while we get herded inside, making the dread and decay feel particularly disorienting.
The landscape is flourishing while a scary plague -- and the fumbling response to it by Donald Trump and parts of the federal government -- is infecting our nation, causing it to wilt and contract.
The most totemic parts of America -- Broadway, Hollywood, Disneyland, March Madness, the Masters, baseball spring training, the Met, late-night comedy shows, tours of the Capitol, Tom Hanks -- are shut down as we struggle to figure out what, exactly, we've got on our Purell-soaked hands here. Meanwhile, the specter of death speeds across the globe, "Appointment in Samarra"-style, ever faster, culling the most vulnerable.
Cruise ships are docked, schools are closed and the presidential primaries are at risk, with Louisiana becoming the first state to delay its vote. Even my bosses at The Times put a lid on the newsroom and told us all to scram into cyberspace.
The stock market, our swaggering symbol of financial health and Trump's best asset, has become a neurasthenic Victorian lady prone to taking to her fainting couch.
The days grow longer even as the darkness spreads, throwing into harsh relief just how tattered our social safety net has become for so many Americans, who are now panicked about how to pay bills, keep businesses open and safeguard the lives of parents and grandparents.
The cataclysmic changes this past week have been a shocking and humbling reminder of how fragile we humans are, as we see our entire ecosystem vanish when confronted with a deadly pathogen pretty enough when seen under a microscope to be a spring blossom.
Until now, Trump has mostly succeeded in covering up things that could damage him -- from taxes to payoffs to paramours during the campaign to blocking evidence and witnesses in his impeachment to his conversation with Vladimir Putin where the interpreter's notes disappeared.
But a global pandemic is different.
He can't cover up his lack of empathy, his instinct to mislead, his refusal to do his homework and his blame-shifting. And the idea that Trump could soothe a nation went out the window a long time ago.
He can't cover up the fact that he is not interested in public policy fixes or ending his juvenile sniping across the aisle. After he woodenly said in his national address Wednesday that "we must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family," he jumped back on Twitter to trash Barack Obama and Joe Biden, this time criticizing their response to the swine flu virus.
Trump is only interested in spinning public appearances to create the impression that he's in charge. As always, such forums offer a fantastic floor to show just how low Mike Pence will limbo. By now, Trump is surely jealous of Pence's good reviews and requires extra obeisance.
Even when the president stopped being so blithe about the virus, even after his error-ridden national address and his press conference Friday declaring a national emergency -- "two very big words" -- his attempt at maturity was crystallized in one sound bite. "No, I don't take responsibility at all," Trump said, when asked about the egregious lag in testing.
It was far from his tweet in 2013, when he loved trolling Obama: "Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible."
Under the pink blossoming trees Friday, he trumpeted, "We've learned a lot, tremendous amount has been learned."
Neat! But think of the tremendous amount he could have learned much sooner had he not disbanded the White House pandemic office in 2018. When Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked him about the valuable time lost because of that inexplicable decision, Trump bristled at the sound of a voice that dared pierce his cocoon of sycophancy.
"I just think it's a nasty question," he snapped back. "When you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people. I could ask perhaps my administration" because "I don't know anything about it."
Even surrounded by the experts, Trump continued to send mixed signals. Despite the fact that he has come in contact with people who have tested positive for the virus, he was procrastinating on getting a test, refusing to self-isolate, and still shaking hands with the corporate chieftains he had summoned.
Just like the address on Wednesday, Trump's press conference began to fall apart in real time, as he fell into his natural role as snake-oil salesman.
He bloviated about a website Google was developing that was going "to be very quickly done unlike websites of the past," presumably a dis on Obama's crash-happy health care website.
Trump's fabulous website was, of course, too good to be true. A Google rep tweeted that the site was "in the early stages of development" and that the company planned to roll out testing in the San Francisco Bay Area "with the hope of expanding more broadly over time."
Not exactly quick relief, Donald. For once, you are right. You don't take responsibility at all.

Texto completo: What's a birthday celebration without tribute concerts, new commissions and revivals of three classics? Here's how to join the party, live.
Note : Some of the events in this article may have been canceled or postponed as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic.
For Stephen Sondheim's 80th birthday, the New York Philharmonic pulled out all the stops with a concert that featured Patti LuPone, Mandy Patinkin, Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch, to name a few. In the lead-up to his 90th, the orchestra went early, celebrating Sondheim on New Year's Eve.
But there are plenty of other ways to get your fill of the composer's music in New York this spring -- including two current Broadway productions, an eight-hour binge-listen, and a comic cabaret that promises to re-create that star-studded Philharmonic event of 2010 -- with just a pair hard-working singers (and, OK, maybe the occasional guest). Details on a dozen celebratory events follow:
Anthony de Mare and Conrad Tao
Commissioning composers to reimagine Sondheim songs as piano pieces has been a longtime project for the concert pianist Anthony de Mare. The latest batch, in honor of Sondheim's birthday, includes works by Meredith Monk (based on "Poems," from "Pacific Overtures") and Jon Batiste (after "The Gun Song" and "The Ballad of Booth," from "Assassins"). Those will be among the premieres in this pair of programs, the second of which features Conrad Tao as both guest pianist, performing Steve Reich's "Finishing the Hat -- Two Pianos," and composer of a new work. (March 27 and 29, 92nd Street Y; 92y.org.)
'Assassins'
Tavi Gevinson, Judy Kuhn, Ethan Slater and Will Swenson are among the blue-chip performers playing the parade of killers and would-be killers of American presidents in this Off Broadway revival by John Doyle, a Tony Award winner for "Sweeney Todd." (April 2-June 6, Classic Stage Company; classicstage.org.)
'Bonnie Milligan and Natalie Walker Do "Sondheim! The Birthday Concert" (2010) in 2020'
Bonnie Milligan ("Head Over Heels") and Natalie Walker ("Alice by Heart") re-create the PBS Great Performances classic "Sondheim! The Birthday Concert," with one or both of them performing every song. They're not Sondheim veterans -- but when this show is done, they will be. (March 28 and April 1, Feinstein's/54 Below; 54below.com.)
'Company'
In Marianne Elliott's gender-flipping revival, a West End hit, Sondheim's Bobby is now Bobbie (Katrina Lenk of "The Band's Visit"), a commitment-averse 30-something woman in a coupled-off world. Joanne, though, is forever a lady who lunches -- played by LuPone, reprising her London performance. (In previews, opens March 22, Bernard B. Jacobs Theater; companymusical.com.)
'Jeff Harnar Sings Sondheim: I Know Things Now'
This is a dip into the songbook from an assertively gay male perspective, embracing many Sondheim tunes originally sung by women. (March 18, Feinstein's/54 Below; 54below.com.)
'Opus Two Celebrates Sondheim & Bernstein'
The violinist William Terwilliger and the pianist Andrew Cooperstock are joined by Broadway veteran Elena Shaddow in a tribute that includes songs from Sondheim's "A Little Night Music" and "Evening Primrose," as well as Bernstein's "Candide." (March 15, Feinstein's/54 Below; 54below.com.)
'Serving You Sondheim'
With singing wait staff, guest performers and an eight-piece band, this is cabaret as immersive experience. Every show includes one song from each produced work in the Sondheim catalog. (March 14, April 24, May 22-23, the Green Room 42; thegreenroom42.poptix.com)
'Sing-Along West Side Story'
Too well mannered to join in on "Maria" or "Tonight" at a live performance of "West Side Story," even though you know all the words? This screening of the 1961 film is your invitation to let loose, exuberantly. (May 31, Symphony Space; symphonyspace.org.)
'Sondheim at 90'
"Sondheim Unplugged" creator Phil Geoffrey Bond gathers veterans of Sondheim shows -- including Annie Golden, who originated the role of Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme in "Assassins" -- for a cabaret extravaganza on the evening of composer's actual birthday. (March 22, Feinstein's/54 Below; 54below.com.)
'Sondheim Unplugged'
This long-running cabaret series promises Sarah Rice, the original Johanna in "Sweeney Todd," at the March show, which will include songs from "Into the Woods," "Follies" and "Passion," with piano accompaniment. (March 29, April 26, May 31, Feinstein's/54 Below; 54below.com.)
'Wall to Wall Stephen Sondheim'
The last time Symphony Space held one of these marathon concert celebrations, for Sondheim's 75th birthday, it lasted 12 hours and involved more than 100 artists, including Stritch and Barbara Cook. This time it's planned for eight hours, unfolding in three segments, and the still-evolving roster of artists includes Santino Fontana and members of the current casts of "Assassins" and "Company." Sondheim himself has a hand in the planning. Get there early to try for a free general-admission ticket; a limited number of reserved seats are for sale. (May 16, Symphony Space; symphonyspace.org.)
'West Side Story'
Nearly every move the Sharks and the Jets make is captured on live video projected huge on the upstage wall in Ivo van Hove's Broadway revival, which transports the Arthur Laurents-Leonard Bernstein-Sondheim musical to present-day New York with a star-free cast and a cool contemporary aesthetic shaped by the designer Jan Versweyveld.

Texto completo: Stephen Sondheim turns 90 next week, and his presence in American entertainment has never felt more inescapable. Never mind that his last new show opened more than a decade ago. "West Side Story," "Company" and "Assassins" have all been reimagined for high-profile New York productions this season. His output is analyzed in academia and parodied on "The Simpsons"; Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver perform his songs in the film "Marriage Story"; movies of "Follies" and "Merrily We Roll Along" are in the works.
It wasn't always thus. He went unmentioned in the 1957 New York Times review of "West Side Story," for which he wrote the spectacular lyrics. For many years after, when he was mentioned, it was usually to brand him as a niche bard of the neurotic class. After the failure of "Merrily We Roll Along" in 1981, he threatened to leave the musical theater altogether, to write mysteries or video games.
He didn't, of course, and masterpieces like "Sunday in the Park With George" were still in the offing. Today, it seems safe to say that as long as people continue to have powerful mixed feelings, Sondheim's art will still be here to give them voice.

Why can't pundits get it right? Big Data was supposed to make political predictions foolproof. It hasn't.

Texto completo: It's been another tough political season for the pundits. Take Super Tuesday. On the Monday before the vote, a typical headline read something like this one from The Hill: "Sanders Poised for Big Super Tuesday."
On Wednesday, those headlines were replaced by ones like this from CNBC: "Super Tuesday results: Joe Biden shocks the world."
Predictions gone wrong are nothing new for the punditocracy, of course.

I've just finished writing a book about the '60s, and came across forecasts like these in my research: "Jack Kennedy won't get anywhere" (syndicated columnist Drew Pearson in 1959), and "It will be a Johnson-Humphrey ticket again in '68" (US News & World Report, 1967).
And it wouldn't be fair if I didn't mention a headline that topped a Nation article I wrote in June of 2016. It read, "Relax, Trump can't win."
Journalists have always been better at reporting what has happened than at predicting what will happen. In recent years, we hoped that Big Data would help us get things right, by enabling predictions based on scientific evidence uncontaminated by passionate convictions and political hopes. Nate Silver, who set out to do this on the website he founded, FiveThirtyEight.com, succeeded gloriously in 2012, getting 49 out of 50 states right. But then of course he (and the other Big Data people) failed miserably four years later.
Data geeks, like the ones at FiveThirtyEight.com, the New York Times' Upshot and the Washington Post's Simulator, start by gathering historical data from dozens of polls, using statistical techniques to weight the polls based on their past performance. Adding in other data, they then perform computer simulations of different possible outcomes of elections, often thousands of times, to come up with probability estimates of the most likely winners.
Big Data people complain that the public and the pundits don't understand such "probabilistic estimates." Silver points out that in his final analysis of 2016, on the morning of election day, he gave Trump a 29% chance of becoming president.
Baseball fans understand statistics better: They know that a batter who gets a hit 29% of the times he's at bat (a .290 batting average) is more likely than not to make an out -- but he's also going to get on base nearly a third of the time. That's not such a bad average in baseball.
But in politics, somehow, when we hear that someone has a better than 70% chance of winning, we think that means victory is a certainty.
Another problem with political predictions is that, no matter how powerful the computers and how smart the analysts, the probabilities they come up with are only as good as the underlying polling on which they are based. And polls have gotten more complicated in recent years.
For one thing, Americans are less willing to participate in phone surveys than ever before. The Pew Research Center reported recently that only 6% of the people they call in their surveys today are willing to participate -- part of a steady downward trend from 1997, when the participation rate was 36%.
Many pollsters, including Pew, are moving away from telephones to online surveys.
Silver doesn't see a problem with the falling response rate for telephone polls. "The polls are all right," he said.
They've been as accurate recently as they were in the past several decades, he notes. Yes, most of the 2016 polls predicted a win for Clinton. But the polls were even further off in 1996 (Clinton-Dole), and 1992 (Clinton-Bush), and much further off in 1980 (Carter-Reagan). Much internet-based polling, Silver says, has been even less accurate.
And even if Big Data were 100% accurate, different analysts would interpret it differently. Here's an example: Bernie Sanders and many progressive strategists cite data in arguing that beating Trump will require mobilizing the millions of young people and people of color who haven't voted in the past. The Biden campaign has concluded, after analyzing the same kind of data, that winning depends on appealing to moderates who may have voted for Trump in 2016 and are now ready for change.
So, which of them is right? The 2018 midterm can be interpreted as buttressing either strategy.
Turnout in 2018 was the highest in a midterm since 1914 and up 13 points over the previous midterm, in 2014. And of course the result was that the Democrats recaptured the House with a 40-seat gain and flipped seven Republican-held governorships. So that would appear to support the Bernie strategy of trying to turn out new voters.
But Ruy Teixeira of the Center for American Progress draws on data from Catalist to argue that 89% of the Democrats' improved performance in 2018 came not from new voters but rather from vote-switchers -- 2016 Trump voters who had changed their minds. His conclusion: Persuading Trump voters to switch is a better strategy in 2020 than trying to turn out first-time voters.
Steve Phillips, also at the Center for American Progress, argues that "no further wooing of swing voters" is needed. He has focused on how the United States has changed demographically since Trump's election in 2016, including looking at how it has grown more diverse.
Those changes, he says, mean that, "if 2020 were an exact replay of 2016 with all racial groups voting in the exact same way in terms of turnout and partisan preference," Democrats would "win the popular vote by three points, take back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and carry the Electoral College 279-259." In his view, "no further wooing of swing voters needed."
So we end up where we started.
When it comes to politics, there really is no dispassionate science. The pundits are like all the rest of us: They don't know what's going to happen. What makes them different is that they act as if they do.

How Pop Culture Carries the Tune

Texto completo: The sophisticated composer and his snappy songs have migrated from stage to screens. Give us more to see? Here's how.
Last year, it seemed like everyone was doing Sondheim somehow, in "Marriage Story," in "Knives Out," in "Joker," on "The Morning Show," on "The Politician." It was quite a little run for Sondheim fans, but those are far from the only instances -- his work is omnipresent television and movies.
Sondheim cameos on "The Simpsons," sure, and there's an episode of "South Park" that imagines him in a "bro-down." Every "Desperate Housewives" episode title is a Sondheim lyric, and Andy does "Sweeney Todd" on "The Office." On "BoJack Horseman," a Stephen King musical opens next to a Sondheim revival, but don't worry: "'Misery' loves 'Company."'
He comes up on "Reno 911!" and "Grey's Anatomy," on "Curb Your Enthusiasm," "30 Rock" and "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt." "The Sopranos." "Gilmore Girls." "Taxi." "Billions." The Ryan Murphy oeuvre.
Grace sings, badly, from the Sondheim songbook on "Will & Grace," and Penny's absentee father on "Happy Endings" charms her with a story about a Sondheim encounter. Billy and Julie on "Difficult People" meet at a "strutting with Sondheim" dance class and later are sentenced to community service for protesting "Bazinga in the Park With George," a production of "Sunday in the Park With George" starring the cast of "The Big Bang Theory."
Then there are the homages and satires of Sondheim's work. "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" has a few direct nods, and "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" has some, too. Maybe the best episode of "Documentary Now!" is "Co-Op," a masterly spoof of D.A. Pennebaker's essential documentary "Original Cast Album: Company."
Theater nerdery isn't a requirement to be a writer, but it probably doesn't hurt, and the name "Sondheim" itself is shorthand for erudite musical theater in a way that no other writer or show is -- there's a reason Niles and Frasier bicker about whether he's really "light opera."
[Watch New York Times staff members sing "Broadway Baby."]
The ubiquity of the allusions is particularly interesting in contrast to the relative scarcity of straightforward actual adaptations. (Or Sondheim's own for-the-screen work, like the intriguing but obscure 1966 television one-off "Evening Primrose.") You could watch "Sweeney Todd" or "Into the Woods," fully fleshed out movies that were well regarded at the time of their releases. And in a pinch (or a punch), you could do a lot worse. But you could a lot better, too.
One reason lots of Sondheim adaptations don't work onscreen is the same reason magic tricks and fireworks tend not to, either: the effort is part of the point, the shock of it all, the dazzle. Things are supposed to look good in movies, and Meryl Streep can recount the rooting of her rutabagas as many times as she needs to get it just so.
I want a witch who works for it in front of me, without a net, without cuts and do-overs. Movies can't -- or at least typically don't -- convey the unmediated, vivid wretchedness of life, and stage actors and theater audiences have a different pact than screen actors and at-home or cinema audiences. A transcendent feat of strength onstage is just another glassy token onscreen.
You need another layer. That's why some of the better on-screen performances aren't direct adaptations but rather characters doing the performance -- it's not Adam Driver as Bobby, it's Adam Driver as Charlie as not really Bobby in "Marriage Story." I can't imagine a successful all-teen production of "Company," but Anna Kendrick as the vindictive Fritzi doing "The Ladies Who Lunch" in "Camp" has its own clash-of-worlds kind of greatness. Maybe a "Follies" movie will be good ... or maybe we're best off with Hugh Grant as the villain in "Paddington 2" doing a high-glitz prison version of that show's "Rain on the Roof."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Richard Linklater is making a movie of "Merrily We Roll Along" that will film over 20 years, à la "Boyhood," starring Beanie Feldstein, Blake Jenner and Ben Platt. In the meantime, there is already a near-perfect "Merrily" movie, the thorough documentary "Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened."
Talk about adding layers back in: "Merrily" is about youthful optimism that, pickled in uneven showbiz success, turns into middle-aged bitterness and alienation. The documentary is about youthful optimism met with rude, shocking failure that becomes middle-aged wisdom and acceptance. The show moves in reverse chronology, and in some ways the film does, too, hagiography and canonization in one, the flop that became beloved becomes the movie about the flop.
"Best Worst Thing" is about everyone involved in "Merrily," but for a more focused biography, there's "Six By Sondheim," an HBO documentary from 2013 that uses six songs -- "Opening Doors," "Being Alive," "I'm Still Here," "Something's Coming," "Send In the Clowns," and "Sunday in the Park With George" -- as its tent poles. The new arrangements for some of the songs are fresh and intriguing, and if you can't be charmed by Sondheim himself singing Joe in "Opening Doors" and humming "Some Enchanted Evening," I'm not sure why you're even finishing this article.
As his books demonstrate, Sondheim has plenty to say about his own thoughts and processes, which is why his appearance on "Inside the Actors Studio" is such a potent episode. (Performances from Liz Callaway and Jim Walton don't hurt.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Sondheim and the host James Lipton geek out briefly about their favorite thesauruses -- "you work with tools over a period of time, and they become important," Sondheim says, cutting through audience giggles -- and lament the paucity of words that rhyme with "love." His favorite word is "pioneer," he says, and his least favorite is "celery."
Not for nothing, Sondheim also says in that interview that if he had to have a different job, he'd pick teacher. His classroom skills are evident in what for my money is the most important Sondheim viewing anyone can do: "The MTI Conversation Piece With Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine," a video for those staging their own productions of "Into the Woods." (There's a similar one for "Assassins," but I like the "Into the Woods" one better.) Much of it is Sondheim sitting at a white piano, offering background and deconstruction of motifs, as well as tips on acting, directing and conducting.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When it comes time to educate viewers on "No One Is Alone," Sondheim squirms on the bench. "I have read criticisms and heard criticisms of the idea of this song by people who say it's nonsense, we are all alone," he says. "But the point is, that's not the kind of alone this song is about .... Of course we are all in a sense profoundly alone, but not when we are connected with each other. And if you were with a child in a terrible situation, you would not say, 'Well, let's face it, we are all terribly alone.' Not at all."
To see Sondheim flex in a genuine classroom setting is one reason to be grateful for YouTube. He taught a master class at the Guildhall School in London in 1984, and excerpts from it are online.

He says to think of K-sounds like keys in locks, tells singers when to back off the phrasing a little, to break up the consonant sounds in "love farce." It's illuminating as a fan, but nerve-racking. Some of the students do great, but others struggle, maybe from a lack of skills but seeming more from nerves. (Sondheim reflects on the experience in a later interview.)
It's a nervous quiver you can hear even from Stephen Colbert on his own show, when he serenades Sondheim with his own rework of "Send In the Clowns."
Isn't it rich?

Texto completo: It's stunning how a pandemic can destabilize seemingly unbreakable social norms and habits. Flying anywhere anytime, and cheaply, has been considered a divine right in the global order, certainly among citizens in the developed world and now among the newly rich of the global south. The number of passengers flying skyrocketed from fewer than half a billion in the late 1990s to more than 4.3 billion in 2018.
Yet here we are, with the coronavirus forcing a massive reduction of global air travel. Airlines, tour companies, hotels and every other service industry that depends on a freewheeling and free-spending, footloose population are facing lost profits that will likely amount to the hundreds of billions of dollars.
As it happens, a lot less flying is required if we are to stabilize a non-nightmarish planetary climate for our children, our grandchildren and their children.

The spread of the novel coronavirus comes in the wake of an unvarnished report on how to ameliorate climate change that was commissioned by the United Kingdom and published in November. Called "Absolute Zero," the report, drafted by a group of scientists from the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and the Imperial College London, advised how Britain could reach its stated target of zero emissions by 2050.
Among their conclusions: Because at present and for the foreseeable future there is no carbon-neutral alternative for the powering of planes, all air travel in the U.K. will have to decline precipitously by 2030 -- 10 years from now -- and cease altogether by 2050. "For some period," the report says, "we'll all stop using aeroplanes."
What's true for Britain, of course, has to be true globally -- an end to air travel as we know it if the planet is to keep within the putatively safe carbon budget that holds warming to 1.5 degrees Centigrade. And one can read that conclusion another way: Present-day rates of carbon-intensive travel and tourism are among the many time bombs that industrial society has set to destroy future generations.
Obviously, flying is bad for the climate. It produces 2.5% of CO2 emissions, and the effects of aviation's non-CO2 emissions are worse than other forms of transportation because these greenhouse gases persist at high altitudes. On top of that, air travel has been increasing between 4% and 5% a year, while tourism as a whole, according to research published in Nature Climate Change, already constitutes some 8% of carbon emissions.
Viewed from the perspective of the coming climate apocalypse, much of our flying is narcissistic, wasteful and unnecessary. Jet-setting and even mere vacation travel is too often a luxury, a form of conspicuous display, born of a blinkered attitude of carbon entitlement.
With the coronavirus, travel bans are in place and travel-heavy events from March Madness to high-end art fairs as well as academic conferences, weddings and funerals are on hold, reduced or canceled. As the virus peaked in China, once teeming travel and spending hot spots all over Asia "emptied out," reported the New York Times. In Washington state, site of the biggest outbreak in the U.S. so far, Seattle restaurants have closed for the duration, Pike Place Market is quiet and the city's first two cruise season sailings called off.
The virus quickly forced a decline in flights in China after the outbreak was first reported there. A New York Times infographic tracked the three-week period from Jan. 23 to Feb. 13, as the number of daily departures and arrivals for domestic and international flights in and out of China plummeted from 15,072 to 2,004. Even before President Trump put Europeans under a U.S. travel ban, the International Air Transport Assn. was estimating the virus would cost international airlines as much as $113 billion.
The assorted economic and cultural effects of transportation cutbacks and tourism slowdowns will be real and painful. But our society, exercising wisdom in the face of big picture realities and the pandemic, now has an enforced opportunity to assess the true costs of flying. The coronavirus may finally cause us to see air travel for what it is, a fuse burning in the climate bomb.
We have to start thinking now -- right now, today, as you read this -- about a livable, equitable future for our children, and for that future to be realized we must embrace a world that the coronavirus, perversely, is laying out for us. It is a world of less travel, less consumption, one not pathogen-determined but instead created by our own collective self-restraint, humility and altruism.
If we learn from the coronavirus, generations to come will thank us.

Texto completo: A look at design world events, products and people.
This article is part of our latest special report on Design , which is about getting personal with customization.
Deep in the Weeds
Many regard kudzu as a monster -- an invasive vine that envelops trees and everything else in its path, smothering native species as it spreads. But students at the University of Tennessee's College of Architecture and Design, in Knoxville, recently found uses for the plant and other invasives.
In a class led by two architectural designers, Katie MacDonald and Kyle Schumann, the students experimented with turning invasives, which can be harvested during remediation efforts, into building materials. Three students steam-bent the branches of burning bush into curved shapes and then lashed them together with kudzu fibers to create an arched structure. Two others gathered dropped branches of Bradford pear trees and, using the 3-D scanning capability of a smart-phone app, obtained their precise dimensions so they could create custom steel connecting joints, enabling the branches to be assembled into an airy form.
For Ms. MacDonald and Mr. Schumann, the husband-and-wife co-founders of the design studio After Architecture, the class explorations were part of their ongoing research into using technology to transform biological matter into building materials that minimize environmental costs. Milling a tree trunk into standardized lumber uses energy and wastes much of the tree. At the same time, producing molds to create custom forms can be prohibitively expensive. Instead, Mr. Schumann said in a phone interview, the idea is "to make a customized form informed by the irregularity of the available materials." JANE MARGOLIES
Brit Design Gets a Met Reset
The theatrical reimagining of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's British decorative arts and design wing was all about thinking creatively, said Wolf Burchard, the collection's associate curator. The interior design firm Roman and Williams, which won a competition for the project, transformed the 10 rooms that make up the Annie Laurie Aitken and Josephine Mercy Heathcote Galleries from neutral white containers to stage sets for 700 objects dating from 1500 to 1900, almost a third of which are new acquisitions. Color (brown aubergine, cloud lavender, straw) and architectural details (arches of different periods divide the centuries) create fresh ways of seeing. Visitors can mount a 17th-century staircase acquired from Cassiobury House, a now-lost Tudor manor, to gaze at the spread of riches from a balcony. And defying convention, three grand 18th-century rooms have not been roped off but may be contemplated from newly designed benches. Referring not just to the glass-and-steel towers holding a dazzling array of 17th-century teapots, Robin Standefer, Roman and Williams's co-founder, said, "We wanted to let the objects breathe." The galleries opened on March 2 at 1000 Fifth Avenue; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. ARLENE HIRST
Gray's Anatomy
The architect and designer Eileen Gray frustrated researchers by burning her diaries and letters, but enough archival material has survived to inform 21st-century exhibitions, films and books. "Eileen Gray," her first major American show since 1980, is on view at the Bard Graduate Center Gallery in Manhattan (with a catalog from Yale University Press). It has been organized with the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which held a Gray retrospective in 2013. Nina Stritzler-Levine, the Bard gallery's director, said the team had dug into Gray's versatility in many mediums and her underappreciated architectural output.
Gray, a scion of Irish aristocracy, spent most of her life in France, where she died in 1976, age 98. She is best remembered for innovative furniture; her 1910s chair with dragon arms sold for about $ 28 million in 2009 at one of Yves Saint Laurent's estate auctions at Christie's in Paris. E 1027, a modernist vacation house in southern France that she shared with the Romanian-born architect and editor Jean Badovici, has been restored as a museum. She worked on dozens of other architectural commissions as far away as Senegal, Morocco and Mexico, mostly unbuilt, including apartment towers, galleries, theaters, park pavilions and the occasional hotel room and ocean-liner stateroom.
Bard is displaying lacquered panels that depict figures in fantastical garb, fringed wool rugs in rectilinear and bull's-eye patterns, metal-and-wood side tables with pivoting drawers, a rocket-shaped floor lamp and architectural drawings and models for an elliptical house and a humpbacked tent.
Recently rediscovered film footage in the galleries shows Gray in 1973, reflecting on her works. Given her decades of experimenting and globe trotting, Ms. Stritzler-Levine said, "She had to have been fearless." Through July 12, 18 West 86th Street, 212-501-3023; bgc.bard.edu/gallery EVE M. KAHN
Do My Roots Show?
Wood furniture traditionally comes in any color you like, as long as it is brown. Tired of the muddy sameness of it all, but unwilling to cover wood grain with paint, designers and companies like Ot/tra, Indo- and O&G Studio are experimenting with dying the material eye-catching hues.
Ot/tra, the furniture offshoot of the Brooklyn-based architecture firm Zimmerman Workshop, has produced its organically shaped Rocking Chair in transparent lime green and its Modular Shelf in multiple shades for an ombré effect.
The firm's embrace of color began with blackened ash wood. "We had one client who really loved hints of color, and we thought to add purple to the black dye," said Sofia Zimmerman, who runs the company with her husband, Adam. Thrilled with the results, they explored different dye recipes to generate 86 colors for their products, from flaming red to cool teal.
Indo-, a design firm founded by Urvi Sharma and Manan Narang that is based in Providence, R.I., and New Delhi, India, makes dip-dyed tables with stripes of increasingly saturated color, and credenzas that look like Ikat textiles. "We use fabric dyes on the wood to get a huge range," Ms. Sharma said. "We can now achieve almost any hue." TIM McKEOUGH

Texto completo: An appraiser and archivist, he bought the celebrated mid-Manhattan shop in 1967 from its founder, Frances Steloff and ran it for 40 years.
Andreas Brown, a bibliophile since childhood who bought the revered Gotham Book Mart in Midtown Manhattan from its idiosyncratic founder, Frances Steloff, and kept it alive as a frowzy literary shrine for four more decades, died on March 6 in Manhattan. He was 86.
His lawyer, Eric Sherman, said the cause was pneumonia.
Mr. Brown was a book and manuscript appraiser in his 30s and a regular visitor to the Gotham from California when, in 1967, Miss Steloff invited him out to lunch.
About to turn 80, she offered to sell him the overstuffed repository of avant-garde publications that she had opened in 1920.
Mr. Brown had never dreamed of moving to New York or becoming a retailer. But here was an offer he couldn't refuse -- even if, as it turned out, Miss Steloff never completely let go of the Gotham.
She remained at her post in an alcove in the store, located in a five-story townhouse on West 47th Street, and in her apartment upstairs. She collected a paycheck until she died in 1989 at 101.
"At the time she sold me the store," Mr. Brown recalled in 1990 at his alma mater, San Diego State University, "she said, 'It's very important that you know you are not the owner, you are only the caretaker of the store."'
Like Miss Steloff, Mr. Brown was hardly an indifferent sales clerk. Nor was he a great businessman. But he was passionate about books (he also collected vintage postcards), and the Gotham remained more like a salon than a store.
Stacks of novels, magazines, reference books and unidentified volumes in still-unpacked cartons towered precariously on the creaky wooden floorboards at what had become a sanctuary for celebrated authors, embryonic writers and aficionados of contemporary literature -- the last of the literary landmarks that once dotted Fifth Avenue and vicinity.
A sign outside the store counseled, "Wise Men Fish Here." That catchphrase was crafted in cast iron by the artist John Held Jr. and had been suggested years earlier by Miss Steloff's husband, David Moss.
Among the sage anglers who frequented the Gotham or fished there from afar were Saul Bellow, Arthur Miller, Marianne Moore and the reclusive J.D. Salinger, who would show up at the store with his face concealed under a baseball cap and would immediately leave if recognized.
Mr. Brown helped popularize Edward Gorey, the enigmatic illustrator, by placing his books by the cash register. He archived Tennessee Williams's papers.
Jaqueline Onassis became a regular customer. Once, when her daughter, Caroline Kennedy, told Mr. Brown that unless she completed a term paper on the Russian monarch Catherine the Great by the next morning she wouldn't be allowed to go away for the weekend, he delivered a dozen books to her apartment.
Andreas Le Brown was born on April 29, 1933, in Coronado, Calif., and raised in San Diego. His father, Harvey Clair Brown, was an entrepreneur. His mother, Helene (Kimball) Brown, was a homemaker.
He is survived by his sister, Gretchen Ferdinand.
Even as a child, Mr. Brown said, he was "fatally addicted to book collection." His ambition, though, was to be a lawyer. His boyhood heroes were Clarence Darrow and Eugene V. Debs.
After graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics from San Diego State in 1955, he received a scholarship to Stanford Law School. But he left in his third year, disappointed that many of the other students lacked his idealism.
He enlisted in the Army and joined the Judge Advocate General Corps. After leaving military service, he taught in the speech department at San Diego State and conducted research in bibliography at the University of Texas and at Yale.
His career was nearly cut short in the 1960s when he and a friend were driving in Bulgaria one night and struck a farmer's horse cart. They had also overstayed their visas.
"We were practically off to hard labor when the American government intervened, and we paid some money and got out," he told The New York Times in 1989.
Settling in California, he became a literary appraiser, which brought him to New York and to the Gotham store, where he met Miss Steloff.
She had arrived in New York City in 1907 from Saratoga Springs in upstate New York with a third-grade education, barely out of her teens, and took a job selling corsets at a department store in Brooklyn. During the Christmas rush, she was transferred to the book department and became hooked.
She opened her own store on West 45th Street in 1920 (the Gotham moved to 41 West 47th in 1946). She initially drew theatrical and literary personalities and, defying censors, smuggled in the works of D.H. Lawrence and Henry Miller.
After Miss Steloff died, competition from online sites, astronomical rents and a failure to digitize inventory created financial challenges for Mr. Brown, along with litigation.
He became embroiled in a lawsuit with Joanne Carson, the former wife of Johnny Carson. She said she had lent him $ 640,000. He maintained it was an investment. Mr. Brown agreed to turn over $ 1.4 million (with interest after more than a decade) to Ms. Carson under a settlement in 1997.
In 2003, Mr. Brown sold the West 47th Street building, where he lived, for $ 7.2 million. The next year he opened the Gotham Book Mart & Gallery at 16 East 46th Street, the site of the H.P. Kraus antiquarian bookstore, which had closed in 2003.
In 2006, with the store's $ 51,000 monthly rent overdue, the landlords started eviction proceedings and seized the inventory. It was sold at auction for $ 400,000. In 2008, 200,000 items were donated anonymously to the University of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Brown had never quite succeeded in reconciling the Gotham's congenial chaos with the exigencies of breaking even.
"The customers love the nostalgia; they don't want it to change," he told The Times in 2001. said. "But if you're trying to run the store, the nostalgia wears thin very quickly."
He was, his friend Allan M. Jalon, a journalist, said in a phone interview, a self-described Daoist, but his hankering for harmony was routinely tested.
Mr. Brown himself once recalled: "Before I came here and owned it, I was an organized person. I believe in having things filed away and in retrievable order."
But, he added, "The more I straightened things out, the more customers complained."

Texto completo: Here are some tips for cleaning your area of a plane and keeping healthy on a flight.
[This article is part of the developing coronavirus coverage, and may be outdated. Go here for the latest on the coronavirus .]
When a video of Naomi Campbell cleaning her airplane seat and wearing a mask and gloves was shared online last year, it made the rounds because her behavior seemed exaggerated. ("Clean everything you touch," Ms. Campbell said in the video.)
Major airlines, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, say they clean their planes to varying degrees between flights, and that plane cleanliness is a priority. But some travelers, including apparently Ms. Campbell, prefer the comfort of knowing they've also taken measures of their own to sanitize their airplane space.
There's been increased attention on this in recent weeks, with the unsettling spread of the coronavirus around the world.
"The airplane and airplane seat is a public space, and we know that germs can live on surfaces for a long time, so it doesn't hurt to clean it," said Aaron Milstone, associate hospital epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Here are some tips for cleaning your area of a plane and keeping healthy on a flight.
Keep your hands clean and stop touching your face
"Wiping down surfaces on a plane won't hurt, as long as it doesn't give you a false sense of security," Andrew Mehle, associate professor of medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said, stressing that sanitizing your space on a plane should be done in conjunction with washing hands and following other best practices.
Viral particles, the transmission vehicle of the coronavirus, must travel within mucus or saliva, and they must enter through eyes, nose or mouth. While the coronavirus can last on surfaces like tray tables, touch screens, door handles and faucets -- one study found that other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS stay on metal, glass and plastic for up to nine days -- a disinfectant on a hard surface, or soap while washing your hands, will kill the virus.
However, most people tend to touch their faces more often than they realize. Doing so after touching a surface where there are droplets from when someone sneezed or coughed can lead to the virus being passed on.
So first things first: Wash your hands.
"It's just as important to think about where your hands have been and to wash your hands," said Dr. Mehle.
Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or long enough to sing "Happy Birthday" twice, and if that's not possible, then use a generous amount of hand sanitizer.
Choose a window seat
A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window. Researchers studied passengers and crew members on 10 three- to five-hour flights and observed that people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.
"Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face," said Vicki Stover Hertzberg, a professor at Emory University's School of Nursing and director of the Center for Nursing Data Science at Emory, and one of the lead researchers on the study. "Be vigilant about your hand hygiene."
READ Cruises and the coronavirus: what passengers need to know
Disinfect hard surfaces
When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down too. Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.
"It's not bad to wipe down the area around you, but it's worth remembering that the coronavirus is not going to jump off the seat and get into your mouth," Dr. Milstone said. "People should be more careful of touching something dirty then putting their hands on their faces."
Disinfecting wipes typically say on the packaging how long a surface needs to stay wet in order for them to work. That time can range from 30 seconds to a few minutes. In order for the wipes to work, you need to follow those time requirements.
Dr. Hertzberg added that if there's a touch-screen television, you should use a tissue when touching the screen. Using a paper towel or tissue ensures that there's a barrier between a surface that might have droplets and your hands, which will likely make their way to your face.
"Someone who has been sick and coughing might have touched the door and the faucet, so use wipes in the bathroom then use paper towels to open the door and to close the faucet then throw those in the trash on the way out," said Bernard Camins, the medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai Health System.

Texto completo: Readers offer different diagnoses for why Ms. Warren faltered, ranging from misogyny to likability to policies.
To the Editor:
"I Am Burning With Fury and Grief Over Elizabeth Warren. And I Am Not Alone," by Sarah Smarsh (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, March 6):
I am an Elizabeth Warren supporter. I share the grief. But I think the tendency to blame any failure by any woman politician on misogyny is misguided and possibly harmful to the advancement of women as a whole. If every failure is the result of misogyny, then there is no reason to consider the candidate's own actions, choices or other circumstances. There are many reasons Ms. Warren didn't do better. I don't think misogyny was one of them.
Ms. Warren proved to be an agile thinker and an articulate orator, and attracted both men and women in pretty equal numbers. But she was largely occupying a slot that Bernie Sanders, with a four-year running head start, already occupied.
We are ready for a female president. And perhaps Ms. Smarsh's grandmother will live to see it next election.
John Dorchester
Media, Pa.
To the Editor:
Thank you, Sarah Smarsh, for making me feel a little less alone. I, too, am burning with fury and grief over Elizabeth Warren's fate. The news that she suspended her campaign knocked the air out of me. It is beyond depressing that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are my only options. Oh, I will dutifully vote for whichever one of them wins the nomination, but I may not vote at all in the primary.
Toni Morrison once wrote that the persistence of racism in this country seemed inexplicably enduring to her. She was beginning to suspect that there was something fundamentally wrong with the American character. Today I wonder the same thing about our country's misogyny. Despite all the progress, there is something deep in our national psyche that recoils from a powerful woman.
The vitriol heaped on Hillary Clinton astounded me. The swift and decisive sidelining of Ms. Warren is like an aftershock -- less dramatic but still devastating ... and so damn predictable.
So here we are now, left with the old familiar feelings of defeat and disappointment and the worrisome suspicion that the old saying may be true. The more things change, the more they remain the same.
Ann Whitfield Powers
La Grande, Ore.
To the Editor:
Please spare me any more tearful, heartfelt columns by young, educated, white, professional women who are crying now that Elizabeth Warren has lost the Democratic nomination because -- gasp! -- there's sexism in our party. Speaking as an old, educated, white, professional woman, I can tell you that her loss was not only anticipated, but welcomed by many Democrats like me. We are glad she lost the primaries because we knew she could not have won in November.
She suffered from the same flaws as Hillary Clinton -- most fundamentally, the belief that if only a woman works harder than anyone else, she will get rewarded with the presidency. The belief that the election is a contest over who has prepared the most elaborately detailed plans. The belief that you can come across as an angry woman (I'm sorry, but she did), or an angry gay person, or an angry person of color, or anything other than an angry white man, and still get elected to the highest office in this land. You cannot.
That is what Barack Obama understood. It is all about likability. It is about whether voters think you relate to them, care about them, will represent their wishes and dreams once you're in office. Ms. Warren substituted elaborate plans for emotional connection. Blame sexism if you like, but that will not change the fact that she was not the right candidate for our times.
So to all those Warren supporters now "burning with fury and grief," stop crying about it. Get to work supporting a female candidate who is manifestly "likable," and we might be able to win next time.
Elissa Warantz

To the Editor:
As a former supporter of Elizabeth Warren I was surprised to see the reaction to her losses in the primaries as a representation of sexism. I worked for the senator in her state campaigns and supported her run for the presidency early on. I believed she was a good choice for the highest office in our land given the field of candidates.
However, when Senator Warren veered to the left to endorse universal health care with no real idea how to pay for it and a 2 percent wealth tax, she lost the majority of moderate Democrats. What I believe finally finished her off was her aggressive assault on Michael Bloomberg on the debate stage. Whether or not one accepts her list of accusations as accurate, her method of attack was uncomfortable for many of us who immediately thought, "Is this the way we want a president to unite us?"
Elizabeth Warren lost her place in the election not because she was a woman but because of her political positions and her choice to resort to bitterness and anger. Like Bernie Sanders, she failed to recognize that most Americans are tired of anger and tirades. We want healing and an effort to reunite us as a nation.
Martin P. Solomon
Brookline, Mass.
To the Editor:
Thank you for your poignant Op-Ed about Elizabeth Warren leaving the presidential race. The last time I felt so gut-punched was when Donald Trump won.
I am 70 years old and feel as if I won't see a female president in my lifetime. It is too sad. I wasn't "for" Hillary. But Elizabeth really spoke to me. So smart, hardworking and truly kind.
I still don't understand why women didn't turn out in droves to vote for her.
Kristi Hanna
Naperville, Ill.
To the Editor:
Sarah Smarsh's article points the finger of blame at the media and at the way women are slighted in society, but ladies, honestly, look to yourselves. Throughout this primary season, I have been continually surprised by my women friends who liked Elizabeth Warren but thought that a woman couldn't win against Donald Trump or that the conservative portions of the country wouldn't support a woman.
So, it would seem, the only problem these women had with Elizabeth Warren was that she was a woman. They could have easily supported a man with the same qualifications and same ideas. We will not have a woman president in the United States until women start voting for a woman simply because she is the most qualified. Women are 53 percent of the electorate, and a greater percentage of women than men actually vote.
We have only to look at South Carolina, where the black voters paid no attention to the media's depiction of a floundering Biden campaign and voted for their preferred candidate. Women, burn with fury at yourselves and say never again!
Dennis Biroscak

To the Editor:
Re "A Two-Man Race? Women Aren't Surprised" (news analysis, front page, March 6):
The political force of gender notwithstanding, a lot more was involved in Elizabeth Warren's defeat. The closest recent comparison to Ms. Warren as a failed candidate is not Hillary Clinton, or Amy Klobuchar or Kamala Harris, but Bill Bradley in 2000.
Like Ms. Warren, Mr. Bradley was an effective East Coast senator and Ivy League intellectual with policy plans -- agonizingly detailed plans for tax reform, health care, manufacturing, etc., that he would drone on and on about.
Like Ms. Warren again, Mr. Bradley did well in some predictable liberal enclaves, but had trouble attracting voters neither well educated nor well off. Both were criticized inordinately for lecturing and scolding too much -- Adlai Stevenson's "egghead" problem again. In the end, both lost to former vice presidents.
To best understand Ms. Warren's defeat, give feminist hand-wringing a rest and read Richard Hofstadter's "Anti-Intellectualism in American Life."

Texto completo: Across the country, it's mostly business as usual in the justice system. And that's inviting the spread of the coronavirus.
Across the country, only a small number of courts and justice systems appear to have significantly adjusted their procedures to guard against the coronavirus pandemic. And that is putting tens of thousands of people at risk for no good reason.
Most justice systems simply are processing cases much as they always do, perhaps with an extra supply of hand sanitizer. "Business as usual," a deputy district attorney from Los Angeles messaged me on Wednesday night.
Luke Coley, a lawyer in Mobile, Ala., reported he was the only person among about 125 in municipal court earlier this week who wasn't shaking hands. He was there with his client, an 18-year-old charged with a misdemeanor of marijuana possession. "Hearing could very easily been put off; don't understand why it wasn't," Mr. Coley tweeted to me.
A public defender in Birmingham, Ala., echoed the point. "Literally no response at all yet," he said of the justice system. "Worrying to say the least."
Yes it is. But it doesn't have to be.
The district attorney in Seattle, Dan Satterberg, said his office was filing only serious violent cases. The Chatham County Jail in Georgia says it is screening all arrested people before they enter and has promised not to incarcerate any misdemeanor defendants once a case of Covid-19, the disease the virus causes, is confirmed in the county.
In Ohio, the Cuyahoga County courts, with the agreement of the sheriff and head prosecutor, plan to hold mass plea hearings as early as Saturday. The express goal is releasing as many people from jail as possible. In the federal judiciary's Eastern District of Virginia, cases involving misdemeanor and traffic offenses have been adjourned until the end of April. And on Thursday, the district attorney in Boston, Rachael Rollins, said prosecutors would ask for 60-day continuances in criminal cases in which defendants are not in custody.
Courts are places of congregation. It's common for people who are called for hearings in courts with criminal or eviction dockets to sit on packed benches for hours. That makes the courthouse a potential vector for community spread of the virus. It's not just about the people who have to go to court; it's about all those who work there and everyone they come in contact with.
Another risk is short-term jail stays. There are at least 450,000 people locked up at any time around the country for brief periods -- the vast majority awaiting arraignment or because they can't make bail, often small amounts. Why put them at risk and introduce the possibility that they will bring the virus home? Most people detained before trial are charged with nonviolent offenses. And let's not forget, they have not been found guilty.
The American justice system cannot simply shut down, of course. But at a moment when the government should be making every effort to minimize risk -- and to send a signal that this is not a time for business as usual -- officials should be making far more significant changes.
Whenever possible, courts should turn to video conferencing, just as many colleges and universities now are doing for classes. In Australia, the Supreme Court of New South Wales on Thursday announced it would send lawyers and clients to online courts, with video and teleconferencing, to "minimize the need for parties to come to the court." An emergency law proposed in Britain includes a provision for virtual courts for criminal and civil cases. A few years ago, I watched judges in Newark seamlessly conduct bail hearings by video conference. The technology is there. Courts should also explore increasing access for people to pay fines for traffic offenses or violations of municipal ordinances by mail or online. They should not simply close, stranding people in jail.
Instead, the pandemic is an opportunity to rethink how the system treats low-level offenses, which account for more than 60 percent of arrests nationally. Police officers often have the discretion to issue tickets and summonses for many misdemeanors, and that's what they should do, rather than booking people on such charges. That would reduce the potential of spreading the virus in police stations and to the families and friends of officers. Judges and prosecutors should suspend bail for defendants who are arraigned (rather than ticketed) for nonviolent crimes.
Jails and prisons, with crowded and sometimes dirty conditions, are known vessels of infection. The extra risk outweighs any benefit from setting bail for defendants accused of nonviolent crimes who can't post it. Judges can also delay court appearances for misdemeanor defendants.
"It's nuts to force people to choose between their health and an added fine or bench warrant," as Radley Balko, an opinion writer for The Washington Post, pointed out this week, "especially for alleged offenses that, by definition, aren't comparatively serious." He added that he's not advocating lawlessness: "Make rolling decisions as public health picture evolves, so public knows that any misdemeanors committed going forward could still be punished."
It also makes sense to stop arresting and incarcerating people for technical -- that is, noncriminal -- violations of parole and probation. About 4.5 million people live under court supervision around the country. In 2017, they made up 25 percent of new admissions to state prisons, not because they committed new crimes, but for infractions like missed curfew or unauthorized travel. This practice often makes little sense in terms of public safety; it is particularly hard to justify now.
There are limits to what justice officials should do in response to the pandemic. They should not release people accused of violent acts who are likely to pose a threat, a group that can include those charged with misdemeanors relating to domestic violence. They should reduce the call for jury service but not violate a defendant's right to a speedy trial with lengthy postponements for those who have already been waiting for long periods in jail.
But right now, local and federal justice systems aren't at risk of doing too much too soon. They're at risk of doing too little, too late, and missing a chance to show that the government is working to protect everyone.

Here to Help; Cope With the Coronavirus: Stay Home If you Feel Sick

Texto completo: The coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, with over 127,000 confirmed cases and almost 5,000 dead. In the United States, there have been at least 1,297 cases and more than 35 deaths, according to a New York Times database.
"We know there will be thousands of more cases," Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday morning on NBC's "Today" show. His words came just hours after President Trump announced, during a national television address, temporary restrictions on most travel to the United States from parts of Europe.
Coronavirus is here, and it's spreading quickly. Elderly people, those with underlying health conditions and those without a social safety net are the most vulnerable to the infection and its societal disruption.
Though life as we know it is sharply off kilter, there are measures you can take.
Most important: Do not panic. With a clear head and some simple tips, you can help reduce your risk, prepare your family and do your part to protect others.
If you feel sick, stay home
Even if you have no underlying health conditions, be extra cautious and protect other people if you are not feeling well
If Chancellor Angela Merkel's warning is accurate, two in three Germans may become infected. That might well be a prophecy for the rest of the world, as the number of confirmed cases continues to rise quickly.
However, the majority of those who contract the coronavirus do not become seriously ill. If you get coronavirus, it's likely you'll just feel as if you have the flu. But keeping a stiff upper lip will not only be foolhardy, but could also endanger those around you.
So if you have a fever and a dry cough, followed by fatigue and shortness of breath, stay home. Don't go to work; don't take your children to school; don't go to the store; don't ride public transportation.
If you can work from home, do. If your employer does not traditionally offer sick leave, remind them of the threat or send them the guidance plan for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
If you develop a high fever, shortness of breath or another, more serious symptom, call your doctor. (Testing for coronavirus is still inconsistent -- there are not enough kits, and it's dangerous to go into a doctor's office and risk infecting others.) Then, check the C.D.C. website and your local health department for advice about how and where to be tested.
Wash your hands. With soap. Then wash them again.
It's not sexy, but it works
Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. That splash-under-water flick won't cut it anymore.
A refresher: Wet your hands and scrub with soap, taking care to get between your fingers and under your nails. Wash for at least 20 seconds (or about the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice), and dry. The C.D.C. also recommends you avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands (tough one, we know).
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which should be rubbed in for about 20 seconds, can also work, but the gel must contain at least 60 percent alcohol. (No, Tito's Handmade Vodka doesn't work.)
Also, clean "high-touch" surfaces, like phones, tablets and handles. Apple recommends using 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, wiping gently. "Don't use bleach," the company said.
To disinfect any surface, the C.D.C. recommends wearing disposable globes and washing hands thoroughly immediately after removing the gloves. Most household disinfectants registered by the Environmental Protection Agency will work.
Try to stand away from other people, especially if they seem sick. Wave, bow or give an elbow bump, rather than shake hands. Maybe skip the kiss on the first date.
Stay informed
Knowing what is accurate can protect you and your family
There's a lot of information flying around, and knowing what is going on will go a long way toward protecting your family.
First, double-check. Mr. Trump misstated the travel limits in his speech Wednesday night, and the Department of Homeland Security and White House later clarified two important points.
A ban on travelers from Europe would not apply to American citizens or legal permanent residents. It also would not impact goods exported to the United States.
[Stay Informed: The New York Times is providing free coverage of the crisis .]
The C.D.C. has up-to-date information, and your local health department is a great resource for questions.
With children, keep calm, carry on and get the flu shot
The good news is that coronavirus cases in children have been very rare
Right now, there's no reason for parents to worry, the experts say; coronavirus cases in children have been very rare.
The flu vaccine is a must, as vaccinating children is the best protection for older people against bacterial pneumonia. And take the same precautions you would during a normal flu season: Encourage frequent hand-washing, move away from people who appear sick and get the flu shot.
As with airplanes, it's always best to make sure your metaphorical oxygen mask is on before helping others. When talking to your children about an outbreak, make sure that you first assess their knowledge of the virus and that you process your own anxiety. It's important that you don't dismiss their fears and speak to them at an age-appropriate level.
Be sure to be in communication with your child's school, including about early dismissals or possible online instruction. Be prepared for schools to close; many districts and universities around the world have already taken that step. In New York City, however, officials say that will be a "last resort."
Communicating with your workplace about child-care concerns that you have is suggested as well.
If your children are stuck at home, get some games going, turn on a movie and try to make it feel a little like a vacation, at least for the first few days.
[For more information about children and the outbreak, read 9 Questions Parents May Have About Coronavirus .]
Don't stockpile masks
Unless you are already infected, face masks won't help
Face masks have become a symbol of coronavirus, but stockpiling them might do more harm than good.
First, they don't do much to protect you. Most surgical masks are too loose to prevent inhalation of the virus.
(Masks can help prevent the spread of a virus if you are infected. The most effective are the so-called N95 masks, which block 95 percent of very small particles.)
Second, health care workers and those caring for sick people are on the front lines. Last month, the surgeon general urged the public to stop stockpiling masks, warning that it might limit the amount of resources available to doctors, nurses and emergency professionals.
But do stock up on groceries, medicine and resources
Preparation is the best way to protect your family
Stock up on a 30-day supply of groceries, household supplies and prescriptions, just in case.
That doesn't mean you'll need to eat only beans and ramen. Here are tips to stock a pantry with shelf-stable and tasty foods. (Don't forget the chocolate.)
If you take prescription medications, or are low on any over-the-counter essentials, go to the pharmacy sooner rather than later.
And, in no particular order, make sure you're set with soap, toiletries, laundry detergent, toilet paper and diapers, if you have small children.
Concerned about the stock market? Take a deep breath.
Even with the recent declines, things should stabilize in the long term
Despite financial markets on a roller coaster, The Times financial columnist Ron Lieber suggests sitting tight. Long term, things will stabilize. After all, "stocks are how your savings fight inflation, the market is not an absolute proxy for your personal finances, and you're playing a long game."
Still, the turbulence is real: Stocks plunged on Thursday, and trading in the United States was halted just minutes after the open. A 7 percent drop in the S&P 500 triggered a so-called circuit breaker, a 15-minute-long halt that is intended to prevent markets from crashing.
"Stop for a second, and take a deep breath," Mr. Lieber wrote Monday. "Then ask a question: Have your long-term goals changed today? If not, there is probably no reason for your investments to change either."
Whether to take that vacation is a very tough call
As travel bans proliferate and countries temporarily seal their borders, consider whether it might be best to stay home
Generally, the situation is unpredictable, as announcements of flight cancellations, the rescheduling of sporting events and delayed openings of amusement parks are coming almost hourly. It might be prudent to just stay home. If you do go, expect that your travel will probably be disrupted, and that popular sites or attractions may be closed or offer restricted hours.
On Wednesday night, President Trump announced a ban on travel to the United States from most of Europe, later clarified to exempt American citizens, legal permanent residents and other groups. On Thursday morning, Mr. Pence said that Americans returning from those areas in Europe would be "funneled through 13 airports."
This is all to say -- things are changing quickly, and official guidance can be either unclear or incomplete.
The Times published an interactive map to show where the authorities are warning against travel.
Other countries, like India, are closing borders, and in the Philippine capital of Manila, domestic travel has been halted.
The State Department has warned Americans against travel on cruise ships. Many businesses have postponed most employee travel altogether.
Luckily, most airlines are offering affected passengers options, by waiving change flight fees or offering free cancellations. And many cruise lines are also rerouting cruises and now offering refunds.

Texto completo: He supported George Wallace's 1968 presidential bid. But after having a change of heart, he worked for civil rights and other progressive causes.
Tom Turnipseed, who after working on the presidential campaign of the segregationist George C. Wallace in 1968 took a 180-degree turn and became a champion of civil rights, died on March 6 at his home in Columbia, S.C. He was 83.
His wife, Judith Davis Turnipseed, said the cause was chronic respiratory failure.
In 1968 when Mr. Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, was the American Independent Party candidate for president, Mr. Turnipseed, a South Carolina lawyer, was the campaign's executive director.
"I liked him," Mr. Turnipseed explained in an interview for Tom Brokaw's book "Boom! Voices of the Sixties" (2007). "He was standing up for the South."
But on the campaign trail, Mr. Turnipseed's thinking began to change, setting the stage for him to become, as he often described himself, a "reformed racist."
"What turned me off was not Wallace, but the crowds," he told The New York Times in 1978. Wallace, he saw, was tapping into something ugly, not just in the South but among white blue-collar supporters in the North.
Mr. Turnipseed often mentioned one moment that made a stark impression.
He was in Webster, Mass., arranging to use a Polish-American club's building there for a campaign event. Club officials were such Wallace fans that they told him he could use it at no charge. Then, he said, the club manager asked him to affirm that, if elected, Mr. Wallace would line up all the black people -- the man used a racial epithet -- and shoot them.
"I realized the man was serious," he said in an interview for the PBS series "Eyes on the Prize."
"And," he continued, "it kind of got to me."
After the 1968 election, in which Mr. Wallace won 13 percent of the popular vote, Mr. Turnipseed established a law practice in Columbia, S.C., and worked for civil rights and other progressive causes. He was part of a coalition seeking utility rate reform in the early 1970s, an experience that he said further solidified his change of heart. Utilities were charging higher rates to low-volume residential users, many of whom were black.
"The rate hike hearings offered an opportunity to bridge the divide between poor blacks and whites," Mr. Turnipseed told The Easley Progress of South Carolina in 2010. "Our successful coalition helped me realize how prejudiced I had been against black people."
Mr. Turnipseed also served four years as a state senator, from 1976 to 1980, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1980 and for state attorney general in 1998.
In recent interviews, he was often asked to compare the tactics and emotions of Mr. Wallace's 1968 campaign with those of President Trump during his run for president in 2016.
"Both of them," he told BuzzFeed in 2016, "use a lot of the same kind of scare tactics and fear."
Mr. Turnipseed was born on Aug. 27, 1936, in Mobile, Ala. His father, George, was an entomologist, and his mother, Ruby (Bell) Turnipseed, worked for the post office. A grandfather, he told Mr. Brokaw, was a wizard in the Ku Klux Klan.
"When he asked his father about his grandfather's role in the Klan," Mr. Brokaw wrote, "he was told, 'There used to be a lot of good people in the Klan, and they did a lot of good.' He was about 7 at the time, and he failed to ask exactly how his father defined 'good."'
Mr. Turnipseed often spoke of the false picture he grew up with, thanks to things like history books with pictures of slave children depicted as dancing and singing.
"Our concept of black folks back in those days was like Uncle Remus and Old Black Joe," he said.
Mr. Wallace, he said, would play to the lie of an idyllic South.
"George Wallace would make people feel proud of their heritage," he said. "And this heritage itself is one of terrible, terrible racism."
Mr. Turnipseed, who served in the Army from 1955 to 1957, went to Lees-McRae College in North Carolina on a football scholarship, then transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, receiving an undergraduate degree there in 1962 and a law degree in 1964. While at the university he met Judy Davis; they married in 1963.
Mr. Turnipseed first came to Mr. Wallace's attention when he was working in South Carolina on a campaign to gain tax-exempt status for all-white academies, where families could send their children to avoid court-ordered school integration.
"We never admitted the race factor," he told Mr. Brokaw. "We claimed we were interested in a lower teacher-pupil ratio -- but the real reason was all racist."
After his change of heart, Mr. Turnipseed was a member of the national board of the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action; was founding chairman of the Citizens' Local Environmental Action Network, a South Carolina advocacy group that worked on issues like dealing with toxic waste; and had talk programs on various radio stations.
In the mid-1990s his firm was among those that helped the Macedonia Baptist Church of South Carolina sue the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and some of its leaders for burning the church's building in 1995. The suit resulted in a multimillion-dollar award that, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, transformed the Klan chapter "from one of the most active Klan groups in the nation to a defunct organization."
Race-based intolerance in the South wasn't just a white-black issue to Mr. Turnipseed. In 1985, when President Ronald Reagan sought more aid for the right-wing contras in Nicaragua, Mr. Turnipseed wrote an opinion article in The Times saying that Reagan was playing on longstanding Southern fears.
"I grew up in Alabama, Virginia and the Carolinas, and remember how us good ol' boys enjoyed making racial slurs against Hispanics," he wrote. "The Southern white power structure has vigorously supported most of the nation's military interventions in Central America, and deep in the boardrooms and back rooms of the white Southern establishment lies a fear of dark-skinned hordes swarming across the Rio Grande and forming a political coalition with Jesse Jackson and his even darker-skinned soul brothers, together with various white scalawags."
In addition to his wife, Mr. Turnipseed is survived by a son, Jeff; a daughter, Jeny Mathis; and four grandchildren.
In the 1990s Mr. Turnipseed was among those calling on South Carolina to stop flying the Confederate battle flag over the Capitol dome. (The flag was moved elsewhere in 2000.) In an interview included in the 2004 book "Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys! South Carolina and the Confederate Flag," by K. Michael Prince, he explained why.
"It's a lost cause," he said of the flag and the war it represented. "It was the dumbest, biggest mistake in the history of this country, and we made it! We can't own up to making the biggest mistake ever made. And we're still making it."

Texto completo: Pitino, a Hall of Famer, had been out of college basketball since 2017, when he was fired from Louisville amid a federal investigation.
NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- The Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino was named the new leader of the men's basketball program at Iona College on Saturday.
Pitino had coached at Louisville from 2001-17 before being fired in a pay-for-play scandal and had been coaching in Greece. He succeeds Tim Cluess, who resigned as Iona's coach Friday because of health concerns. Cluess had six N.C.A.A. Tournament appearances in his 10 seasons.
"My passion in basketball started in New York and will end there at Iona College," Pitino said in a statement released by Iona, a Catholic school in Westchester County with an undergraduate enrollment of about 3,300 students.
"Tim Cluess has done a spectacular job creating success and a winning spirit," Pitino added. "At Iona, I will work with the same passion, hunger and drive that I've had for over 40 years."
Pitino, 67, has a 770-271 record in college and became the first coach to take three different programs to the Final Four. He won national championships at Louisville (2013) and Kentucky (1996) and also went to the Final Four with Providence in 1987.
Pitino twice coached in the N.B.A., with the New York Knicks (1987-89) and the Boston Celtics (1997-2001), where he was also team president.
Last June, Pitino coached Panathinaikos to the championship in the Greek League.
Pitino still planned to coach the Greek national team in the Olympic qualifying tournament scheduled for June, he told The New York Times in a text message. "I'm honoring all my commitments in Greece," he said.
Iona President Seamus Carey said, "after a thorough interview process we are confident that Rick's experience and commitment to Iona and our community make him the right person to continue to build on Tim Cluess' success."
Pitino's return to college basketball comes nearly six months after he and Louisville settled lawsuits stemming from his departure in 2017 in the wake of a federal investigation of corruption in college basketball.
Pitino had sued the University of Louisville Athletic Association for more than $ 38.7 million in November 2017, accusing the association of breaching its contract by firing him for cause. The school had countersued and sought monetary damages for vacated games and bonuses. Pitino received no money in the settlement, with his personnel file changing from termination to a resignation effective 13 days before he was fired.
The settlement closed a bitter final chapter between the school and Pitino, who wasn't named in the federal complaint. He repeatedly said he knew nothing about payments made to the family of a recruit to sign with Louisville.
The school's acknowledgment of its involvement in the federal investigation came as it appealed N.C.A.A. penalties that cost Louisville its 2013 national championship.
In that case, the governing body ordered the vacation of 123 victories, including the Cardinals' third national title and their 2012 Final Four appearance, following an escort's allegations that the former Louisville staffer Andre McGee had hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with players and recruits.
Pitino said he was unaware of any of the activities described in the book. While Louisville reiterated in a joint settlement statement that infractions under his watch led to "serious consequences" for the school, it acknowledged Pitino's success and commitment to his players and thanked him for his service.

Warren Bankruptcy Plan Gets Endorsement of Biden

Texto completo: The two clashed over bankruptcy policy more than a decade ago. But Joseph R. Biden Jr. now supports Elizabeth Warren's plan that allows student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has battled with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the past over the issue of bankruptcy, now supports a plan by Ms. Warren to make changes to the bankruptcy system, his presidential campaign confirmed on Saturday.
Mr. Biden would work toward putting in place her bankruptcy plan as president, and he could address the issue at greater length in Sunday night's debate, Biden advisers said.
It is the latest sign that Mr. Biden, fresh off a string of victories, is looking for ways to engage younger and more liberal voters who have remained skeptical of his candidacy, and it reflects a recognition among his allies that he will need enthusiastic support from progressives in a general election should he become the Democratic nominee.
The move also comes amid speculation over whether Ms. Warren, who dropped out of the race this month, will issue an endorsement of Mr. Biden or of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, his chief rival for the nomination, or whether she sits out the primary entirely.
"I've endorsed Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposal, which in fact goes further, allows for student debt to be relieved in bankruptcy," Mr. Biden said in a virtual town-hall-style event on Friday night as he talked about the importance of access to education. He added that the bankruptcy issue was a possible area of agreement with Mr. Sanders.
And on Saturday, the National Education Association -- which, at around three million members, is the nation's largest labor union -- said it was endorsing Mr. Biden to be the Democratic nominee.
The clash between Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden over the nation's bankruptcy system took place more than a decade ago, when Ms. Warren was a Harvard law professor and Mr. Biden was a senator from Delaware. Ms. Warren was a vocal opponent of a 2005 bankruptcy overhaul that Mr. Biden supported. The bankruptcy legislation ultimately passed and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.
On the day Mr. Biden entered the presidential race last year, Ms. Warren jabbed him over the issue, saying that he had sided with the credit card companies when she was fighting for consumers.
In January, as a presidential candidate, Ms. Warren laid out a plan to roll back provisions in the 2005 bill, which she said was "terrible for families in need." Her plan seeks to make it easier for people to go through the bankruptcy process, and it would allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy like other debts.
Mr. Biden's remark about endorsing the bankruptcy plan came in response to a question about what he would do to engage supporters of Mr. Sanders. The two men will face off one-on-one in a debate on Sunday.
"Bernie and I agree on a whole range of issues," Mr. Biden said, pointing to subjects including climate change and education, and stressing his willingness to support Mr. Sanders if he is the nominee. Mr. Biden said he also hoped that the choice would be "a matter of alternatives."
"You know, you may not agree with every detail that I propose, but the fact is that it's awfully difficult to conclude that I'm anywhere near Donald Trump," he said.
In its endorsement of Mr. Biden for the Democratic nomination, the statement from the National Education Association cited Mr. Biden's education plans and said that he and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden -- herself a member of the organization -- "have consistently reached out to N.E.A. members across the country building the broad support among N.E.A. members."
The N.E.A. endorsement comes on the weekend before a slate of large, delegate-rich states -- Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona -- are scheduled to hold primaries. In those states, the organization plans to run a comprehensive outreach effort including digital advertising and to mobilize members to volunteer to support Mr. Biden.
"As president, he is committed to attracting and retaining the best educators by paying them as the professionals that they are as well as increasing funding for support staff and paraprofessionals," said Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the organization, calling him a "tireless advocate for public education" and "the partner that students and educators need now in the White House."

Texto completo: Cheetie Kumar, a chef and rock guitarist, is emblematic of the capital city's evolution. She serves up some of her favorite spots in Raleigh.
The recent revival of downtown Raleigh hasn't garnered as much attention as that of neighboring Durham. But North Carolina's capital, with its inviting new train station, restored warehouses and celebrated food scene, is no less impressive.
"It's a place that is so surprisingly and unboisterously diverse," said Cheetie Kumar, a local chef and rock guitarist who grew up in northern India and the Bronx before moving to Raleigh in the 1990s. As the chef-owner of Garland, an Indo-Pan-Asian restaurant with an adjoining music venue, Kings, and cocktail bar, Neptunes Parlour, Ms. Kumar is emblematic of the city's evolution.
These days, she said, "the cornerstones of our city, as far as the downtown culinary scene, are all owned and operated by either women or immigrants." In addition to her own businesses, she easily rattled off a list of notable neighbors, from Bida Manda and Brewery Bhavana (run by Laotian siblings) to Poole's Diner (one of six Raleigh establishments from the chef Ashley Christensen, a James Beard award winner). And, Ms. Kumar said, "there are new places opening up all the time." Here are a few of her current Raleigh favorites, where you might find her when she's not in the kitchen or playing with her band, Birds of Avalon.
1. Boulted Bread
Ms. Kumar still dreams of the rustic levain at this artisanal bakery (for health reasons, she's now reluctantly gluten-free). "They mill their own flour, everything is natural fermentation," she said, and you can taste the difference: "Their bread is otherworldly." Made from heirloom grains that are stone-milled in house, the chewy baguettes, seeded rye, and spelt sourdough loaves are sold alongside a tempting array of croissants and pastries.

Upstairs from a Mexican cantina, this mezcaleria has a rooftop patio and an expansive collection of smoky spirits sourced by the Colombian owner, Angela Salamanca. "Their drinks are really well balanced," Ms. Kumar said. "I'm really big on tequila and rum, so I like bars that celebrate those spirits."

3. Nice Price Books and Records
"You can tell that whoever's stocking their shelves and their record bins really loves what they do," Ms. Kumar said of this independent shop filled with used books, cassettes, CDs and vinyl. In 2018, a satellite outpost opened in Raleigh's Oakwood neighborhood, where you'll regularly find live music and listening parties, she added. "It's a wonderful place."

4. Heirloom Brewshop
This serene space introduced Raleigh to "an Asian perspective on a coffee shop." Opened in late 2018 by a young local couple, Chuan Tsay and Anna Phommavong, both second-generation Americans with Taiwanese and Laotian roots, respectively, the bustling all-day locale serves mochi doughnuts, five-spice lattes, Japanese milk toasts, Taiwanese fried chicken and sake-based cocktails -- "things you don't see every day in Raleigh," Ms. Kumar said.

5. Transfer Co. Food Hall
In a restored brick warehouse, this buzzy food market opened last year with "a bubbling new crop of people doing interesting things," she said. For the freshest catch from the North Carolina coast, Ms. Kumar heads to Locals Oyster Bar, "a fish-market-slash-seafood restaurant." Another favorite vendor is Alimentari at Left Bank, a whole-animal butchery and charcuterie shop with Italian specialties, such as hand-rolled pasta and pecorino cheese.

Texto completo: As some married couples seek to join their identities, while also acknowledging they are equals, they are combining surnames or are creating entirely new ones.
Tasha Mente, a 31-year-old marketing vice president in Oakland, Calif., had a note in the program on the day she married Joe Mente, a 34-year-old engineering manager.
"Traditionally, in heterosexual marriages," read the program, "married women are expected to take their husband's last name. Neither of us believe that a woman should be expected to lose her identity in favor of a man's if that is not her choice. We wanted a mutual last name so that it was clear from the onset that we are a family."
Their solution was to establish Mente, the Spanish word for "mind," as both their last names (hers was Peláez, his Schneider), reflecting their commitment to mindfulness and their admiration of each other's intellect while honoring the bride's Colombian roots.
Name changes like these aren't yet commonplace -- a 2018 study in the Journal of Family Issues found that just 3 percent of men changed their names upon marriage -- but they're gaining popularity as couples seek to join their identities while acknowledging their status as equals.
Kelsey Johnold, a 34-year-old business analyst in Seattle, and her husband Nate combined their surnames Dippold and Johnson. Jenny Bristol, a 46-year-old writer in Arizona, and her husband chose an entirely new name, Bristol, simply because they liked it.
Celebrities and public figures have even made headlines for unconventional name-changing decisions. The actress Zoe Saldana's husband, Marco, adopted her last name. In 1987, the former Los Angeles mayor, Tony Villaraigosa, chose a name that is a combination of his original name, Villar, and his then wife Connie Raigosa's name.
Colie Christensen, founder of NewlyNamed, which provides online and shippable name change kits for newlyweds, said the most common alternative name changes she sees are couples combining their last names into one, both spouses taking a hyphenated name, and husbands taking wives' names. In the latter case, it's less often a political statement than a result of the husband not liking his last name, she said. Hyphenated names are becoming especially common, as they allow children to have both parents' last names, according to Ms. Christensen.
Some of the first people to do this have been L.G.B.T.Q. couples, for whom the default of both partners taking a groom's name often isn't applicable. Scott Clover (formerly Marquardt), a 49-year-old intuitive healer in New York, and his husband, Michael Clover (formerly Fiorentino), chose their last name because of their love of nature and their affinity for the symbolism of the clover. "We wanted our union to represent my individuality as well as Michael's, and that our bond would create a third energy," Scott Clover said.

Shanna Katz Kattari, a 34-year-old professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work, and her husband, a trans man, combined their names Katz and Pittari to create their last name. "We wanted to have a shared last name but didn't want either of us to feel like we were giving our name up," she said. "Plus, it felt like a way to queer a really heteronormative institution."
Society isn't always set up to accommodate these kinds of name changes. Ashley Stull Meyers, a 31-year-old arts administrator in Portland, Ore., who combined her maiden name Stull and her husband's name Meyers, was told when she renewed her driver's license that she couldn't have a two-part last name without a hyphen.
"Some administrative people just don't seem to be able to wrap their minds around it, while others insist their computer systems or government forms won't allow it," Ms. Stull Meyers said. Samantha Bellinger, an event planner in North Hero, Vt., has found that the women she works with can usually change their last names with just their wedding certificates, whereas men sometimes have to appear in court.
Laws around name changing vary from state to state and can get quite technical. Maxine Seya, a 26-year-old journalist in Newport Beach, Calif., and her husband were unable to create the name they originally wanted, Sera, because of a California law that allows couples to take "a name combining into a single last name all or a segment of the current last name or the last name of either spouse given at birth." Their original idea combined her name Yang and his name Cser, but "ser" and "a" weren't considered segments of each name, defined as two or more letters.
Tracy Brisson, a wedding officiant in Savannah, Ga., said grooms she works with have been allowed to take their brides' last names in Georgia, but one had to petition the court to do so in Ohio. Georgia presents its own obstacles, though: It only allows one spouse in a marriage to take on a hyphenated name.
Name changes also may present challenges for those looking to keep their lineages traceable, though Ms. Christensen said this isn't as much of an issue as one might think. "Most name changes are public record and well documented," she said. "If your name change requires a court order, in most cases, the public can access the court filings online."
Despite some couples getting inventive with their last names, the tradition of brides taking grooms' last names is still the norm. A 2015 Google Consumer Survey conducted by The New York Times found that it was becoming increasingly popular for women to keep their maiden names, but still, only 20 percent of women were doing so, and only 10 percent were choosing alternative options like hyphenated names.
"The norms are changing, at least in urban areas, when it comes to the bride changing her name -- but whose name will future children take? If the answer is automatically the child's father, then the traditional system is still in play," said Kathryn Stamoulis, a psychologist specializing in women's issues. "Weddings can be an area that is hard to buck tradition because weddings involve two families. It involves expectations, opinions, hopes and dreams of people we love, or hope will love us."
Still, Ms. Christensen expects the popularity of inventive last names to grow.
"Traditions and rules are evolving," she said. "It becomes a decision for the couple to make together rather than the default. Your last name is a big part of your identity, and I think couples will continue to take advantage of their legal name-change rights to choose a last name that works the best for their relationship."

Texto completo: Katie Stout is the latest subject to take our "Make T Something" challenge.
The Brooklyn-based designer Katie Stout creates imaginative, unconventional housewares that often eschew utility. In fact, her pieces -- which include dramatically spiked ceramic lamps and floppy chairs made from brightly hued fabric wrapped in vinyl -- "could potentially cause more trouble" to live with than not, she says with a laugh. She has also become known for her ongoing series of cartoonlike "girls," candy-colored ceramic sculptures of nude women performing various tasks, such as holding up lampshades or mirrors, that playfully call attention to the multiple roles women are often expected to take on in domestic spaces.
Stout, 31, likes to name these women after people she's encountered in her life ("The next one is going to be named Coco," she joked when we spoke recently) and so it was not entirely surprising that for our Make T Something series -- for which participants must create something in under one hour using only some basic craft supplies, a copy of The New York Times and one item of their choosing (colorful glitter, in Stout's case) -- she called the six-limbed marionette she crafted Nancy. That sparkling creature, she explained, may have been a subconscious "manifestation of Nancy Pelosi," the House speaker who was often in the news at that time during the impeachment trial. The challenge was entirely within Stout's wheelhouse: Her work regularly incorporates scraps and found objects -- several of her bowlegged chairs, for example, have been stuffed with her own repurposed sweaters, and she once created a small model of the Arc de Triomphe called the "Arc de Trash" (2019) entirely from her studio detritus -- and she has a loose way of working. "I'm very comfortable with not knowing what the outcome is going to be," she says.
But a residency last fall at the century-old Fonderia Artistica Battaglia foundry in Milan inspired her to begin experimenting with bronze and glass, precious materials that require more careful engineering than ceramic. "I want them to feel really fertile, like they're about to explode," she says of her new folk art-inspired home furnishings in glass and metal, some of which incorporate flower and fruit motifs. These pieces -- which include a rectangular bronze cabinet decorated with lumpy ceramic chains and lilies -- are slated to debut in November at R & Company, the New York gallery where Stout is currently exhibiting a series of sconces in the show "It's Lit." "I get the sense people have been craving this feeling of home and stability because the environment is so chaotic," she says, "So I try to make each piece its own little universe."

Yes, I'm Now 50. No, I'm Not Ready.

Texto completo: Someone does still want to sleep with you, but you don't get to decide who that is. And other lessons for my next decade.
PARIS -- I turn 50 today.
There, I've said it, which is more than some friends of mine can manage. One just calls it %) -- shift 50 on the keyboard. Another describes her age entirely in fear emojis.
In search of a more cheerful approach, I got in touch with a man who threw a rollicking 50th-birthday party in December. He said that once the high from his festivities wore off, he fell into a depression and tested positive for a condition that can lead to gout.
I should probably worry about the coronavirus instead of turning 50, but it turns out that I can worry about both. It doesn't help that, in French the word "quarantaine" can mean both being in your 40s and isolating sick patients (because boats from plague-stricken countries used to wait 40 days before unloading their goods).
What's it like to be in your 50s? My 40s taught me that it's easier to cope with new developments when you can name them. So to brace myself (and my anxious cohort) for the coming decade, here are some of the changes in store for us:
Your body becomes an accidental autobiography. There's the scar from when I had a lymph node removed, and another from when a surgeon took off my borderline back mole. Loose skin on my stomach reminds me that I went full term with twins. A lady who works at the Moroccan steam bath near my house once looked at me and exclaimed, "Ah, you breastfed!"
You won't accomplish everything. Or in my case, almost anything. This year, I'd planned to write a musical, start a podcast and try stand-up comedy. I haven't done any of those. In the weeks before my birthday I went on a no-carb starvation diet, so at least I'd turn 50 as a size 4. ("I'll be so skinny you'll forget I'm old," I texted to a 30-something man I know, who didn't reply.)
You're more settled. The 40s bring an explosion of new insights and the feeling that it's now-or-never to change your life. You're becoming who you really are. "In the 40s you're still in chaos," a friend in her 60s explained. In the 50s, you have revelation fatigue and just want to enjoy what you've learned.
You know yourself better, but that knowledge is disappointing. I grew up in Miami reading obsessively about the Holocaust and imagining how I'd have behaved in 1940s Europe. Now that we live with the coronavirus, a gangster president and impending planetary disaster, I know exactly what I'll do when faced with catastrophe: practically nothing. I'll refuse plastic bags, retweet scary articles and continue to write about my own life. At least in 25 years no one will condemn me for this, because they'll be living on rafts. (Miami itself is forecast to be partly underwater by 2045.)
Still, your self-esteem doesn't flatline as easily. You feel like less of an impostor, in part because you've lived long enough to accumulate small accomplishments. In moments of near despair, I remind myself that a student devoted a section of her master's thesis to the use of italics in the French translation of my book.
You can't hide from time. I wasn't bothered when my doctor prescribed hormonal gel or when a hairdresser offered to dye my eyebrows. But I can sum up the physical trauma of the 50s in two words: wrist wrinkles. I've also been grappling with an existential question: Since I've spent decades investing in expensive skin care "rituals," why don't I look any better than my 50-year-old husband, who has never spent a dime on any of it?
Your sex appeal doesn't evaporate, but it evolves. When I was 45, a friend asked, "Do you feel like you have five years left before no one wants to sleep with you anymore?" He was wrong. At a party recently, I was chatted up by the host's elderly father. Someone does still want to sleep with you, but you don't get to decide who that is.
You're better at spotting trends, because you've witnessed so many of them. I can see that bilingual is the new gifted, listening is the new talking, and -- for environmental reasons -- thrifting is the new shopping (or as my teenage daughter said when I tried to buy new jeans, "Are you trying to murder your grandchildren?"). But age also brings fresh doubts: Am I rejecting a new idea because it's wrong or because I'm old?
No one cares how old you feel. Age is only "just a number" in the way that money is just printed paper or that 1600 is just a score on the SATs. Humans invent stuff and give it meaning.
Some of the shock of aging dulls. Forty felt new-old. By 50 you're used to being middle-aged, though you suspect the next decade will speed by even more quickly than the last one did. When I met a tour group of retirees recently, I suddenly realized that some weren't much older than me. The real problem with 50 isn't 50, it's that 60 comes next.
Old problems are replaced by new ones. For my 40th birthday I threw an aspirational party and invited people I thought should be my friends but who barely knew me. They wondered why they were there. For my 50th, I vowed not to make the same mistake. I phoned a few actual friends to invite them over but refused to disclose how old I'd be. "Alexa, how old is Pamela Druckerman?" one shouted into his house. He had the answer in seconds.
I needn't have said anything; I ended up canceling the party because of the pandemic. To be honest, I'm relieved. Maybe I don't have to turn 50 after all.

Emergency Bill Intended to Shore Up a Safety Net for Families and Workers

Texto completo: The package includes free coronavirus testing for all, but its two weeks of paid sick don't apply to many workers. The Senate is expected to take up the measure early next week.
WASHINGTON -- The House passed an emergency relief package Saturday to address the sweeping effects of the coronavirus and cushion the economic blow to the most vulnerable Americans.
The legislation includes a series of measures intended to bolster the safety net for families and workers whose livelihoods and health are affected by the virus. With President Trump weighing in late to voice his approval, the Senate is expected to take up the package and could pass it as early as next week.
It is unclear how much the package will cost, because the Congressional Budget Office, the independent federal agency that assesses the revenue effects of legislation, did not have time to calculate a price tag.
Here's what's in the package.
There is paid sick leave for workers -- but millions aren't covered.
The measure gives some workers two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave, equal to no less than two-thirds of their pay. The provision is aimed at encouraging people to follow the advice of public health officials who have said the best way to contain the spread of the virus is to have anyone experiencing symptoms stay at home.
But those benefits only apply to employees of businesses with fewer than 500 employees, or the government, who are infected by the virus, quarantined, have a sick family member or are affected by school closings. Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50 employees, if it determines that providing paid leave "would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern."
Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus. Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)
The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some public health experts have called for -- effectively paying any worker to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.
It also excludes "certain health care providers and emergency responders" from the benefit.
Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave. The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the outbreak.
The paid leave provisions were among the most contentious elements of the legislation. Republicans objected to a proposal by Democrats to establish a permanent paid sick leave entitlement for all families, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private negotiations.
The provision would expire in a year, at the insistence of Republicans, and exemptions are available for small businesses.
It allows for free coronavirus testing for all, including the uninsured.
As the White House moved on Friday to catch up with the surging demand for coronavirus testing, Ms. Pelosi emphasized that "testing, testing, testing" would be the centerpiece of the legislation.
The final package includes a number of waivers to allow the costs of tests to be covered by insurance and federal government programs. It also includes a 6.2-percentage point increase in federal payments to Medicaid for states.
There is also $ 64 million for the Indian Health Service to cover the costs of coronavirus diagnostic testing for members of federally recognized Native American tribes. The Department of Veterans Affairs would receive $ 60 million to provide testing for veterans, while the National Disaster Medical System would receive $ 1 billion to reimburse the costs of testing and services to people without health insurance.
The package increases funding food assistance programs.
The bill includes about $ 1 billion for food security programs aimed at helping those who may struggle to get access to meals during the pandemic, including those who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, food banks, and the 22 million children who receive free or reduced-price lunch at school.
Those new funds include $ 500 million to help provide nutritious food to low-income pregnant women or mothers with young children who lose their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and $ 400 million to help local food banks purchase, store and distribute food. There is also $ 100 million to provide nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands and $ 250 million to provide additional home-delivered and prepackaged meals to low-income seniors who rely on federal programs.
The legislation allows for emergency food assistance to households with children who would receive free or reduced-price meals in school if they close for five days or longer.
Democrats also included language that bars the administration from pushing ahead with tougher work requirements for food stamps beginning on April 1. Under the package, the work and work training requirements for SNAP would be suspended during the coronavirus pandemic.
It strengthens unemployment insurance benefits.
The legislation provides $ 1 billion in 2020 for emergency grants to states to assist with processing and paying unemployment insurance.
Half of those funds would be used to provide immediate additional funding to all states for staffing, technology and other administrative costs. The other half would be used for emergency grants to states that experienced at least a 10-percent increase in unemployment.

Texto completo: The Music Issue, out on March 15, introduces a multimedia experience that bridges print and digital through your smartphone.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
This weekend, readers who pick up a print copy of The New York Times Magazine will be able to have a novel multimedia experience.
Using their smartphones, they can point to an article in the magazine's special music issue, "25 Songs That Matter Now," and listen to the song mentioned in that article at the same time.
The interactive technology that brings those pages to life has been used by the magazine for its covers, but this is the first time it's ever been used for an entire issue, immersing readers in its pages.
"That was an experience that didn't exist for print readers," Blake Wilson, the digital director of the magazine, said.
It works like this. Download the Google app on your phone and then click on the Google Lens tool -- it's the squarish icon to the left of the microphone icon. Then, for example, if you want to listen to Lizzo's "Truth Hurts" while reading Danyel Smith's essay about the song, you can point the camera at the page and tap on a link to the song on Spotify. (You'll find directions in the magazine, too.)
The Lens tool can also be used to find a print article online and share it with a friend, explore related stories on The New York Times app or see a subject jump off the page through fun multimedia like looping animated videos. Hover the phone's camera over a photo of the singer-songwriter King Princess, and the image on the screen will transform into a photo sequence of her twirling in the sun.
"The Times is always looking for new and innovative ways for readers to interact with our journalism and make it a more valuable part of their lives," said Dan Sanchez, an editor for emerging platforms. "Part of that means experimenting with new technologies and new formats."
The interactivity in this issue was about a year in the making. The Times's Special Projects team began by brainstorming how to incorporate visual search into the newsroom's journalism. Visual search technology allows users to point their smartphone cameras at anything in the real world and instantly get search results based on what the app processes -- it's as if you're doing a Google search of what you see. The team turned its focus to Google Lens, a tool with various uses, like translating text in real time and researching a product while shopping, and started exploring how the application could enhance the print reading experience.
The Special Projects desk worked with the Research and Development department to create internal tools that can instantly associate a print page with digital content using the Lens feature, making it easier for editors across the newsroom to apply it to their work. Without that step, each project would require hours of coding.
The magazine first used this technology in its Dec. 22 issue. When pointed at the cover, the tool instantly directs print readers to the online video series "Behind the Cover," in which Jake Silverstein, the editor in chief of the magazine, and Gail Bichler, the design director, explain their creative process.
The music issue is the first time the tool has been integrated into nearly every page of the magazine, starting with the cover. The issue has three different covers, featuring Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X and Megan Thee Stallion. If you use the Lens tool on one cover, it will appear on your screen as an animation that shows all three.
Planning how the visuals will appear in print, on the web and on Google Lens required collaboration among print and digital designers, art directors, photo editors, a photographer and an external design studio.
That collective effort also led to an online package that, like the print edition, bursts with multimedia: Essays appear against a backdrop of portraits, illustrations and cinemagraphs -- a hybrid of still photos and video that contain subtle motion and play in a short loop. Readers can scroll down and automatically listen to snippets of those 25 songs, or click on a bar to find the full tracks on Spotify.
The magazine and special projects team plan on fully integrating at least two more issues with Google Lens, Mr. Sanchez said.
One goal is to ensure that print readers can experience "that really special multimedia or digital content that we provide online, and that they get a portal into the breadth of our report," he said.
Another hope, Mr. Wilson said, is to experiment and imagine how people will read print magazines in the future.
The music issue, he said, "is just a great sandbox to play around in."

Texto completo: The statement came more than 12 hours after the White House physician released a statement saying that because the president had no symptoms, a test was not necessary.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician said on Saturday, a week after having contact with multiple people who days later tested positive for the virus.
"This evening, I received confirmation that the test is negative," the physician, Sean P. Conley, said in a statement. "The president remains symptom free."
The announcement capped a week of uncertainty about the status of Mr. Trump's health, as he decided not to quarantine himself and shook hands with chief executives who visited the White House and held meetings with administration officials working in the West Wing.
And it was greeted with immediate skepticism from Mr. Trump's critics, serving as the latest reminder of how the president is squandering the credibility he needs in a moment of national emergency -- especially when it comes to his health.
Mr. Trump revealed earlier in the day that he had been tested and was awaiting results, a little more than 12 hours after the White House physician said that because the president had no symptoms, a test was not necessary.
The result was released hours after Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said she was quarantining at home and awaiting results after experiencing flulike symptoms. Ms. McDaniel had attended a fund-raising event last Friday night at Mar-a-Lago, where she introduced Mr. Trump.
On Saturday, Mr. Trump's almost casual admission at a White House news conference of his decision to get tested -- not because of his interactions with Brazilian officials who later tested positive for the virus, but because of news media coverage -- raised more questions than it answered.
Mr. Conley issued a letter at 11:55 p.m. on Friday acknowledging that while the president interacted with at least two people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, he was not recommending home quarantine, and "testing for Covid-19 is not currently indicated."
It was unclear if Mr. Trump took the test after the letter was released, or if Dr. Conley's letter was a falsehood, or if the physician was misleading in his formulation that a test for the president was "not currently indicated" -- which did not say directly whether Mr. Trump had been tested.
In his follow-up statement on Saturday, Dr. Conley said that on Friday night, "after an in-depth discussion with the president regarding Covid-19 testing, he elected to proceed."
"I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday," Mr. Trump said on Saturday. At his news conference in the Rose Garden a day earlier, the president was pressed repeatedly about whether he would be tested after interacting with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after the two men met in Florida. "People were asking, did I take the test," he said.
A clip of Mr. Trump being pressed on the matter played repeatedly on cable news, and appeared to influence his decision to take one.
Mr. Trump left the briefing room before reporters could ask follow-up questions, but the president said that he had taken his temperature and described it as "totally normal."
Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Trump took the test before or after the release of Dr. Conley's letter, or why Mr. Trump would have taken a test in spite of the advice of his doctor.
On Friday, Mr. Trump's advice to Americans watching his news conference was that "they shouldn't be jumping to get the test unless it's necessary," adding that "but I think they have to listen to their doctors."
A senior administration official said only that while testing was not necessary, Mr. Trump "requested the test, and it was his decision to make his personal medical test public."
Mr. Trump's test took many officials by surprise. Vice President Mike Pence, a senior administration official said, learned only on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had been tested. At the news conference, Mr. Pence was left to handle questions about the president's decision, some of which he did not appear to know how to answer.
Mr. Pence also indicated that he might soon follow the president's lead. "I'm going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician's office," he told reporters. The physician, he said, had previously advised him that he did not need testing.
Mr. Trump, who sees strength as the most important quality someone can project, has often equated illness with weakness. Over the past week, he had resisted testing, disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has recommended tests and self-quarantine for anyone who has stood next to someone who had tested positive.
Despite having the imprimatur of the highest level of American government, Dr. Conley's decision not to recommend a test for Mr. Trump, or any sort of isolation, was at odds with the advice of other physicians, as well as medical experts on the administration's own coronavirus task force.
The standard protocol is to ask people exposed to a known coronavirus case to stay home, to monitor their own health and to refrain from their regular activities for 14 days, and to get tested if they develop symptoms, said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
As a head of state leading the nation through a turbulent time, the president has a singular responsibility to safeguard his health, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. By letting a week go by before agreeing to a test, Mr. Gostin said, Mr. Trump "gives exactly the wrong message to the public, and puts himself and his cabinet at risk."
But that decision was in line with the course of action Mr. Trump preferred -- avoiding a test whose results could make him face a reality he might not want to acknowledge. It also followed a pattern of Mr. Trump's career in politics: releasing memos and statements from medical professionals who are willing to say whatever he wants them to say about his health. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, Mr. Trump's personal physician during the 2016 presidential campaign, later admitted that a flattering doctor's letter he had released was dictated to him verbatim by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump, some experts noted on Saturday, has still never released any details on an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center he took in November. Dr. Conley at the time described it vaguely as an "interim checkup," but Mr. Trump has been unclear about his follow-up plans for a full physical examination.
Whether Mr. Trump had been exposed to the coronavirus has been a subject of furtive discussion among some of his advisers, even before his dinner with President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, whose aides later tested positive. Some have been watching for hints in his affect or physical appearance to determine whether he is feeling ill and they are relieved by the negative test result.
Mr. Trump, they said, would be unlikely to want to admit feeling under the weather. During the 2016 presidential campaign, when Mr. Trump was battling a cold, aides declined to confirm anything was amiss about his health. People close to Mr. Trump said it was in character for the president to initially decline to submit to testing for an illness that he had played down for weeks.

Texto completo: Content moderators are essential gatekeepers, but also our greeters, paramedics, law enforcers, teachers and curators.
Most of the internet is made of comments. Some are like the old-fashioned ones you can see accompanying this article online, but others take the form of memes, gamer live-streams, or even breaking news from people on the ground at a disaster scene.
And yet, the more ubiquitous comments are, the more that tech companies treat them like the detritus of the internet -- little more than raw data to be mined and analyzed for political candidates or marketers, or mechanically sorted by algorithms for posting or rejecting.
It doesn't have to be this way. In all these efforts to process comments in various ways, we've lost sight of one of the most crucial jobs created by the internet economy: the moderator.
We need to put human moderators back at the center of our social media, where they belong. But to do it, we'll need to acknowledge what moderators have already done, and what the job actually involves.
[What are your thoughts on the role of comments on the internet? What has your experience been commenting online? Tell us about it in the (ahem) comments.]
"Moderator" became a tech job in the early 2000s, right around the time when people started joking, "Never read the comments," because they were so unbearable. Companies hired moderators to prevent abuse, report illegal content to law enforcement, ban commenters who broke the rules and generally keep the peace.
But the gig was more than that. Jessamyn West, a librarian who was a moderator for 10 years at MetaFilter, said the job is like what Catskill entertainers of the mid-20th century called a tummler, "the person in the room who isn't quite the M.C. but walks around and makes sure you're doing OK." Tummlers were basically professional minglers at shows and social gatherings. If you were feeling shy, they'd even help you strike up a conversation with other vacationers at the resort.
Then, as the number of commenters soared, behemoth platforms like Facebook and YouTube had a tough time scaling up the tummler model. They also needed a new kind of moderator, one who was more like a paramedic than a social director.
These moderators are the people who review abuse complaints, usually on posts that have been flagged by users. Like paramedics in real life, they see a lot of things they wish they could unsee. Sarah T. Roberts, an information studies professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, has interviewed moderators who report spending days at a time looking at videos of animal torture, child abuse and worse. In her recent book, "Behind the Screen," she found that moderators suffer traumas that are very similar to those felt by rescue workers at a disaster scene.
To cope, some companies have tried to replace human moderators with algorithms. The results have been mixed at best. Some of the most high-profile failures were at Facebook, where algorithms censored archaeological images showing a 30,000 year-old nude figurine, while allowing live video of suicides to circulate widely. Facebook promised last year to hire thousands of human moderators -- and, in some cases, to provide them with trauma therapy.
Those are good first steps for disaster-response moderation, but we also need to revive what Ms. West called the tummler part of the job. It's a tough gig, but it can be done. Especially if companies admit that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for moderation.
This is why human moderators are so valuable: they can understand what's important to the community they're moderating. On the Reddit forum r/science, for example, moderators will delete posts that aren't based on peer-reviewed scientific research. And on the fan-fiction forum An Archive of Our Own, where many people prefer to post stories under pseudonyms, members can be banned for revealing the legal names of another member.
A well-trained moderator enforces these rules not just to delete abuse, but also to build up a unique community. At AO3, for example, there is a class of moderator called a "tag wrangler," whose job is to make sure stories are labeled properly for users who don't want "Iron Man" fic mixed in with "Iron Giant" fic. Or "Iron Chef"! The forum is also recruiting bilingual moderators who can answer questions and post items of interest for its growing community on Weibo, China's most popular microblogging site.
Monique Judge, an editor at the black news site The Root, told me that she and her colleagues are inundated with racist comments. But instead of banning the commenters, or deleting their words, The Root lets them stand. "We let those stay so that people can see how ignorant they are," she said. "I feel like those comments are just our reality as black journalists. No matter what we talk about, people will say, 'Don't discuss this because you're black."'
Ms. Judge's point is that context matters. Racist comments mean one thing in The Root's community, where black perspectives are centered, and quite another on Twitter, where they are not.
Moderators aren't the only ones responsible, though. They are effective only if they have the support of their employers. Anil Dash, a social critic and podcaster who runs the app development community Glitch, once argued, in an essay that has become a classic among moderators, that if a website's comment section is full of jerks, "It's your fault."
Now, he finds that the problem is a conflict of interest between moderators, who want to enforce the rules, and executives who want content from famous or controversial people, at any cost. "That's why Twitter hasn't banned Donald Trump from its platform," he said, even though the president has repeatedly broken Twitter's rules against posting violent threats. Moderation works only if the rules apply to everybody on a platform.
There's something just as important as banning people, Mr. Dash notes. "When you define rules of suspension, you have to make rules of reinstatement, too," he said. When Twitter and other platforms ban people, they should also tell them what they need to do to become commenters in good standing again. Perhaps they have to delete the tweet or comment that broke the rules, or apologize. The idea is a bit like restorative justice for the internet, where offenders are given a clear pathway back into their community if they choose.
Moderators are gatekeepers, but they're also the welcoming committee. As well as the paramedics, the law enforcers, the teachers and the curators. And, sometimes, they're friends. Unfortunately, no single person can be all of these things.
We need to expand the ranks of moderators, and acknowledge that the job has many subspecialities. But most of all, we can't forget why we needed moderators in the first place: They're our tummlers, helping us have a good time.

Texto completo: During my weekly visits to Kramerbooks in Washington, D.C., I can't avoid the anxiety-inducing new-arrivals section. It is filled with books laden with urgency about climate catastrophe and the collapse of liberal democracy. Now with a looming pandemic, newsworthy crises are the realm of responsible readers. But instead of partaking there, I find myself drawn to different shelves, filled with another flourishing, but quieter, genre of new releases.
I'm referring to a growing library of self-help guides for the self-care generation. Clothed in minimalist cover jackets, bathed in soft hues, these books promise calm and reprieve: "Silence: In the Age of Noise," "The Longing for Less" and "How to do Nothing." Titles that once might have disappeared in lifestyle bins are now prominently displayed among the week's bestsellers. The literature of silence is having its moment, and for this reader, it feels especially resonant.
I began my journalism career as a public radio producer, and I recall a terrifying orientation lecture about the professional liability of "dead air." Radio silence was to be avoided at all costs, and if a few seconds of blank sound sneaked onto the airwaves, emergency procedures would be initiated, and penalties could follow. Manipulating, layering and delivering noise became my medium.
More than a decade later, a little silence, any kind of silence, can seem like a blessing. With the rise of podcasting and on-demand audio, certainly there is no lack of things to listen to. Infinite conversations and chatty companions are available at any time in any place. Despite the ascent of my own medium, I've found myself overwhelmed and exhausted by this sonic boom.
I'm tempted to dismiss my growing obsession with books about silence as a frivolous longing for "chicken soup for an angsty soul." But the rise of this family of books speaks to a real need - and void - in contemporary life. Silence is more than the absence of noise. It is the cumulative experience of personal space and a mind at rest, with room to think and contemplate. For a long time, I thought I was alone in my inability to be present. I confess to a smartphone addiction and an unhealthy volume of streaming, bingeing and reading restlessness. When I bought my first guide to silence, aptly titled "Silence," by the Norwegian writer and explorer Erling Kagge, I was comforted to learn that I wasn't alone in my struggle. Kagge's book was a visual feast of hazy horizons and poetic sentences about the value of silence. "Shutting out the world is not about turning your back on your surroundings," he writes, "but rather the opposite: it is seeing the world a bit more clearly, staying a course and trying to love your life."
Two years after it was first published, "Silence" is in its eighth printing and has been translated into 37 languages. Meanwhile, similarly themed books have proliferated. New Yorker writer David Owen's "Volume Control" warns that loud noise in the modern world has become a deafening threat to our physical and emotional health, with the sound in city bars and restaurants turned up to toxic decibels by design.
The artist Jenny Odell's "How to do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy" appeared on literary influencer Barack Obama's recent list of favorite books. In her elegant tome on the dangers of Big Tech's exploitation of the "attention economy," Odell writes that "solitude, observation and simple conviviality should be recognized not only as ends in and of themselves, but inalienable rights belonging to anyone lucky enough to be alive."
Georgetown professor Cal Newport's "Digital Minimalism" provides a step-by-step guide to online withdrawal in pursuit of deeper work. And, in January, journalist Kyle Chayka published "The Longing for Less: Living With Minimalism," a travelogue through the art history of minimalism movements, including an entire section devoted to silence.
What unites these books is the authors' alarm that the sheer volume of physical, digital and political "noise" is fraying our state of mind. Some authors offer practical solutions to restoring balance; others offer more poetic ruminations. Chayka traces a geographic path to quietude, writing about the ancient Japanese city of Kyoto, where soft footsteps through rock gardens and Buddhist temples offer a seductive vision of paradise.
But fetishizing silence as a destination runs the risk of turning noise cancellation into a mere commodity. Meditation rooms and sound baths are arriving in cities, and expensive silent retreats are already a pillar of the wellness industrial complex. If silence becomes a luxury good, is it a worthwhile aspiration as these books suggest?
The quietest place I've ever lived is Germany, where sound regulations, urban forests and the occasional act of public shushing creates a different sonic landscape. I recently returned to Berlin to work on a radio documentary about my search for silence. On my first day, I was surprised to discover a mirror image of the D.C. bookstore where I began this reading project. In a small neighborhood shop, Kagge's book on silence was prominently displayed in German and English. When I later interviewed Kagge about the international success of his book, he told me, "What it says is that it's a global phenomenon, that people feel cheated by circumstances and that they really need silence in their lives." Kagge famously walked to the South Pole alone, and he said it was an unsettling experience. "Man has always been scared of silence. And the reason, of course, is because in the silence, you meet yourself, while in the noise, you live through other people. Noise will always be the easiest option."
As with most self-help books, it is impossible to live up to the prescriptions for sonic reduction. Somewhere among the discipline of abrupt digital withdrawals, walks to the South Pole and the structural blame on booming cities is the unavoidable rhythm of daily life. Each of us has a different tolerance for noise and available time for silence. But in applying small lessons from each of these books, I've discovered the possibilities lurking in the radio silence I once feared.
In choosing the book form to explore noise, these authors are making an implicit argument for reading as the ultimate gift of silence. The reader who appears quiet to the outsider knows the symphonic river of ideas and conversations that flow between the pages of a great book.
Now armed with silence as an orientation rather than a sonic condition, I find myself experiencing books, films and conversations through a new filter. I'm now inspired to spend even more time with writers that make space to think and consider rather than rattle with the noise of certitude. Given their popularity, the self-help sections devoted to silence are destined to grow with even more beautiful books to purchase. I'm learning to resist the consumption temptation and quietly practice what I've already read, and now preached.

Texto completo: How do musicals get to Broadway? Let us count the ways.
Some bow first in Chicago or San Diego or Boston or Washington, usually at venues such as Arena Stage and the National Theatre. Some move uptown from off-Broadway. A few are born on the Great White Way itself, and still others map an international route to Times Square through London or Toronto or Sydney.
Now, one will get there by way of Woolly Mammoth Theatre. Or will if the theater gods - and D.C. audiences - are smiling.
In a first for the District's singularly iconoclastic theater company, a new musical with Broadway dreams will be produced in Woolly Mammoth's D Street NW headquarters. With performances to begin Sept. 15, the show even has a New York producer who's vying for a home for it in one of Broadway's 40-odd, highly sought-after theaters.
"A Strange Loop" is the musical, by Michael R. Jackson. The lift is major for a company far more experienced in mounting envelope-pushing plays than musicals; the last time Woolly tried a tuner, company officials said, was a revival 30 years ago of a spoofy "The Rocky Horror Show."
This foray is spearheaded by Woolly's artistic director, Maria Goyanes, who emphasizes there's no attempt to turn her company into a "road house" for musicals seeking an out-of-town tryout. Rather, she argues, this is a natural extension of Woolly's pursuit of material on the leading edge of the culture.
"What's really exciting about it is that we can give resources over to that next step for Michael and Stephen," she said, referring to Jackson and director Stephen Brackett. "This isn't just putting it up to put it up. Michael really wants to work on it and refine it."
Musicals reaching Broadway seem to be diversifying in theme and style, as indicated by some of the recent Tony winners for best musical - "Hadestown," based on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, and "Fun Home," a lesbian coming-of-age story, among them - that have found enthusiastic audiences there. The avenues for landing on theater's most prominent platform are branching off more idiosyncratically, too. It was not so long ago that a musical called "Next to Normal" premiered erratically off-Broadway, went out of town to Arena Stage for significant fixes and ended up on Broadway, with a Pulitzer Prize for drama to show for it.
"It's certainly not a secret that I would be thrilled if it would go to Broadway," said Jackson, a graduate of New York University's musical theater program, who has been working on "A Strange Loop" on and off since 2001. "But there were still some things I wanted to keep working on." Tightening the script and sharpening the humor are among the priorities.

"A Strange Loop" had an inaugural run last summer at Playwrights Horizons in New York. It's a manifestly self-referential musical about a black, gay writer named Usher who works as a Broadway usher and is composing a musical about a black, gay writer named Usher who works as an usher and is composing a musical about . . . well, you get the drift. The show is a bit like staring into an M.C. Escher sketch or playing with a nest of Russian dolls, all set to show tunes. The wittily solipsistic premise extends to the cast, made up of Usher and his Thoughts, played by six actors assuming the various attitudes and neuroses that in turn make up Usher.
Many reviewers have expressed pleasure with Jackson's irreverent intensity: Ben Brantley in the New York Times described the cheeky duality of the musical as "jubilantly anguished." Goyanes liked what she saw, too, and had reason for special satisfaction: She knew Jackson and directed an embryonic version of "A Strange Loop" in New York in the mid-2000s. Earlier this year, Goyanes got in touch with producer Barbara Whitman, who had been involved with musicals like "Next to Normal," "Fun Home" and "If/Then," and had been a driving force behind "A Strange Loop" since seeing a developmental production of it in 2016.
Whitman was open to Woolly as a next step for the musical while she waited for a Broadway house to become available. No doubt a successful run at Woolly would boost its chances with Broadway's major landlords. Also, "A Strange Loop" is unorthodox in theme and style, the type of show that might benefit from the cachet of a splash at a theater known for hipness among a younger crowd. "It gives you support for the production," Whitman said. "It gives you an educated audience who knows what they're going to see and they want to be a part of it. The audience is invested in helping you learn."
Casting has not been announced, but the musical will be a pivotal part of the first half of Woolly's 2020-21 season, which will also include co-sponsorship, with Shakespeare Theatre Company, of "The Jungle," an immersive piece from Britain that just before Labor Day will turn Sidney Harman Hall into a refugee camp for actors portraying migrants from Africa and Asia. The new roster of offerings begins July 14 with a mini-festival that the company describes as a "summer of sex and body positivity"; it will consist of two solo shows (comic Jacqueline Novak's "Get on Your Knees" and Ryan J. Haddad's "Hi, Are You Single?") and a late-night run of #TeamHusband's "Rest of Gay DC Drag Show."

Texto completo: 'MBS" is a biography with no startling revelations about the life of its subject. Yet it is a revelatory work nonetheless.
The subject is Mohammed bin Salman, the 34-year-old crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Ben Hubbard, who reports on the Middle East for the New York Times, is honest enough to say that it is "hard to paint a detailed picture of his early life," that "much still remains unclear about how MBS spent his twenties" and that, when it comes to why he was chosen for the position that makes him the likely future king, "we are left with little more than informed speculation."
There are a number of possible explanations for these gaps. One is that as a child, Mohammed hardly seemed destined for greatness. "As the sixth son of the twenty-fifth son of the founding king, there was little reason to expect that he would rise to prominence," Hubbard notes.
Second, unlike many of his royal cousins and half-siblings, Mohammed did not study abroad; his formative years were spent inside Saudi Arabia.
And third, the people in Saudi Arabia who might have tales to tell, even seemingly benign ones, are too afraid to talk. "Fear is so widespread that a stray social media post or a private comment could lead to arrest or jail," Hubbard writes, "that many Saudis avoid talking on the phone or put their devices in the fridge when they meet."
And that points to the real revelation of this book. While it may not chart the inner growth of a future leader, it paints a vivid portrait of how he has altered the kingdom during his half-decade of rule.
That evolution may surprise American readers with only a passing familiarity with Saudi Arabia. After all, they probably know that Saudi Arabia never was a democracy. It long subjugated half its population. It fostered and disseminated an intolerant form of Islam, expressed most infamously in the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.
All true - and in fact, Mohammed has modestly improved the lot of women (they are now allowed to drive) and reined in the intolerant clerics (movie theaters have opened).
But the most fundamental change the headstrong crown prince has brought about, Hubbard shows, is to turn a "soft-gloved autocracy" that featured multiple centers of power, and room for discreet grousing and dissent, into "a laboratory for a new kind of electronic authoritarianism."
"Over time, it would engage in surveillance, harassment, and kidnapping of Saudi citizens overseas, as well as their detention and sometimes torture inside palaces belonging to MBS and his father," Hubbard writes. By the time he finishes writing this book, he realizes that "something fundamental had changed in Saudi Arabia."
Hubbard describes how Mohammed consolidated his position with gangster tactics straight out of the playbook of Stalin and his secret police chief, Lavrentiy Beria. He locked his own mother away. He took the prime minister of Lebanon hostage. In 2017, he engineered a soft coup against his older cousin, the respected counterterrorism chief Mohammed bin Nayef, whom Mohammed's elderly and probably ailing father, King Salman, had installed as first crown prince. Just this month, that soft coup turned harder when Mohammed bin Nayef was arrested.
Mohammed informed a leading construction company that he wanted to become a partner. When the brothers who ran the firm resisted, the government took their homes, private jets, jewelry, cash and "one brother's $90 million car collection."
In 2017 Mohammed infamously rounded up dozens of Saudi Arabia's leading princes and business executives, confined them in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and held many of them prisoner for months. Accused of corruption, they were to enjoy "independent judicial process," the kingdom's public prosecutor announced. In fact their ordeal is shrouded to this day, though it is believed that some were tortured, some remain under house arrest and most were forced to turn over assets according to some formula that was never explained - to the tune of more than $100 billion.
Not incidentally, that episode, which consolidated Mohammed's unchallenged dictatorial rule, won the enthusiastic approval of President Trump. "Some of those they are harshly treating have been 'milking' their country for years!" Trump tweeted.
Trump's admiration for Mohammed, and the crown prince's chummy relations with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, are a running theme of the book. President Barack Obama was reluctant to be drawn into what he saw as Saudi Arabia's sectarian war against Iran, and he tried to maintain some distance between the United States and Saudi Arabia despite their alliance. Trump and Kushner, by contrast, supported one reckless MBS action after another: the Ritz-Carlton purge, an attempt to isolate Qatar and - most destructively - Mohammed's disastrous and bloody intervention in the Yemen war. And that MBS recklessness was on fully display again as, in the midst of a global health crisis, he initiated a destabilizing price war against Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Trump's willingness to excuse absolutely any behavior reached its low point when he forgave Mohammed for the crime that also serves as the climax of Hubbard's book: the murder and dismemberment of Saudi exile turned Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
Most of the world is not so forgiving, Hubbard maintains, pointing to congressional disgust and the likelihood that Mohammed could no longer stage the kind of triumphant trips through the West that he engineered shortly after taking power.
"Khashoggi's killing was a wake-up call," he writes. "Sure, Khashoggi was only one man, but the contrast between his reasoned criticism and his gruesome end caught the world's attention."
Hubbard acknowledges that even if the revulsion lingers, its effects may dissipate. The world is likely to continue working with the crown prince as long as he stays in power. So the real question will be "whether MBS is learning from his mistakes. Are his dangerous acts the youthful faults of an inexperienced ruler? Or do they spring from deep in his character and serve as harbingers of things to come?"
"MBS" does not attempt a definitive answer. But it does not leave a reader optimistic that the crown prince will mature into a wise or humane king.

Texto completo: Rachel Maddow, 46, has hosted "The Rachel Maddow Show" weeknights on MSNBC since 2008. Her latest book, "Blowout," debuted in October at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. She and her partner, Susan Mikula, live in New York and Massachusetts.
You have a highly rated nightly news show, your new book, "Blowout," was a bestseller and your podcast, "Bag Man," just won an award. As a journalist, I find all of that success very annoying. Ha! Points for honesty. Well done.
Why aren't you exhausted? I am! I am a catastrophe. I'm [worried] I will have a herniated disc collapse while I'm on the air. And I'm only 46!
Has President Trump been the president you expected him to be? Yeah, I think so. I didn't have much awareness of him as a public figure before he was running. But once he was running, given the sort of recurring dynamic in the campaign - where his opponents and observers and the sort of graybeards of our democracy would identify a place where you're really not supposed to go, and as soon as that was identified, he would instantly go there - I saw that as a template. And so I have sort of expected all along that there really isn't any line that you can draw in terms of hurting the country or defying the Constitution or defying norms and mores in terms of what we think our civic life is supposed to be. I can't imagine anything that Trump wouldn't do. It doesn't seem to me like there's a line that he wouldn't cross. And so, yeah, I think it's just going to get worse and worse.
You've had critics who say you're too obsessed with Russia and you see malfeasance in all of Russia's actions. What's your response to that? I don't worry about that kind of criticism very much. I don't really worry about any kind of criticism too much. I don't have time. I do feel like I was aggressive in covering the Russian interference in our 2016 election. If you go back during the election, like, when the RNC platform toward Ukraine and Russia got changed, I was one of the only people who put that on TV. And when it came to, you know, [Paul] Manafort as a strange addition to a Republican nominee's campaign, given his previous work for a pro-Kremlin kleptocratic pseudo-dictator who had escaped from office and had escaped to Moscow to avoid the angry mobs in the street, like, I covered that stuff as it was happening. Not more aggressively, but maybe with more interest than other people at the time. And that's just simply a product of my news judgment.
What about you comes across on television that isn't representative of what you're like off-air? I have better posture on television. [Laughs.] Which is literally true and actually a very consequential thing in my life now because I have a terrible back. You know, 12-hour days, five days a week has a way of destroying one's spinal column. I never wear makeup in my real life. And I think I cover electoral politics on TV a lot more than I am interested in it as a private citizen. Not to say that I'm not interested in electoral politics, but I think the news, particularly right now, is so driven by federal electoral politics that it would be remiss to not be covering it as much as I do. The way my partner, Susan, talks about this, she says it is the real me on television, but it's just a slice of me. It's the real me. It's just not the whole me.
Is it better to be the interviewer or the interviewee? Being the interviewee is one of my least favorite things in the whole world. You are a very nice person, but I would prefer almost anything to this.

Texto completo: As of 5:30 p.m. Saturday, March 14, three Maine residents have tested presumptive positive for the coronavirus, according to the state.
Here's a roundup of today's COVID-19 news in Maine and New England, as of 7 p.m. To read all of our coverage, click here.
-- Another Mainer has a presumptive positive test for the new coronavirus, state health officials said on Saturday.
-- The state's third presumptive positive case appeared in a woman in her 40s from Cumberland County. She had close household contact with another person with a presumptive positive test for the virus, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.
-- Two test results from a private lab also came back positive today, but have not been confirmed by the CDC. Those so-called "preliminary presumptive positive" cases came from a lab affiliated with MaineHealth. There are now three such cases in Maine.
-- John Bapst Memorial High School was the first Bangor area school to close after two Mainers tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the week. All on-campus classes are suspended and the building will be closed until April 27.
-- Shortly afterward, the Bangor School Department announced it will close for two weeks beginning Monday.
-- As more school cancellations come in, we'll be gathering them here. You can also find the latest information regarding business closures, religious service cancellations, sports suspensions and event postponements.
-- Internet, wireless, cable, water and other companies say they are suspending shutoffs for nonpayment during the coronavirus outbreak, with some adding extra services to help Mainers get by.
-- Central Maine Healthcare officials said Saturday that the three-hospital system is postponing some elective surgeries and limiting access to buildings starting on March 16.
-- An elementary school student in Rhode Island tested positive for the coronavirus after getting an autograph from Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert.
-- President Donald Trump said Saturday that he was tested for the coronavirus as the White House stepped up precautions after his direct and indirect exposures to COVID-19.
-- He also announced Saturday that the United States will broaden its European travel ban, adding the United Kingdom and Ireland to its list.
-- Spain locked down its 46 million citizens Saturday and France ordered the closing of the Eiffel Tower as governments took increasingly desperate measures to put more space between people and contain the coronavirus.
-- The BDN has been compiling questions about the coronavirus submitted by our readers. You can find the answers to those questions here.
-- The Maine CDC set up a coronavirus hotline. The hotline is available by calling 211 or 1-866-811-5695. It can also be reached by texting your zipcode to 898-211 or emailing info@211maine.org.
-- Throughout the rest of New England, Massachusetts has 138 confirmed cases, Rhode Island has 20, Connecticut has 11, New Hampshire has seven, and Vermont has four.
-- Nationwide, there are 2,443 cases and 50 deaths from the coronavirus as of Thursday evening, according to The New York Times.

Is Biden is mentally fit to be president?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — After a disastrous performance in his first debate with Walter Mondale, many in the media began to openly question the then-73-year-old Ronald Reagan’s mental fitness.
Writing in The New York Times, James Reston pointed out that Reagan “got his figures mixed up, and didn’t seem to be mentally alert in dealing with Mr. Mondale’s arguments.” The Wall Street Journal noted that “the president’s rambling responses and occasional apparent confusion injected an unpredictable new element into the race” and pointed out that at age 75, “10% of people suffer from significant mental impairment — senile dementia, or senility.” The networks ran montages of Reagan stumbling over his words and brought on doctors to discuss the effects of aging on mental capacity.
When the second debate came around, Reagan put the aging question to rest with his now famous line: “I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” A decade later, Reagan announced to the world that he had Alzheimer’s disease.
Joe Biden is 77, four years older than Reagan was during the 1984 campaign. If Biden is elected, he’ll be older on the day he takes office than Reagan was on the day he left office. So yes, his mental fitness is a legitimate issue.
There is plenty of cause for concern. Biden recently announced “I think we can win back the House” and promised to ban the “AR-14.” He mistook Super Tuesday for “Super Thursday,” and forgot the words of the Declaration of Independence, saying “We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created, by the, you know, you know the thing.”
In South Carolina, he misstated what office he was running for, declaring “My name’s Joe Biden. I’m a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.” On three occasions last month, Biden declared he was arrested in South Africa trying to visit Nelson Mandela in prison — an incident his campaign later admitted never happened.
He earlier described meeting a Navy captain in Afghanistan, but The Washington Post reported that “almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect.” He claimed to have worked with Chinese leader “Deng Xiaoping” on the Paris Climate Accord (Deng died in 1997). He claimed during a debate that “150 million people have been killed [by guns] since 2007” (which would be nearly half the U.S. population). He said he met with Parkland victims while he was vice president, even though the shooting took place after he left office.
He has declared that Democrats should “choose truth over facts” and that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.” He pledged to use biofuels to power “steamships.” He repeatedly gets confused about what state he is in; called “Fox News Sunday” anchor Chris Wallace “Chuck”; said his late son Beau “was the attorney general of the United States”; and confused former British Prime Minister Theresa May with the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Any one of these gaffes in isolation would be nothing more than that. But taken together they form a pattern — and raise questions about whether Biden has experienced a cognitive decline. Biden’s defenders say this is unfair, and some have even suggested raising it is ageism. No, it’s not. His socialist rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is 78 — almost a year older than Biden — yet no one is questioning his mental fitness. On Monday night, Sanders spent an hour at a Fox News town hall where he was challenged to defend his policies and answered in great detail and without any gaffes or senior moments. Could Biden do the same?
Many of President Trump’s critics have suggested that he suffers from cognitive impairment. Well, in 2018, Trump took a test designed to screen for dementia — the Montreal Cognitive Assessment — and the White House physician reported he received a perfect score. Will Biden submit to the same test?
Sanders took a subtle dig at Biden during the town hall, pointing out that while he speaks for 45 minutes to an hour at his campaign events, Biden recently spoke for seven minutes. The two men will have their first mano-a-mano debate on Sunday. How will Biden perform over the course of a two-hour discussion? Perhaps he will put concerns about his mental fitness to rest. This much is certain: Democrats are about to pick a man they hope will be the first octogenarian president in American history. It is fair to ask whether voters are choosing a candidate who’s not up to the job.

Texto completo: President Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House announced Saturday evening.
Sean Conley, the physician to the president, said in a memo, "This evening I received confirmation that the test is negative." The information was released with Trump's permission, Conley said.
Trump told reporters earlier in the day in the White House briefing room that he took a coronavirus test on Friday night and was awaiting results.
The president began facing questions about taking a test for the coronavirus after it was revealed that an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, with whom Trump came into close contact last weekend, later tested positive for COVID-19.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Thursday that neither Trump nor Vice President Mike Pence would "require" testing for COVID-19 after meeting with the Brazilian delegation at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
In making her case, Grisham said the president did not have an extended interaction with Brazilian press secretary Fabio Wajngarten, who tested positive for the illness.
WH physician letter coronavirus
Both Wajngarten and Bolsonaro attended a dinner with Trump and Pence at the resort in South Florida, taking several photographs with them. Reports on Friday said Bolsonaro tested positive for the virus, but the Brazilian president, along with his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, denied the "fake news" reports and said he tested negative.
"One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free. I have been in daily contact with the CDC and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging the supplementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation," Conley wrote in his memo Saturday.
During the White House Coronavirus Task Force news briefing Saturday afternoon, Pence said he had not yet been tested.
“I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician’s office,” Pence said. “Mrs. Pence and I would be more than happy to be tested.”
Two lawmakers opted to quarantine themselves as a precautionary measure after being in close proximity to Wajngarten at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort last weekend. They were Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rick Scott of Florida.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that people may exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 two to 14 days after being infected.
Nearly 153,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,700 people, according to the New York Times. In the United States, there are more than 2,400 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed at least 50 people.

Texto completo: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio advocated for nationalizing certain industries to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.
While appearing on MSNBC's AM Joy, host Joy Reid asked de Blasio how someone in New York City should go about getting tested during the growing COVID-19 pandemic.
"People can get tested according to a priority structure, and it's not enough testing. It's just as simple as that," de Blasio said, later claiming that the city has been "pleading" with the federal government for additional testing. "Here's the reality. This is a war-like situation. We're in a wartime scenario with a 'Mar-a-Lago attitude' being used by the federal government, right?"
And after de Blasio blamed the shortcomings of the federal government for the decreased supply of testing kits and ventilators, he called for the federal government to nationalize "crucial factories and industries."
"This is a case for a nationalization, literally a nationalization, of crucial factories and industries that could produce the medical supplies to prepare this country for what we need."
Reid then asked the New York City mayor about his city's successful program to develop hand sanitizer for members of the public who need it: "Is it true that we're having hand sanitizer now made in New York?"
"The state has found a way to make it, and that's great. But the point I'm saying is the federal government should recognize this is literally a crucial part of stopping this," said de Blasio, while later adding that all factories developing certain medical supplies should be on "24/7 shifts."
Nearly 147,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,500 people, according to the New York Times. In the United States, there are nearly 2,200 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed approximately 49 people.

Texto completo: President Trump announced he took the coronavirus test on Friday night and is awaiting results.
As the White House Coronavirus Task Force gave a press conference on Saturday, Trump told reporters that he decided to take the test in response to Friday's press conference where the president declared a state of national emergency.
"By the way, I had my temperature taken coming into the room," Trump prefaced his statement to reporters. "I also took the test last night. And I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday."

After declaring a national emergency to combat the pandemic on Friday, Trump was asked by a reporter if it was "selfish" not to be tested for the coronavirus, potentially putting others at the risk of infection."I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested," he said.
"Are you going to be?" a reporter asked.
"Most likely, yeah. Most likely. Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway," the president said.
Asked when the test would happen, Trump said, "Fairly soon. We're working out a schedule."
Minutes earlier, Trump maintained there was no reason to be tested for the virus. "No, we have no symptoms whatsoever," Trump said. "We had a great meeting with the president of Brazil, Bolsonaro. Great guy, very tremendous. He's doing a fantastic job for Brazil," he said. "And, as you know, he tested negative, meaning nothing wrong, this morning. And we got that word, too."
In a White House statement released Friday, Dr. Sean Conley said that since the president has not exhibited any symptoms related to the growing COVID-19 pandemic, neither quarantining nor testing is "currently indicated." However, Conley would "closely monitor and care for the President."
"Last weekend, while hosting the Brazilian delegation at Mar-a-Lago, the President briefly came in contact with an individual who 3 days later began showing symptoms and was subsequently confirmed to have COVID-19. This evening we learned of another dinner guest, this one sharing the table with the President and White House Delegation," Conley said at the time, prefacing his conclusion.
"These interactions would be categorized as LOW risk for transmission per CDC guidelines, and as such, there is no indication for home quarantine at this time. Additionally, given the President himself remains without symptoms, testing for COVID-19 is not currently indicated," he continued, though he did not mention Trump was undergoing the test.
Nearly 147,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,500 people, according to the New York Times. In the United States, there are nearly 2,200 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed approximately 49 people.

Texto completo: RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is self-quarantining while she awaits results from a coronavirus test.
"Last night, Chairwoman McDaniel began experiencing a fever and flu like symptoms, and she went to her local hospital in Michigan for treatment," said RNC Communications Director Michael Ahrens in a statement on Saturday, later saying McDaniel tested negative for both flu and strep.
"Her doctor determined a test for COVID-19 was necessary given her symptoms. As she awaits the results, out of an abundance of caution, we are contacting everyone that the Chairwoman remembers coming into contact with in recent days. Upon the advice of doctors, she and her family are self-quarantining at their home," the statement continues. "We will provide an update when the test results are available."
Tweet
“The Chairwoman has been in contact with CPAC and was informed she likely did not have any direct contact with the individual," an RNC spokesperson told the Washington Examiner earlier this week, referring to McDaniel. "She is completely healthy."
McDaniel interacted with several political personalities during the Conservative Political Action Conference, including commentator Michael Knowles and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was the first to announce a cautionary quarantine after the American Conservative Union made him aware he had interacted with the attendee.
The news follows President Trump's announcement on a Saturday that he took a diagnostic test for COVID-19 on Friday night.
"By the way, I had my temperature taken coming into the room," Trump prefaced his statement to reporters. "I also took the test last night. And I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday."
Trump later noted that he anticipates results from the test within the next several days.
Nearly 147,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,500 people, according to the New York Times. In the United States, there are nearly 2,200 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed approximately 49 people.

AOC spreads disinformation to push socialism amid coronavirus panic

Texto completo: Never let a good crisis go to waste, right?
That’s apparently the philosophy of socialist upstart Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The New York Democrat is one of many who’ve sadly decided to politicize the coronavirus crisis to push their political agenda. But even worse, the congresswoman is spreading disinformation to do it.
After news broke that the Federal Reserve has decided to extend $1.5 trillion in emergency financing to banks in response to the economic fallout from the coronavirus, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the amount that the Fed just injected almost covers all student loan debt in the US.”
“There is absolutely NO excuse for not pausing student debt collections, planning for mortgage & rent relief, etc,” she continued. “We need to care for working people as much as we care for the stock market.”Tweet
This is ignorance to the point of disinformation, frankly.
What Ocasio-Cortez is suggesting is that the Federal Reserve is somehow spending $1.5 trillion in government funds and that similar levels of spending could be used to cancel all student debt in the United States. But this is false, and completely distorts the action the central bank is taking.
Brookings Institution fellow and New York Times writer Justin Wolfers (an economist whose credentials don’t exactly scream right-wing hack) called this type of comparison “horseshit,” pointing out that “the Fed’s short term loans cost us nothing when they’re all repaid the next day.”
Writing for National Review, Daniel Teneiro explained:
The Fed is not cutting a check to financial institutions. It is engaging in short-term transactions with banks to ensure financial stability. If the Fed bought your house today and sold it back to you tomorrow, it wouldn’t be doing you a huge favor. The Fed’s intervention in the repo market, while a boon to the U.S. financial system, is far from a handout.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Richard Morrison told Fox News that “the Fed is lending to banks and strategically purchasing assets, not handing over bailout payments to anyone. AOC’s comparison to student loan payment is inapt.”
Remember, Ocasio-Cortez holds a degree in economics from Boston University. She really ought to know better. (Or she should ask for a refund.)
She is, of course, free to advocate for student loan bailouts and the rest of the “Green New Deal” socialist agenda. But shame on the congresswoman for spreading disinformation to do it.

Democratic congresswoman calls for 'remote voting' during coronavirus outbreak

Texto completo: A California Democratic representative is calling on Congress to permit "remote voting" in the event that the coronavirus limits state-to-state travel.
While appearing on CNN's Cuomo Primetime, California Rep. Katie Porter said it's incumbent on Congress to adopt a voting policy which would allow members to vote on measures even if they are not physically present in the chamber.
“We’re asking the American people to adopt public health measures, and it’s really important that Congress not only pass this bill, but that Congress adopt public health measures itself," Porter said. "Congress itself has been flat-footed itself during this crisis in terms of how we deal with things."
“I am calling on Congress tonight, on leaders of both parties, to adopt a remote-voting procedure to ensure that if we’re not able to travel, if this public health crisis worsens, that we're still able to have a quorum and we're still able to take votes,” Porter continued.
Cuomo pushed back on the legality of such a measure, asking if she anticipates any pushback by others should such a measure be proposed.
“You’re the law professor. What’s going to be the pushback about why they don’t usually allow remote votes? You know, we have seen that in the past, where people are sick: ‘Will he or she be able to make it back in time?’ What’s going to be the legal pushback? And how do you overcome it?”
“There is no legal barrier, that I am aware of, to remote voting,” Porter claimed.
“It could be adopted tonight, this evening, as part of an updated rules package in the House and then could be invoked if necessary. I represent the state of California. People there are worried. We have had outbreaks there. I answered the phone in my office this morning and talked firsthand to constituents about what’s going on. But those constituents are also counting on me to cast those votes.”
Porter then claimed President Trump is considering restricting interstate travel to and from California and Washington, which would necessitate the adoption of "remote voting." However, it remains unclear how the process would be adopted in Congress.
Nearly 147,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,500 people, according to the New York Times. In the United States, there are nearly 2,200 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed approximately 49 people.

After declaring a national emergency to combat the pandemic on Thursday, Trump was asked by a reporter if it was "selfish" not to be tested for the coronavirus, potentially putting others at the risk of infection.
"I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested," he said.
"Are you going to be?" a reporter asked.

Great guy, very tremendous. He's doing a fantastic job for Brazil," he said. "And, as you know, he tested negative, meaning nothing wrong, this morning. And we got that word, too."
During a Friday interview before Trump's announcement, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he recommended a coronavirus test for anybody who interacted with a carrier of the virus.
"Generally speaking, if I were standing next to someone who had been diagnosed with coronavirus, should I isolate myself and find a test as well?” asked MSNBC host Willie Geist. "Yes," Fauci said.
“OK, so that goes for the president, likely, in theory, at least, but you’ll leave it to his doctor?” Geist asked Fauci.
“I’m going to leave it to his physician, who’s a very good physician,” Fauci added.
Other administration officials, including Ivanka Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, have also been exposed to people who tested positive for the coronavirus. Peter Dutton, the Australian minister for foreign affairs, interacted with them at a gathering last week.
CNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Friday that Ivanka Trump had "worked from home," though she did not require testing because she did not exhibit any symptoms.
Nearly 147,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,500 people, according to the New York Times. In the United States, there are nearly 2,200 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed approximately 49 people.

Texto completo: Apple is shutting down almost all of its retail stores around the world for a brief time because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Silicon Valley technology company said in a statement on Friday that it would temporarily close down all stores outside of China for two weeks.
"We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27. We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement on Friday.
"In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. That means team members should work remotely if their job allows, and those whose work requires them to be on site should follow guidance to maximize interpersonal space. Extensive, deep cleaning will continue at all sites. In all our offices, we are rolling out new health screenings and temperature checks," Cook said.
The statement also read, "As of today, all of our stores in Greater China have reopened. I also want to thank our operations team and partners for their remarkable efforts to restore our supply chain."
The company also updated its policies to afford employees greater paid leave opportunities for those affected by illness.
"All of our hourly workers will continue to receive pay in alignment with business as usual operations. We have expanded our leave policies to accommodate personal or family health circumstances created by COVID-19 — including recovering from an illness, caring for a sick loved one, mandatory quarantining, or childcare challenges due to school closures," Cook said.
Last week, Apple advised 12,000 employees in Cupertino, California, to work from home, describing it as an “additional precaution.” Apple afforded the option to its employees in Santa Clara County, where the company has two main headquarters, and in Seattle, where the company has an engineering center. The coronavirus first appeared in the United States on the West Coast in Washington state.
The company joined other technology entities, such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., in the efforts to limit the spread of the infectious disease.
In a February announcement, Apple acknowledged the outbreak affected its supply of iPhones after many of its manufacturing facilities closed, saying "supply shortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide."
Nearly 147,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,500 people, according to the New York Times. In the U.S., there are nearly 2,200 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed approximately 49 people.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, it can cause more severe illness, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems.

Texto completo: Editor’s note: The Tribune is providing readers free access to critical local stories about the coronavirus during this time of heightened concern. See more coverage here .
Airlines around the world Thursday scrambled to cancel flights, lay off workers and reassure anxious travelers, capping a dizzying period of weeks in which bookings have evaporated and investors have lost confidence in the industry.
The latest frenzy was touched off by President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday evening that beginning Friday night, most travelers from 26 European countries would be barred from visiting the United States for 30 days, news that sent airline stocks tumbling. Shares of United Airlines and Delta Air Lines closed down by more than 20%, and American Airlines was down about 17%. Earlier, shares of the parent company of British Airways closed down 16% in London.
Already reeling from a steep decline in bookings because of the coronavirus outbreak, airlines now stand to lose millions of dollars in revenue from a dramatic decline in trans-Atlantic flights, which account for a big chunk of their business.
On Thursday, Norwegian Air, a once fast-growing discount carrier that flies to many U.S. cities, said it would temporarily lay off half of its staff and ground 40% of its long-haul flights and 25% of shorter flights.
“Suspending travel on such a broad scale will create negative consequences across the economy,” said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, an industry group. “Governments must recognize this and be ready to support” the industry.

According to the association, last year, about 200,000 flights carried passengers between the United States and the 26 countries targeted in Trump’s order, averaging about 550 flights carrying 125,000 travelers per day.
Over the next four weeks, the ban would affect more than 6,700 flights, in each direction, according to an analysis by OAG, an aviation data provider. Delta is the airline most affected, operating 17% of those flights, according to OAG. United is next, with 14%, followed by Lufthansa, with 13%. American ranked fourth, operating about 8% of the affected flights.
Delta said that once the ban takes effect, it would temporarily suspend flights between Paris and Cincinnati, Indianapolis, North Carolina’s Raleigh/Durham and Salt Lake City. The airline will also freeze flights between Amsterdam and Orlando, Florida; Portland, Oregon; and Salt Lake City. United said it would continue to fly its existing schedule between the United States and Europe through March 19. After that, it expects to continue serving Amsterdam; Brussels; Frankfurt, Germany; Munich; Lisbon, Portugal; Paris and Zurich.
All three airlines said they would cap fares for flights between Europe and the United States. Delta said Wednesday night that it would waive change fees for all customers traveling to, from or through Europe and the United Kingdom through May.
Confusion reigned after Trump’s announcement, with frantic travelers struggling to understand the consequences of the ban, which does not apply to American citizens and permanent residents and their close relatives, and airlines racing to adjust operations on little notice. The airlines would not say publicly whether the White House had notified them of the ban before it was announced.
“This action will hit U.S. airlines, their employees, travelers and the shipping public extremely hard,” said Nicholas Calio, president of Airlines for America, an industry group. “However, we respect the need to take this unprecedented action and appreciate the administration’s commitment to facilitate travel and trade.”
But others in the industry were far more critical. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, the union representing flight attendants at 20 airlines, including United, said that the airline industry was “pretty blindsided” by Trump’s announcement.

“It created total pandemonium,” Nelson said. “Airline employees had no idea what this meant, and for some it was completely disrupting their lives. They weren’t even sure if they were going to have a job in the next 24 hours or get home.”
Among flight attendants, there is widespread fear about job losses, she added. “The trajectory that this is on right now is beyond job loss; it’s about whether or not the industry can actually operate,” Nelson said. “You can’t operate a flight when no one wants to be on it.”
Even before the ban, investors were reassessing the financial prospects of airlines, several of which have sought bankruptcy protection in the last two decades.
“The airlines are in cash preservation mode, and we fully expect to see credit facilities extended and increased in the next week,” Helane Becker, an airline analyst with Cowen, wrote in a research note Thursday. “We previously stated U.S. airline bankruptcies were unlikely and in the near-term that still remains the case BUT if bookings do not improve in the next three months things could deteriorate quickly.”
United borrowed $2 billion this week, and Delta raised $1 billion last week. American raised $500 million two weeks ago.
Travel and tourism between the United States and Europe, including areas not covered by the ban, is a business totaling roughly $130 billion annually, according to U.S. government data.
Trans-Atlantic flights accounted for about 17% of United’s 2019 passenger revenues, or $7.3 billion. For Delta, the share was 15%, or $6.3 billion, and for American it was 11%, or $4.6 billion.
European airline stocks also fell sharply. And shares of aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which has also been hurt by the grounding of the 737 Max and cuts in orders, closed down by about 18% on Thursday afternoon after dropping 18% on Wednesday.
The chief executive of Norwegian Air, Jacob Schram, said in a statement that Trump’s travel ban on European visitors “imposed further pressure on an already difficult situation.”
Last week, the International Air Transport Association estimated that the virus could wipe out as much as $113 billion in airline revenue worldwide, a forecast made before Trump’s latest travel restrictions and other limits by countries including Israel, Kuwait and Spain.
“Airlines will need emergency measures to get through this crisis,” de Juniac said Thursday, calling on governments around the world to consider extending credit to airlines or reducing taxes and other costs.
In addition to Trump’s travel ban affecting the 26 European countries that make up the Schengen Area, the State Department warned Americans that they should reconsider all international travel, the most severe caution it can offer short of “do not travel.”
At an investor conference Tuesday, the chief executives of Delta, United and American said that years of streamlining operations had prepared them to weather the effects of a crisis like the coronavirus outbreak, and experts have said that they are more ready than their global peers.
Yet, United’s president, Scott Kirby, said at the conference that the company’s net bookings to Europe were already down 100% in recent days, about half of that coming from cancellations. The airline, he said, was preparing for its worst-case scenario — a sustained decline in revenue for the rest of the year — even though it didn’t expect that to happen.
“The financial impact of our dire scenario is worse than the post-9/11 decline in demand,” he said. “We, of course, hope that it will be better, but we’re not willing to count on that.”

Texto completo: Young voters want Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee for president. But they don’t seem to want to turn out for him or at least not in the numbers he needs to win.
The youngest voters in Michigan, those 18 to 29 years old, gave the vast majority of their votes to Sanders. But at 16% of the electorate, according to exit polling, they were overwhelmed by the oldest voters, who were 20% of the electorate and gave most of their votes to Joe Biden. The next youngest voters (aged 30 to 44) also backed Sanders, 52% to 42%. But they were swamped, in turn, by the next oldest voters (aged 45 to 64) who backed Biden 62% to 26%.
The numbers were even more lopsided in Missouri, where 14% of voters were under 30 versus 31% over 65. Sanders won them with 70% of the vote. But that was no match for Biden’s 81% victory among retirement-age Democrats.
In state after state, the youngest voters have been staying home even as overall turnout skyrocketed. Youth voting was down 18% in New Hampshire, 9% in North Carolina and 20% in Texas. Obviously, this absence of young people has hindered Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic nomination, but it has also undermined his theory of electability and change, which depends on mobilizing huge numbers of people — and young people in particular — to execute a “political revolution.”
So what happened here? If young voters like Sanders so much (and they do; 52% have a “very favorable” or “somewhat favorable” view), why haven’t they turned out for him?
The first thing to say is that this relates to the larger question of perennially low youth turnout. In any given election year, the youngest adults always vote at lower rates than their older counterparts. That was true in 1972, the first national election after the 26th Amendment lowered the voting age to 18, and it was true for the 2018 midterms, when the youth share of the vote was 13% even as youth turnout more than doubled.
The traditional answer is apathy — that young voters just aren’t interested in politics or the political process, that they’re tuned out and disengaged. That’s why campaigns that want them focus so intently on energy and enthusiasm, why Sanders believed he could capture their concerns — speak to their hopes and needs — and in doing so bring them to the polls.
But what if apathy isn’t the problem? “It’s not that young people are disengaged; it’s not that they don’t care about the issues at hand; it’s just that they really struggle to follow through,” said John Holbein, an assistant professor of public policy and education at the University of Virginia and a co-author, with D. Sunshine Hillygus, of “Making Young Voters: Converting Civic Attitudes into Civic Action.”
Holbein and Hillygus find that young voters aren’t apathetic about politics and political life. Just the opposite. “By multiple metrics, most young people are politically interested and motivated,” they write. “And, despite the increased rancor in American politics, some measures find young people to be even more interested in politics in recent years than in the past.”
The issue isn’t interest, it’s structure. It is difficult to get anyone to do anything for the first time, and that is especially true for voting, which isn’t an easy process in the United States. Worse, many states are making it harder, with specific efforts to keep young people, and students in particular, away from the polls.
Last spring, for example, the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature outlawed any polling location that wasn’t open for the state’s 12-day early voting period, a move that forced a number of colleges and universities to close temporary voting sites on their campuses. Republicans in Florida, likewise, effectively banned early voting at state universities with a law requiring “sufficient non-permitted parking” at all early voting sites. That’s easy for rural and suburban locations, but it’s difficult for sites on densely constructed college campuses.
Even states that don’t target students and young people for voter suppression still require prospective voters to register if they want to cast a ballot. And that, Holbein said, is a real problem. “When you take away an arbitrary obstacle like voter registration, youth turnout goes up quite a bit.”
If you take a broader view of obstacles to the vote — if you look beyond administrative burdens like registration and voter identification — there’s the simple fact that being young is difficult. “Young people are coming into their own,” Holbein said. “They are leaving home, they are learning to be adults, and in that experience of managing their lives, voting is one of the things that falls by the wayside.”
Without experience and familiarity, young people lack the confidence to vote, to say nothing of other forms of political participation like canvassing or working the polls. They don’t think they know enough and don’t feel the kind of efficacy that drives older voters to the polls at high rates. The solution, Holbein and Hillygus argue, is comprehensive civics education that provides “knowledge and experience grounded in awareness of the factors that shape voter participation.” Young people, in other words, need to learn how to be citizens. And the extent to which we don’t teach those skills greatly depresses youth participation in politics.
Liberalizing voting laws and improving civics education are long-term projects. In the meantime, there are things a campaign like Sanders’ can do to improve youth turnout and bring those supporters to the polls. In addition to stoking interest, a campaign like Sanders’ can educate young voters about the process — not just by telling them to register, but also by walking them through the process itself and doing the work of a civics curriculum should have already done.
Voting is a habit; once people start, they tend not to stop. It may be too late for Sanders, but future youth-centered candidates might want to begin their campaigns with dedicated, practical outreach to people who want to participate but need a little help with the follow-through.
It’s possible that there is an upper limit to youth turnout, that at a certain point the youngest Americans just aren’t going to vote at the same rates as their parents and grandparents. But we haven’t come anywhere near it. For progressives in particular, there is a lot to gain in investing as much as possible into turning interested young people into dedicated participants. The effort put into making young voters today won’t pay off just in 2020; it could pay off the next time progressives are fighting for control of the Democratic Party.

Goldberg: Debating virus terminology is a waste of energy

Texto completo: Amidst all of the well-placed urgency and occasionally misplaced panic of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have decided there’s a pressing need to debate whether terms such as “Wuhan virus” or “Chinese coronavirus” are racist.
On one side is a broad coalition that includes liberal pundits, Democratic politicians, the World Health Organization and the Chinese government.
“Calling it the ‘Chinese coronavirus’ isn’t just racist,” California Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted, “it’s dangerous and incites discrimination against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants.”
Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, says, “Calling the 2019 novel coronavirus the ‘Chinese’ or ‘Wuhan’ coronavirus is as descriptive as calling it the ‘CPAC coronavirus’ — that is to say not descriptive at all.”
MSNBC host Chris Hayes opined that it’s “just astoundingly gross to call it the Wuhan virus.”
The Chinese government agrees.
“Despite the fact that the WHO has officially named this novel type of coronavirus, certain American politicians, disrespecting science and the WHO decision, jumped at the first chance to stigmatize China and Wuhan with it,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. “We condemn this despicable practice.”
I think on the merits all of these people are mostly wrong. Many illnesses have been named after the place where they originated or were first identified. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague Lyman Stone points out, the Hong Kong flu, Asian flu, Russian flu, Berlin flu, Marburg virus and Zika virus (just to name a few) all derive their names from where they were first isolated. (Zika was named for a forest in Uganda.) Even Lyme disease derives its name from Old Lyme, Connecticut.
Moreover, as T. Becket Adams of the Washington Examiner has chronicled, many of the media outlets condemning the practice of referring to it as the “Chinese coronavirus” or the “Wuhan virus” used the same terminology until fairly recently, when the WHO coined the official name “COVID-19.” The New York Times posted a link to a Jan. 21 article, tweeting: “The first U.S. case of the Wuhan coronavirus has been confirmed in Washington State.” Even the Chinese government called it the “Wuhan virus” at first.
This also leaves out the fact that China deserves to be blamed for this turning into a pandemic. It initially tried to cover up the outbreak, refusing to cooperate with international health agencies and going so far as to arrest doctors who tried to notify the public of the dangers. Why people should be so eager to carry water for China’s PR cleanup operation is beyond me.
So on one level the woke warriors are just wrong. But there’s another dynamic at work as well.
While it’s not racist to refer to it as the Chinese coronavirus or Wuhan virus, there are people on the right eager to play into the very stereotype the left is decrying by refusing to use the official name. This brouhaha started in large part because of a “Wuhan virus” tweet by Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, a crackpot fond of playing footsie with white supremacist idiots. (He’s claimed, among other things, that the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was a left-wing stunt possibly funded by George Soros.)
Gosar is a special case, but plenty of more mainstream people enjoy using an unofficial label simply to troll the politically correct and elicit cries of “racism!”
Others have a more serious agenda. Some people, deeply committed to the new nationalist cause and the effort to paint China as an enemy of the United States, have jumped on this crisis as an opportunity to further stigmatize China. After all, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. That’s why President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday, “We need the Wall more than ever!”
In his address to the country Wednesday night, Trump said, “This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.” The response played out along the same lines as the virus-name controversy, with opponents decrying xenophobic bigotry and defenders noting that the statement is literally true.
The defenders are right, but the same problem applies. Why call it a “foreign” virus? Have we gone to greater lengths to defeat “domestic” viruses? Would we act differently if this wasn’t some invasive plague?
The need to troll China or piggyback an anti-China agenda (whatever its merits) as well as the need to decry the “real problem” of racism both strike me as desperate efforts to exploit a crisis or find comfort in more familiar arguments.
And it’s a spectacular waste of time and energy.

Texto completo: President Trump on Saturday broadened the European travel ban to include Britain and Ireland and said he was considering imposing restrictions on travel even within the United States to areas hardest hit by the fast-moving coronavirus.
As anxiety about the pandemic spread, Trump also revealed that he had been tested for the virus Friday night; the test came back negative, the White House said Saturday evening.
In Spain, the government ordered residents to stay home, with exceptions for work, grocery shopping, and medical visits. France shut down all “non-indispensable" businesses, including restaurants and movie theaters.
And in Massachusetts Saturday, the state announced 15 new cases of the coronavirus, increasing the total statewide to 138. Nineteen of those cases are confirmed, and 119 are presumptive, the state said. The vast majority can be traced back to a Biogen conference held at the Long Wharf Marriott late last month.
The new numbers came as Governor Charlie Baker established a command center aimed at expanding virus testing capacity and responding quickly to the needs of communities across the state.
But as Baker sought to project calm during a State House press conference, he also acknowledged that the state had tested just 475 residents to date — and indicated the federal government deserved much blame.
“We've said for the past several weeks that we are deeply concerned about the lack of a response from Washington to make it possible for states like ours to dramatically expand our testing criteria and our testing capacity," he said.
The governor noted Saturday that the state had made significant changes intended to speed up coronavirus testing. “Far more people are going to get tested over the next several weeks," Baker said.
Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher Scientific, the Waltham-based laboratory equipment firm, won federal approval to provide high-speed tests to hospitals and laboratories that will be able to diagnose the coronavirus in up to 5 million people a week.
The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the test, which can provide patient results within four hours of a sample being received by a lab, Thermo Fisher said late Friday.
Early Saturday evening, the State Police announced that the body of a 59-year-old Worcester man who had died on an Emirates flight from Dubai to Boston on Friday would be tested for the virus out of an abundance of caution. Officials said the man had been sick with gastrointestinal problems for several days prior to his death but did not have any preexisting medical conditions. The flight manifest appears to indicate 322 passengers and 18 crew members were aboard the plane, a Boeing 777, according to State Police.
The news came amid a growing list of shutdowns and restrictions on normal life across the region.
At a rare weekend meeting of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, officials temporarily closed the state's three casinos . Gaming floors will close just before 6 a.m. Sunday, with entire facilities to follow by midnight. They will be shut down for at least two weeks.
Northeastern University asked students to vacate their dorms no later than Tuesday evening. “This decision has been made in accordance with public health guidance to reduce density on campus, and due to the likelihood of further travel restrictions in the coming days," the school said in a notice to students.
Massachusetts trial courts announced a range of measures to reduce the number of people congregating in courthouses, relying increasingly on video and telephone conferences.
Local hospitals announced severe restrictions on visitors. Brigham and Women's Hospital will limit patients to one healthy adult visitor per day. Massachusetts General Hospital announced a similar policy Friday. Boston Children's Hospital will institute limits of two adult caregivers per day on Monday. Tufts Medical Center will prohibit all visitors for adult patients; pediatric patients will be allowed one immediate family member visit.
Rhode Island Governor Gina M. Raimondo said Saturday that the new restraints on public life have already led to job losses in that state, which has seen a rapid increase of people filing for unemployment.
“It's inevitable that people will be laid off," Raimondo said. “We are working with businesses to minimize this."
Retailers across the region seemed nearly desperate to get shoppers in the door. “COME IN," read a sign outside the clothing store Bonobos at the Prudential Center. “WE HAVE HAND SANITIZER."
Along with the relentless bad news, there were also new efforts to help those hit by the economic dislocation.
The United Way of Massachusetts Bay and the Merrimack Valley established a fund specifically dedicated to providing cash assistance to families hit hard by the crisis. One-time grants of up to $2,000 will be made to help families meet their basic food, child care, or housing needs.
“In Massachusetts, two in five workers lack sufficient savings to withstand a sudden loss in wages," said United Way chief executive Michael K. Durkin. “With public events, schools, and workplaces shuttering as the pandemic unfolds, hourly, low-wage workers will experience unprecedented financial hardship. The problem is acute for hospitality workers, retail workers, and other hourly workers, many living paycheck to paycheck, with no clear options for recouping lost wages."
The US House, too, approved legislation to provide direct relief to Americans suffering physically, financially, and emotionally from the pandemic — a proposal the president has endorsed. The Senate still must vote on the package.
The news — from Washington and from across New England — came as local families were scrambling to figure out what to do with their children during a wave of school shutdowns, in some cases announced with little notice. In many suburban districts, the schools will be closed for two weeks. In Boston, starting Tuesday, the schools will be closed for six weeks.
“I think we're all in complete and total shock. We don't even know what this looks like yet," said Lynn Higgins, the mother of a freshman and a fifth-grader in Boston public schools.
Boston school officials have said they would have more detailed information for families on Sunday.
Baker, at the State House on Saturday, sought to put the crisis into perspective, even amid all the worry.
“There is no shortage of food or dry goods at our stores," he said. “Some shelves in some stores have been bare . . . but guess what, they weren't bare the next morning."
He cautioned against hoarding. “Filling your basement with two years worth of canned soup just means your neighbors . . . will have to go without," the governor noted.
Meanwhile, as many residents hunkered down at home, some ventured out to the St. Patrick's Day weekend parties near TD Garden.
At the Harp on Saturday, more than 100 partiers dressed in Celtics jerseys and felt leprechaun hats sipped on green aluminum bottles of Bud Light. The bar was half-empty, but drinkers crowded close by the bar to be heard over the collective din.
“For the first few minutes, we were like, 'Let's keep our distance. Let's not touch people,' " said Marco Espinoza, a reveler from Raleigh, N.C., in a green motorcycle jacket, said. “But after a few beers we were hugging people and getting too close."
Tonya Alanez, Jonathan Saltzman, Stephanie Ebbert, Amanda Milkovitz, John Hilliard, and Kevin Paul Dupont of the Globe staff and Globe correspondents Max Jungreis and Lucas Phillips contributed to this report.

Virus terminology debates are a waste of time, energy

Texto completo: Amidst all of the well-placed urgency and occasionally misplaced panic of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have decided there's a pressing need to debate whether terms such as "Wuhan virus" or "Chinese coronavirus" are racist.
On one side is a broad coalition that includes liberal pundits, Democratic politicians, the World Health Organization and the Chinese government.
"Calling it the 'Chinese coronavirus' isn't just racist," Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted, "it's dangerous and incites discrimination against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants."
Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, says, "Calling the 2019 novel coronavirus the 'Chinese' or 'Wuhan' coronavirus is as descriptive as calling it the 'CPAC coronavirus' -- that is to say not descriptive at all."
MSNBC host Chris Hayes opined that it's "just astoundingly gross to call it the Wuhan virus."
The Chinese government agrees.
"Despite the fact that the WHO has officially named this novel type of coronavirus, certain American politicians, disrespecting science and the WHO decision, jumped at the first chance to stigmatize China and Wuhan with it," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. "We condemn this despicable practice."
I think on the merits all of these people are mostly wrong. Many illnesses have been named after the place where they originated or were first identified. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague Lyman Stone points out, the Hong Kong flu, Asian flu, Russian flu, Berlin flu, Marburg virus and Zika virus (just to name a few) all derive their names from where they were first isolated. (Zika was named for a forest in Uganda.) Even Lyme disease derives its name from Old Lyme, Conn.
Moreover, as T. Becket Adams of the Washington Examiner has chronicled, many of the media outlets condemning the practice of referring to it as the "Chinese coronavirus" or the "Wuhan virus" used the same terminology until fairly recently, when the WHO coined the official name "COVID-19." The New York Times posted a link to a Jan. 21 article, tweeting: "The first U.S. case of the Wuhan coronavirus has been confirmed in Washington State." Even the Chinese government called it the "Wuhan virus" at first.
This also leaves out the fact that China deserves to be blamed for this turning into a pandemic. It initially tried to cover up the outbreak, refusing to cooperate with international health agencies and going so far as to arrest doctors who tried to notify the public of the dangers. Why people should be so eager to carry water for China's PR cleanup operation is beyond me.
So on one level the woke warriors are just wrong. But there's another dynamic at work as well.
While it's not racist to refer to it as the Chinese coronavirus or Wuhan virus, there are people on the right eager to play into the very stereotype the left is decrying by refusing to use the official name. This brouhaha started in large part because of a "Wuhan virus" tweet by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a crackpot fond of playing footsie with white supremacist idiots. (He's claimed, among other things, that the 2017 "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Va., was a left-wing stunt possibly funded by George Soros.)
Gosar is a special case, but plenty of more mainstream people enjoy using an unofficial label simply to troll the politically correct and elicit cries of "racism!"
Others have a more serious agenda. Some people, deeply committed to the new nationalist cause and the effort to paint China as an enemy of the United States, have jumped on this crisis as an opportunity to further stigmatize China. After all, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. That's why President Trump tweeted on Tuesday, "We need the Wall more than ever!"
In his address to the country Wednesday night, Trump said, "This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history." The response played out along the same lines as the virus-name controversy, with opponents decrying xenophobic bigotry and defenders noting that the statement is literally true.
The defenders are right, but the same problem applies. Why call it a "foreign virus"? Have we gone to greater lengths to defeat "domestic" viruses? Would we act differently if this wasn't some invasive plague?
The need to troll China or piggyback an anti-China agenda (whatever its merits) as well as the need to decry the "real problem" of racism both strike me as desperate efforts to exploit a crisis or find comfort in more familiar arguments.
And it's a spectacular waste of time and energy.

A call for the governor to investigate the JEA matter

Texto completo: A call for the governor to investigate the JEA matter

I am happy to note that, so far, Gov. Ron DeSantis has done a highly creditable job.

I am sure he is abundantly aware of the situation regarding the proposed sale of JEA. In fact, the local state attorney was, at one time "looking into" the matter but turned it over to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

However, the federal government appears to be moving at what can charitably be called an extremely glacial pace.

We, the ratepayers and fellow Floridians, have been the victims of a monstrous scam that has cost the utility (meaning us, the ratepayers) millions of dollars.

We deserve to know who is really responsible for this mess.

One nagging question is why our mayor decided to install, as chief executive of the utility, a person who had no experience in working in an electric utility, much less in managing one, when at least two persons with wide experience in utility management had applied for, and were interested in, taking on the job.

This manager's only interest was in selling it, and in larding the sale with cushy jobs for himself and others. Many of us believe that the Mayor's Office is deeply involved in the plot to sell the utility, which, since he is a fellow Republican, might make it difficult for DeSantis.

However, since he has shown that he is the governor for all Floridians, I am confident that he will look into it.

We cannot depend on, or wait for, the federal government to do it

Reader questions risk of coronavirus from a letter

A recent letter writer talked of the possibility of a mortality rate of 1 percent of 300 million people from the coronavirus.

The 1 percent mortality rate should be applied to the mortality of those infected, not the population of our country. This is exactly how panic is spread.

John Reinheimer, Fleming Island

Note to Readers: Epidemic experts told The New York Times that, under a worst-case scenario, 160 million to 214 million Americans could be infected and 200,000 to 1.7 million could die. Prevention such as aggressive quarantines and social distancing would reduce the toll.

Texto completo: China is starting to get back to work. More than six weeks after its leaders virtually shut down the world's second-largest economy to stop a relentless coronavirus outbreak, factories are reopening and offices are starting to fill.
That's little solace to Zhang Xu. Piles of windshields -- some broken, others new and ready to be installed -- sit untouched at his car repair shop in a blue-collar neighborhood in Shanghai. One of his two employees is still stuck in a faraway village. But that matters little, because Zhang has no customers.
"If we don't get sales, the distributor won't be able to order more from the factory, and the factory won't be able to produce," Zhang said.
Stopping the Chinese industrial machine was painful for China and for the world -- and restarting it may be even harder. Factories are well short of full capacity. Even the most successfully restarted cities are only halfway back. Tens of millions of laborers cannot get to work. Even when workers come back, Chinese businesses may find overseas demand slumping for their exports because of worsening coronavirus epidemics in other countries.
China's difficulties could hold lessons for other countries looking for answers to the outbreak. Looking for a way to slow the virus without sinking the economy, the United States on Wednesday blocked travelers from Europe, and President Donald Trump has said he wants to get consumers spending more. The Italian government imposed travel restrictions Monday on the entire country. Other places, like South Korea, have intensified testing and monitoring without trying to shut down their industrial engines.
Unquestionably, China has made progress starting up again. As supply chains in the West began to run dry, airfreight rates from China jumped suddenly last week, according to TAC Index, an air cargo pricing data company in Hong Kong.
Beijing has unleashed a series of measures to get offices and factories humming again. Bankers describe almost daily phone calls from regulators, telling them to show leniency on debt repayments, particularly from smaller businesses.
More than 50 million migrant workers have not yet returned to their jobs, according to official data. Some remain in quarantine. Others are stranded in rural areas where bus service has not resumed. Many are not yet needed by employers.
Factory owners face still one more problem: slowing global demand for the goods China makes. The coronavirus outbreak is threatening global growth, which could slow factories just as they restart.
"If the demand shock is not addressed fast, then it could become a problem," said Cao Heping, a Peking University economist.

Fox's Hannity, others compare coronavirus deaths to Chicago's shooting homicides

Texto completo: First came the comparisons to the flu: About four times more Americans die each year from the flu than the total coronavirus death toll worldwide so far.
President Donald Trump was among those making the flu comparison. Then after a weekend in which, by one count, 26 Chicagoans were shot, some on social media began comparing the number of people shot and killed in Chicago to the number of Americans who have died from COVID-19.
Among them was Fox News host Sean Hannity, who did not respond to a request for comment. On his program Tuesday night, Hannity suggested the "liberal left" stop placing blame about coronavirus on President Trump, particularly since "Dem-controlled" Chicago can't even guarantee the safety of its residents.
But a medical expert who has studied both viruses and violent crime says such comparisons aren't valid.
With the flu comparison, Americans have more immunity to the flu because it has been around for hundreds of years and because we know how to make vaccines for the new strains of it that crop up each year.
And Linda Teplin, a professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine who has studied the risk of contracting AIDS and the risk of being a victim of violent crime, said given how little is known about COVID-19, and how bad it might get, an accurate picture of the risk associated with coronavirus is virtually impossible to paint.
"It's apples and oranges, that's why I think it's not an apt comparison," she said.
"I think he's saying, why are we worrying so much about the coronavirus. ... The problem with that logic is that we don't know how terrible the coronavirus might be and uncertainty breeds fear," she said.
Uncertainty can also cause people to disproportionately focus on the risk of things they perceive to be out of their control, while habit encourages denial about the risks associated with daily activities.
"We fear the risk of uncommon events while we underplay the risk of everyday life. Pedestrian deaths are up because people are paying too much attention to their phones, but people aren't afraid of walking," she said.
"With firearm violence, we think we can avoid it because we live in good neighborhoods," Teplin said. "The nation pays far more attention to coronavirus than to the number of people killed from gun violence."
Teplin said to get an idea of the mortality rate for coronavirus, reliable information about the number of cases is necessary, and she thinks it is unlikely that's happening in the United States.
"We don't know the true prevalence. Cases aren't reported unless they come to the attention of clinics and hospitals -- the most severe cases," she said.
Andrew Lawrence, director of Media Matters for America, a liberal organization dedicated to rebutting conservative media outlets, flagged Hannity's comparison on Twitter. Lawrence said Hannity's comparison was "whataboutism," which seeks to deflect focus from one issue by asking "what about" an unrelated issue.
"Hannity trying to use (Chicago's violence) to downplay coronavirus felt really gross. The Trump-supporting media is really trying to make this political and with something like this where it's a pandemic, you can't 'what-about' that away," he said.
With roughly 4 million viewers -- the biggest audience in cable news -- the majority of whom are older Americans most at risk for becoming seriously ill or dying from coronavirus, Lawrence said Hannity's attempt to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19 is dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has specifically identified older people as being at higher risk from serious complications if they contract the virus.
Nielsen, the TV ratings agency, lists the average age of a Fox News viewer as 65 years old, the New York Times reported.

For pregnant women in jail, measure of dignity too late Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: You may not recognize the name Tammy Jackson. But you know her story.
Left alone and abandoned in a Broward jail cell, Jackson gave birth to a daughter last April after seven hours of labor as her anguished cries for help went ignored. The 35-year-old Jackson, who is mentally ill, was in a Pompano Beach jail on a cocaine possession charge and held in isolation because she was pregnant, the sheriff's office said. This inexcusable neglect was first brought to light last May when the Broward public defender, Howard Finkelstein, describing himself as "incensed and heartbroken," raised pointed questions in a letter to Sheriff Gregory Tony.
The mistreatment of Tammy Jackson forced the Legislature to take action after the case drew outrage across the country and brought demands for a full investigation. Lawmakers were shocked to discover that nothing in state law prevented a pregnant woman from being isolated in jail or held in confinement.
Is it really necessary to legislate humanity and decency? Sadly, the answer is yes.
A bill headed to Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk will ensure that pregnant women are afforded basic protections of respect, dignity and humanity behind bars. The bill (SB 1259) is the work of Rep. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, Rep. Amy Mercado, D-Orlando, and Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Miami. They received encouragement from many community groups including the Dignity Coalition, a statewide grassroots effort of women who have served time in jail.
The simple fact that these long-overdue changes passed both chambers by unanimous votes reflects the level of outrage by policymakers in both political parties and the need for reform.
After DeSantis signs the bill into law, it will be illegal to place a pregnant inmate in restrictive housing unless extraordinary circumstances justify it.
She must be visited at least once every 24 hours, kept in the least restrictive setting and given an intensive medical treatment plan - none of which took place in Tammy Jackson's case.
The bill includes new restrictions on body cavity searches of pregnant prisoners and prevents officers from using restraints on pregnant inmates if a medical professional requests it, and new rules will require correctional officers to document any extraordinary circumstances. If a prisoner misses her due date, she must be placed in an infirmary and be provided the same privileges as other inmates.
The only exception provided for in the bill authorizes a pregnant prisoner to be involuntarily placed in restrictive housing if the corrections official, in consultation with the individual overseeing prenatal care and medical treatment at the correctional institution, determines that an extraordinary circumstance exists such that restrictive housing is necessary and that there are no less restrictive means available.
According to a legislative analysis, four to 10 percent of women are pregnant when they go to jail or prison. Their health is often compromised by a lack of prenatal care, poor diet or untreated medical and psychiatric conditions. African-American women like Tammy Jackson are three to four times more likely to suffer pregnancy complications than white women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Sheriff Tony, who was appointed by DeSantis last year, has said that his office and the jail health care provider, Wellpath, have expanded training to all staff members focusing on pregnant inmates, and that two employees were fired and three others received counseling and corrective action plans.
According to The New York Times, based on an account provided by Jackson's lawyers, the inmate was found by jail guards at 10 a.m. last April 10, clutching her newborn daughter.
No pregnant woman should give birth alone, especially when she is in custody. And no pregnant woman should ever be placed in solitary confinement, anywhere. It is unsafe. More importantly, it is inhumane. Florida has among the highest incarceration rates in the country for women and men.
The legislation will take effect on July 1. It is called the "Tammy Jackson Healthy Pregnancies for Incarcerated Women Act."
Ms. Jackson never wanted any notoriety and her anguished cries for help were callously ignored for too long. Far too late, her cause got the attention she deserved the night she lay alone and in excruciating pain on the cold, hard floor of a Broward jail.

Texto completo: SHANGHAI - China is starting to get back to work. More than six weeks after its leaders virtually shut down the world's second-largest economy to stop a relentless coronavirus outbreak, factories are reopening and offices are starting to fill.
That's little solace to Zhang Xu. Piles of windshields - some broken, others new and ready to be installed - sit untouched at his car repair shop in a blue-collar neighborhood in Shanghai. One of his two employees is still stuck in a faraway village. But that matters little, because Zhang has no customers.
"If we don't get sales, the distributor won't be able to order more from the factory and the factory won't be able to produce," Zhang said.
Stopping the Chinese industrial machine was painful for China and for the world - and restarting it may be even harder. Factories are well short of full capacity. Even the most successfully restarted cities are only halfway back. Tens of millions of laborers cannot get to work. Even when workers come back, Chinese businesses may find overseas demand slumping for their exports because of worsening coronavirus epidemics in other countries.
China's difficulties could hold lessons for other countries looking for answers to the outbreak. Looking for a way to slow the virus without sinking the economy, the United States on Wednesday blocked travelers from Europe, and President Donald Trump has said he wants to get consumers spending more. The Italian government imposed travel restrictions Monday on the entire country. Other places, like South Korea, have intensified testing and monitoring without trying to shut down their industrial engines.
Unquestionably, China has made progress starting up again. As supply chains in the West began to run dry, airfreight rates from China jumped suddenly last week, according to TAC Index, an air cargo pricing data company in Hong Kong.
"They need to be refilled now," said John Peyton Burnett, the company's managing director.
But factories in China are running at 50% to 60% of capacity, he said, and other measures show even less activity in many places.
Beijing has unleashed a series of measures to get offices and factories humming again. Bankers describe almost daily phone calls from regulators, telling them to show leniency on debt repayments, particularly from smaller businesses. Insurers have been told to extend policies even when premiums are not paid on time.
The state-owned railway has halved a wide range of freight charges. The national Education Ministry has created 180,000 spaces at graduate schools next autumn for students graduating this spring with little prospect of a job. Shanghai alone says it has helped residents and businesses with more than $15 billion in loans and other credit assistance, mainly from the state-controlled banking sector.
Those measures face formidable hurdles. Local officials are under pressure to reduce new infections, making them nervous about allowing people to return to work.
Cash-strapped families may also be reluctant to spend. Household and corporate debts are huge after a decade of heavy lending by the state-controlled banking sector. Workers do not know whether their employers can pay them. Businesses do not know if other businesses will default on payments for goods and services.
More than 50 million migrant workers have not yet returned to their jobs, according to official data. Some remain in quarantine. Others are stranded in rural areas where bus service has not resumed. Many are not yet needed by employers.
Factory owners face still one more problem: slowing global demand for the goods China makes. The coronavirus outbreak is threatening global growth, which could slow factories just as they restart. "If the demand shock is not addressed fast, then it could become a problem," said Cao Heping, a Peking University economist.

Texto completo: About two months ago, Yo Gotti saw photos and videos shared online of Mississippi prisons in the midst of riots that lasted nearly a week and resulted in dozens of injuries and several deaths.
The Memphis-born hip-hop artist decided he needed to do something to help.
Yo Gotti and Jay-Z's organization, Team Roc, has launched a public pressure campaign and litigation.
In January Team Roc helped organize a rally at the Capitol in Jackson that was attended by hundreds of protesters. Yo Gotti and Jay-Z have penned letters to Gov. Tate Reeves and former Gov. Phil Bryant. They also helped inmates at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman file two lawsuits against corrections officials, alleging prison conditions are unconstitutional.
"I was just standing up for something I felt passionate about, something I believe in," Yo Gotti told the Clarion Ledger on March 6.
'I grew up in a family that was incarcerated' The Memphis native said incarceration is a personal issue for him.
"My brother was in prison, my aunties served time in prison, my father served time in prison over and over again so I grew up as a kid going inside different state penitentiaries and federal prisons visiting my family," Yo Gotti said. "So I understand people with family members inside prisons and understand people who've been inside prisons and came home."
The photos and videos circulating on social media — which showed blood soaked striped prisoners' outfits, insects crawling over trays of food and violent beatings in prison cells — hit home for the rapper.
"It could be easily one of our family members," Yo Gotti said.
Yo Gotti said many things he's learned about Mississippi prison system have troubled him.
Some inmates with diabetes and cancer don't receive proper medication, he said. Water pooling in the prison is contaminated with feces. Cockroaches crawl in the food. Prisoners live in cells without electricity.
The latest lawsuit Team Roc helped file represents more than 150 Parchman inmates. The lawsuit alleges guards hand keys over to inmates so they can assault — or kill — other convicts and that inmates can't sleep at night, fearing that packs of rats could crawl into their bunks. It claims that care is so bad inmates set things on fire to get staff members to pay attention to medical emergencies.
When Reeves announced he is closing down Parchman's Unit 29 — a housing unit plagued by violence and deteriorating conditions — it was welcome news for Yo Gotti.
"We thought it was a great start but it ain't enough," he said. "(There are) issues and problems throughout the whole facility."
Shutting down Unit 29 "is not the answer," he said. "People still dying."
With the prisoner death toll now at 24 since Dec. 29, Yo Gotti called on Reeves to "declare a state of emergency."
He said he also wants to see companies that contract with the Mississippi Department of Corrections to provide food and medical services — Aramark and Centurion — to be held accountable for poor nutrition and care that inmates receive.
Yo Gotti urged inmates and families of inmates to continue to work together.
"Keep pushing with us and together we'll keep pushing til we hope we get a resolution," he said.
As for everyone else, Yo Gotti said, education is important.
"People (need to) educate themselves on what's happening inside their prison and look at the videos and photos coming from the prison. Anything you can do to help spread the word, step up, I think it would all be appreciated," he said.
Recent letter to Miss. governor Last week, Team Roc took out full page ads in the Clarion Ledger and New York Times to publish another open letter to Reeves.
It was the second letter Yo Gotti has addressed to Reeves, who took office in January.
The first one, published in late January, struck a flattering tone: "You ... gave thousands of inmates and family members even a glimmer of hope that they had a governor unafraid to look at problems with fresh eyes," he wrote.
The next one, not as much.
"We need to be blunt," the letter signed by Yo Gotti and Jay-Z and published Feb. 27 began. "... We've heard you talk about bold and immediate action; now we need to see results before more lives are destroyed. The situation is critical."
Prisoners, many of whom are serving time for non-violent crimes, are being assaulted, raped murdered and driven to suicide, the letter said.
"It's incomprehensible that this is happening in the modern-day United States; that we allow our fellow citizens to suffer so acutely in the name of justice. And what are we teaching these men who, if they survive your prison system, will eventually be released and expected to be a member of society?"
The letter said that the prison system is now part of Reeves' "legacy."
"You can no longer point to prior administrations as the culprits and no longer attempt to scapegoat the inmates, many of whom had the simple misfortune of being arrested in Mississippi.
"... Every day you refuse to do the moral and just thing malnourished inmates will be forced to lie on the cold wet ground, shivering in their own filth, and wondering if they will live to see another day. Or if they even want to," the letter said.

Halting China's economy was hard. Restarting it is harder.

Texto completo: SHANGHAI - China is starting to get back to work. More than six weeks after its leaders virtually shut down the world's second-largest economy to stop a relentless coronavirus outbreak, factories are reopening and offices are starting to fill.
That's little solace to Zhang Xu. Piles of windshields - some broken, others new and ready to be installed - sit untouched at his car repair shop in a blue-collar neighborhood in Shanghai. One of his two employees is still stuck in a faraway village. But that matters little, because Zhang has no customers.
"If we don't get sales, the distributor won't be able to order more from the factory and the factory won't be able to produce," Zhang said.
Stopping the Chinese industrial machine was painful for China and for the world - and restarting it may be even harder. Factories are well short of full capacity. Even the most successfully restarted cities are only halfway back. Tens of millions of laborers cannot get to work. Even when workers come back, Chinese businesses may find overseas demand slumping for their exports because of worsening coronavirus epidemics in other countries.
China's difficulties could hold lessons for other countries looking for answers to the outbreak. Looking for a way to slow the virus without sinking the economy, the United States on Wednesday blocked travelers from Europe, and President Donald Trump has said he wants to get consumers spending more. The Italian government imposed travel restrictions Monday on the entire country. Other places, like South Korea, have intensified testing and monitoring without trying to shut down their industrial engines.
Unquestionably, China has made progress starting up again. As supply chains in the West began to run dry, airfreight rates from China jumped suddenly last week, according to TAC Index, an air cargo pricing data company in Hong Kong.
"They need to be refilled now," said John Peyton Burnett, the company's managing director.
But factories in China are running at 50% to 60% of capacity, he said, and other measures show even less activity in many places.
Beijing has unleashed a series of measures to get offices and factories humming again. Bankers describe almost daily phone calls from regulators, telling them to show leniency on debt repayments, particularly from smaller businesses. Insurers have been told to extend policies even when premiums are not paid on time.
The state-owned railway has halved a wide range of freight charges. The national Education Ministry has created 180,000 spaces at graduate schools next autumn for students graduating this spring with little prospect of a job. Shanghai alone says it has helped residents and businesses with more than $15 billion in loans and other credit assistance, mainly from the state-controlled banking sector.
Those measures face formidable hurdles. Local officials are under pressure to reduce new infections, making them nervous about allowing people to return to work.
Cash-strapped families may also be reluctant to spend. Household and corporate debts are huge after a decade of heavy lending by the state-controlled banking sector. Workers do not know whether their employers can pay them. Businesses do not know if other businesses will default on payments for goods and services.
More than 50 million migrant workers have not yet returned to their jobs, according to official data. Some remain in quarantine. Others are stranded in rural areas where bus service has not resumed. Many are not yet needed by employers.
Factory owners face still one more problem: slowing global demand for the goods China makes. The coronavirus outbreak is threatening global growth, which could slow factories just as they restart. "If the demand shock is not addressed fast, then it could become a problem," said Cao Heping, a Peking University economist.

Florida needs to plan for the switch from gasoline

Texto completo: When you think of electric cars, chances are one name comes to mind: Tesla.
But not for long.
Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, Toyota, in fact all the major car makers, have recently announced a blizzard of electric car offerings that will be in showrooms starting late this year, and continuing into the next decade.
Last week, General Motors went all in, with CEO Mary Barra pledging 20 new electric models by 2023, starting off with an improved Chevrolet Bolt later this year, and including an all-electric Hummer truck and a Cadillac SUV in 2022. Barra says the carmaker plans to be selling more than 1 million electric vehicles a year around the world by 2025.
"We want to get as many EVs on the road as possible," Barra told a gathering of GM executives this month, according to The New York Times. "We believe climate change is real, and we have the ability and responsibility to create a cleaner, healthier planet."
Replacing gas and diesel cars and trucks with electric vehicles, called EVs in the trade, is a key to reducing fossil fuel emissions that are heating the earth's climate. Gasoline and other fossil fuels burned to power our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes are the largest source of CO2 pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
In the U.S., Florida has the fourth highest number of EVs on the road at about 38,000 cars, according to Drive Electric Florida, a private group of industry professionals formed to promote EVs.
That's a high number, given that state leaders have been "very skittish" to offer incentives, either to buyers of EVs or in constructing electric charging stations, as other state have done, said Matthew Alford, executive director Drive Electric Florida.
Alford is encouraged by the expected passage this week of legislation that requires the development by July 2021 of a Florida master plan to develop EV charging stations along state roads.
Most importantly, according to Alford, legislators are reaching out to stakeholders — car makers, electric utilities, academics and others — to make recommendations for the study, and for future legislation.
"That's an indication of how seriously lawmakers are taking this," Alford said. "I think they are truly making an honest effort to get a handle on the best ways to move forward."
Deciding how Florida should invest to promote electric vehicle use is complicated when considering a fast-developing technology that can make seemingly good ideas quickly obsolete.
For example, in 20 years plugging your car into a charging station and waiting 30 minutes will seem antiquated, Alford said. With technology being developed now, it's possible that your electric car will be recharged as you drive using wireless sensors built into the highway.
And then there is the impact on the state's electric utilities to consider, with some saying that a mass switchover to EVs will create a surge in electricity consumption, similar to the mass adoption of air conditioning in the last century.
And like air conditioning, electric cars will become a fixture of life, and sooner rather than later.
Three big trends are making this possible: the electric batteries inside the cars are rapidly improving, extending driving ranges between charges to 300 miles and up; the cost of electric cars is falling – indeed, G.M. officials say many of their EV models will be priced competitively with current models fueled by gasoline.
And finally, there is the prospect of autonomous vehicles, which will be powered by electricity. Technology titans Google, Amazon, Apple and others are spending lavishly on research to dominate here, along with car makers and microprocessor manufacturers.

"The Invading Sea" is the opinion arm of the Florida Climate Reporting Network, a collaborative of news organizations across the state focusing on the threats posed by the warming climate.

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. 'My Dark Vanessa' by Kate Elizabeth Russell (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: When she was 15, Vanessa had a sexual relationship with her 42-year-old English teacher. At the time, she was thrilled by what she thought was a consensual romance. Years later, that same teacher is accused of sexual abuse by a former student. Does Vanessa remain silent and hold on to that illusion, or does she face the ugly truth of her first love?
The buzz: "Russell offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement..." says a review in Publishers Weekly.
2. 'The Mirror & the Light' by Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt & Co., fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The final book in Mantel's historical trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell in the court of King Henry VIII.
The buzz: The publisher has kept a tight lid on this one, but the early reviews are rapturous. "With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of," says a review in The Guardian.
3. 'MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman' by Ben Hubbard (Tim Duggan Books, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The Beirut bureau chief for the New York Times paints a gripping portrait of the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, the mysterious and powerful young Saudi Arabian prince who ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The buzz: "A chilling look at the ascent of the current young prince of Saudi Arabia to first-in-line to succession," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
4. 'A Good Neighborhood' by Therese Anne Fowler's (St. Martin's Press, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: Two families are at odds in the tight-knit North Carolina community of Oak Knoll. Valerie Alston-Hold, a black professor with a musically gifted, biracial son, objects when her neighbors, the nouveau riche white family, the Whitmans, raze the lot next door to build a showplace. Then their teenagers fall in love.
The buzz: "A riveting, potentially redemptive story of modern American suburbia that reads almost like an ancient Greek tragedy," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
5. 'Recollections of My Nonexistence' by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: A portrait of the artist as a young woman. In her new memoir, Solnit reflects on her growth as a writer, feminist and activist in 1980s San Francisco, and on finding her voice in a society that prefers women to pipe down.
The buzz: A starred review in Kirkus Reviews calls it "a perceptive, radiant portrait of a writer of indelible consequence."

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: KEY WEST, Fla. – J. Seward Johnson II, the world-famous sculptor and grandson of the founder of Johnson & Johnson, has died at age 89.
Johnson's sculptures have been displayed throughout the world and Central Jersey, including at Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton, which he founded and filled with dozens of sculptures, his own original pieces of art included.
Most recently, his life-sized bronze statutes of living people, which the artist might be best known for, made appearances in downtown Somerville in spring 2019.
Johnson was born in New Brunswick in 1930, the son of John Seward Johnson I. His grandfather was Robert Wood Johnson I, who went on to co-found Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, which became a global powerhouse in the pharmaceutical industry.
Johnson died March 10 in Key West, where he owned a home located next to the buoy that marks the most southern point in the continental U.S., making his Florida home the southernmost residence in the country.
According to The New York Times, Johnson died at this home from cancer.
Before his Somerville installation, Johnson had displayed his artwork in other small towns throughout the state.
When displaying sculptures in Toms River in 2015, Johnson said his "art is an imitation of life."
Johnson, who first tried his hand at painting before moving to sculpture, said his sculptures "can warm up" a park or public space and "invite people to come into that space, so that they don't feel quite alone."
"They also make good neighbors — they don't make a lot of noise," he added.
In 2016, he displayed his work at Monmouth University. By that time, he had more than 450 of life-size cast bronze figures featured in private collections and museums in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia, according to the university. He also had exhibits in several prominent public spaces including Rockefeller Center, Pacific Place, Hong Kong, Les Halles in Paris, and Via Condotti in Rome.
His largest sculpture — the 70-foot aluminum colossus entitled "The Awakening" — is featured at the National Harbor on the banks of the Potomac River outside of Washington D.C.
He had no formal training in sculpture other than a few classes he took in Cambridge, Massachusetts, according to his memorial on the Grounds for Sculpture's website. He graduated from the college preparatory Forman School in Litchfield, Connecticut, which is a school for students with learning disabilities, before attending the University of Maine.
He enlisted in the Navy and spent four years aboard the USS Gloucester, according to the memorial. Johnson later settled in New Jersey to raise three children, and spent his time between in New York City, Nantucket and Key West.
He grew up on a property on River Road in Highland Park that now houses the retirement community Parker at Stonegate.
The property was nestled near the Merriewold Estate Castle, which was built by his father for his mother, Ruth Dill Johnson. The castle is now part of the retirement community.
In 2008, Johnson visited the property for the first time since his childhood, according to a story in the Home News Tribune. He then contributed several sculptures of his for the grounds of the retirement community.
While touring the retirement community with Parker's President and CEO Roberto Muñiz, Johnson remarked, "I feel very much at home here. My sculptures feel at home."

Getting a clearer view of Steuben Glass

Texto completo: Of all the categories covered in these columns over the past months, art glass is among the most varied. Across the years, hundreds of makers have come and gone, utilizing their skills and imagination to leave imprints of various size. Among all of those, Steuben surely stands out as one of the greats. While many storied glassmakers have faltered or failed to remain relevant in their offerings — Waterford is an example — Steuben continues to command premium prices and a strong following among collectors. Here's some background:
The coming of the 20th century served as a now-or-never impetus for many entrepreneurs, including the two founders of Steuben. The company began as a partnership between noted glass engraver T.G. Hawkes and art glass manufacturer Frederick Carder. The idea of applying art to glass rather than just design and color wasn't new, but the idea that it could be produced both in quality and quantity was quite novel.
By 1918, WWI was drawing to a close and American businesses were once again focusing on consumer wants and needs. Recognizing this, the firm of Corning Glass Works of Corning, New Corning acquired Steuben, thus enabling the firm to realize its potential as a luxury brand of the first order. Today, Corning is a multi-national technology company, best known to consumers for its Corningware and Pyrex brands. Interestingly, it was also the developer of Gorilla Glass, that extra-hard stuff that enabled Apple to introduce its nearly bulletproof iPhones not so many years ago. But back to Steuben.
In 1932, Steuben developed its own signature glass, a highly refractive type that emitted a dazzling array of colors when illuminated with a beam of light. It was also much stronger than its delicate appearance suggested, enabling it to be manipulated and engraved with extra vigor. Although reconfigured a few years ago to be lead-free, this type of glass remains a touchstone of all Steuben products.
So enamored with this new glass were Steuben executives that they purged all colored glass from the Steuben line-up the following year. The emphasis was now on sculptured glass and designs with an architectural flair.
This new approach turned out to be just the thing. Despite the Depression, Steuben opened its first store in New York City in 1934. For those with the resources to indulge, it was a fantasy land of crystal imagination, hailed by The New York Times as unprecedented in its beauty and serenity.
From there, new collections, new stores and many awards followed. The mid-century period witnessed a move away from functional pieces to more pure art glass forms. This opened the door to artistic expression and hundreds of new designs were added to the Steuben line. Also beginning at that time was a trend towards Steuben items serving as gifts between diplomats and Heads of State, a development that Steuben artfully promoted and used to its advantage. Among the many grateful recipients of such gifts over the years were Queen Elizabeth II, Premier Chou En-Lai of China, Prime Minister Lester Pearson of Canada, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Glittering crystal trophies with the Steuben imprint became another highly visible aspect of Steuben's business. Gorgeous creations were made for the America's Cup yacht race, the IndyCar series, and Major League Baseball, among many others.
In recent years, some changes have overtaken the firm, including its sale and subsequent repurchase by Corning and the closing of its Corning, NY factory in favor of licensed production. The Steuben of today focuses on special commissions, decor, stem and barware, and gift items. It has also reintroduced some of its most iconic designs, sold mostly online at three- and four-figure prices.
Original Steuben pieces from 1903-1932 are most easily identified by an acid-engraved fleur-de-lis with a STEUBEN imprint in block letters. Variations of this imprint have been used ever since. Whatever the mark, authentic Steuben pieces are always highly sought and will likely remain so for years to come.

Texto completo: Federal authorities are seeking to build a criminal case against a former Boeing Co. pilot based on statements from U.S. air-safety regulators who say he failed to provide them crucial details about the 737 MAX jet's flight-control system, according to people familiar with the matter.
A pair of Federal Aviation Administration officials who dealt with Boeing pilot Mark Forkner on pilot-training requirements for the FAA's approval process years before dual crashes of the MAX are now considered key witnesses in the investigation, these people said.
The central role of FAA officials Stacey Klein and William Schubbe in the criminal probe hasn't been reported before. It suggests Justice Department prosecutors and federal investigators are seeking to center a fraud case on claims that Mr. Forkner misled regulators about how a flight-control feature known as MCAS worked. Ms. Klein oversaw MAX pilot manuals and training, while Mr. Schubbe is a manager in the FAA office that helps determine pilot-training requirements for new aircraft.
The automated MCAS system has been blamed for putting two Boeing 737s into fatal nosedives within five months, taking 346 lives, prompting a grounding of the fleet and creating the most serious corporate crisis in Boeing's history.
A case against Mr. Forkner -- who left Boeing for a job with Southwest Airlines Co. after the MAX was certified by the FAA -- could lead to liability for the Chicago aerospace giant as well. Prosecutors typically have grounds to charge a company for criminal conduct once they have formally accused an employee of misconduct.
Mr. Forkner hasn't cooperated with the investigation, according to people familiar with his situation.
Mr. Forkner's attorneys, David Gerger and Matt Hennessy, said the FAA was aware of how MCAS worked.
"As far as Mark goes, he did his job honestly, and his communications to the FAA were honest," Mr. Forkner's lawyers said. "As a pilot and Air Force vet, he would never jeopardize the safety of other pilots or their passengers. That is what any fair investigation would find."
Boeing has cooperated with the federal investigations. It has said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Forkner's 2016 messages and would share its findings with authorities. Boeing has faulted flawed engineering assumptions about how pilots would respond to MCAS cockpit emergencies, and it is devising software and training fixes.
Boeing also must navigate an end to a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, one of the people said, which could allege its disclosures to investors didn't fully communicate important facts or risks related to the 737 MAX.
Ms. Klein couldn't be reached for comment. Through an FAA spokesman, Mr. Schubbe declined to comment. The spokesman said Ms. Klein, Mr. Schubbe and their colleagues are trained to do highly specialized jobs in a professional manner.
Internal Boeing emails from Mr. Forkner, released over the past few months, described pressure he felt from Boeing superiors in 2016 and 2017 to persuade the FAA that pilots wouldn't need extra ground-simulator training on MCAS. Mr. Forkner sent other messages to Boeing employees indicating that, as part of those efforts, he misled or provided incomplete information to the agency as well as airlines and foreign regulators. Congressional investigators, along with other Boeing critics, have highlighted Mr. Forkner's casual remarks regarding safety in those messages.
Mr. Gerger, the lawyer for Mr. Forkner, has previously said the messages should be understood as the comments of employees blowing off steam "in the ups and downs of their jobs."
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Forkner, who at the time was Boeing's chief technical pilot for the 737 MAX, persuaded Ms. Klein's group to remove references to MCAS from aircraft manuals, arguing pilots didn't need to know about the system because it would rarely, if ever, activate, according to his emails.
Ms. Klein has been involved in devising new pilot training for the modified MCAS system, but recently went on leave for a personal reason unrelated to the criminal investigation and the MAX, a person familiar with her testimony said. Aaron Perkins, a former commercial pilot who joined the FAA in 2011 and was involved in the MAX approval process, has taken over her role vetting training related to MCAS software fixes.
Mr. Perkins has told prosecutors he feels Mr. Forkner misled him and his colleagues before the plane went into service, according to one person familiar with his statements. Through an agency spokesman, Mr. Perkins declined to comment.
In August 2016, Ms. Klein was among the FAA employees who participated in test flights of the MAX, which used the final, more powerful version of MCAS, according to people familiar with the matter. It couldn't be learned whether those flights involved tests of MCAS or exposed its potential hazards. An earlier version of the system worked only at high speeds and was less potent.
Mr. Forkner was thrust into the spotlight last year when it emerged that in a 2016 instant message he acknowledged misleading regulators. "So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)," Mr. Forkner told a fellow Boeing pilot, suggesting he hadn't known at the time he talked to the FAA that engineers had modified MCAS to make it more powerful.
Mr. Gerger has said Mr. Forkner was discussing the performance of a simulator built to mirror the handling of a 737 Max. Mr. Forkner believed the problem was with that simulator, Mr. Gerger has said, and not with the plane itself.
Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun has called Mr. Forkner's messages "totally appalling," while company representatives repeatedly have said his communications contradicted Boeing's core values and commitment to safety.
A spokeswoman for Southwest said Mr. Forkner isn't focused on MAX-related work and has complied with company and federal standards applicable to pilots.
Over the months, prosecutors have interviewed current and former Boeing engineers and pilots, airline pilot-union officials and various FAA employees, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Forkner's former boss, Zekeriya Demir, is among the other Boeing employees who have been called to testify before the grand jury hearing evidence, the people said.
Mr. Demir's testimony hasn't been reported. He couldn't be reached for comment. The New York Times previously reported that prosecutors were gathering grand jury testimony about whether Mr. Forkner misled FAA officials.
Boeing has long insisted the FAA was aware of the system's final configuration, which was described in a letter and a number of presentations to the agency, though its revised power was never flagged to senior managers.

BIDEN 2020: A SANE, NORMAL POTATO

Texto completo: If it isn't perfectly clear already, the 2020 presidential campaign will be down to two characters within days: President Donald Trump and Democrat survivor Joe Biden, aka the exact matchup Mr. Trump got himself impeached trying to prevent.
Mr. Trump much preferred a contest against Bernie Sanders so he could blare the socialism siren around the clock and spend the next 7½ months golfing, tweeting and victimizing himself, but that road will be closed here in the next few days.
Mr. Sanders is still scheduled to debate Mr. Biden on Sunday night, at least as of my deadline, but it will be in Washington instead of Phoenix, and it will play out in an empty studio rather than for the entertainment pleasure of a hooting CNN audience - as it should, virus or no. But just about everyone knows Bernie is a walking ghost in this campaign now, having been scorched so badly in Michigan's primary this week that one of his senior advisers blurted to Yahoo News, "the [expletive] plane has crashed into the mountain."
The metaphorical mountain was a broad coalition of Biden voters in a state Mr. Sanders needed desperately (and so will Mr. Trump) - a coalition of union workers, African Americans and suburban whites. The Sanders revolution among young voters and passionate Bernie Bros again failed to mobilize sufficiently, and whether they will for the all-but-inevitable Biden nomination remains an open question, but it appears at least negotiable.
If Mr. Biden can persuade Mr. Sanders that he's progressive enough to engender some Democratic loyalty - something Hillary Clinton could or would not do in 2016 - Mr. Biden will only deepen Mr. Trump's nightmares. As Kevin DeWine, a former chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, explained it to the New York Times on Wednesday: "If it's Biden, you'll have disaffected Republicans run to the polls to vote for Biden because they're just looking for normal and sane."
That's Ohio, a state Mr. Trump can't win without.
As I've noted previously in this space, the race has only one issue and, for the Democrats, one qualification. The issue is Mr. Trump and the qualification is electability. After losing primaries in four states Tuesday, Mr. Sanders still claimed to be winning the "generational" argument but admitted to "losing the electability argument."
That's another way of saying, "game over."
Still, Mr. Biden's work is only beginning.
You should be able to run a baked potato against Mr. Trump and win by double digits, but too many Democrats consider Mr. Biden a baked potato who's been hanging out in the back of the oven since about 1992. His problems with young people won't disappear overnight, and he will remain an indestructible gaffe machine. The perceptual distance between the real Joe and his Saturday Night Live caricature (uproariously delivered by Jason Sudeikis) isn't significant enough to put Mr. Biden into the White House one day ahead of schedule.
Mr. Biden's remarks this week, however, and his coronavirus presentation in particular, gave him a running start.
"Tonight I'm speaking to you from the National Constitution Center, not far from two of the most important documents in all of history were written," Mr. Biden said late Tuesday in Philadelphia. "The Declaration of Independence - 'we hold these truths to be self-evident' - those words became the American creed known around the world, (and) the U.S. Constitution - 'we the people' - these words literally changed the world.
"We've never fully lived up to the promise of either of those documents, but we've never, ever before walked away from them. They're a reminder of what's at stake in this election. Our very democracy is at stake in this election. And I said from the moment I announced [his campaign] not far from here, that I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this nation. With Donald Trump as president, our core values, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America, America, is truly at stake. I believe this nation can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but given eight, four more years, you've forever and fundamentally changed the very character of this nation. We can't let that happen. Winning means uniting America, not sowing more division and anger. It means having a president that not only knows how to fight but knows how to heal. It means replacing a president who demeans and demonizes people with a president who believes in empathy, compassion, respect for everyone.
"We are a decent, brave, resilient moment. We are better than this moment. We just need to remember who we are. This is the United States of America; there's not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together."
Two days later, he stood and spoke coherently and comprehensively about what a coordinated, multiagency federal response ought to look like on a matter of a historic medical urgency.
That looks like a very palatable potato right now.

Texto completo: Election officials in the four states holding presidential primaries next week say they have no plans to postpone voting amid widespread disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Instead, they are taking extraordinary steps to ensure that voters can cast ballots and polling places are clean.
They have been scrambling to recruit replacements for poll workers dropping out over fears of contracting the virus, providing cotton swabs for voters to use on touchscreen machines and extending absentee voting deadlines. Only one state, Louisiana, announced plans to postpone its primary, from April to June.
"Americans have participated in elections during challenging times in the past, and based on the best information we have from public health officials, we are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election," top election officials from Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio said in a joint statement Friday that also encouraged healthy poll workers to show up.
Meanwhile, U.S. troops in Afghanistan are not being tested for the novel coronavirus, U.S. military officials told the House Armed Services Committee.
There is "no availability of testing for COVID-19" for troops there, a U.S. Central Command representative told the committee in a statement made available by the committee on Friday.
Members of Congress are particularly concerned about the nearly 13,000 troops in Afghanistan because many of them are deployed near Iran. Iran has more than 11,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, third most in the world behind China's 80,000-plus cases and Italy's more than 15,000, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Many U.S. troops are stationed in Italy.
South Korea, another nation with a substantial U.S. military presence, has nearly 8,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 - the fourth most in the world.
Congressional aides said they have been told that Central Command is weighing whether to scale back or cancel military exercises in the region, but no decisions have been made.
In Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez placed himself in isolation after becoming one of the first American elected officials to confirm he has COVID-19.
Mr. Suarez, 42, was tested after having come in close contact earlier this week with a top adviser to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who disclosed his diagnosis Thursday. A delegation from the South American country had visited Florida and also met with President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club.
Mr. Bolsonaro said Friday that he had tested negative, though people in the early stages of infection often do. The White House has said Mr. Trump does not need to be tested
For most people, COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus.
Election officials routinely prepare for natural disasters and other disruptions, but the COVID-19 outbreak poses a unique challenge as some areas of the country urge members of the public to work from home and avoid crowds.
Election Day voting in the U.S. largely relies on an army of poll workers who staff schools, community centers and government buildings open for the public to cast ballots in person. Because many poll workers are older, they may be especially concerned about the virus. School closures and safety concerns at senior living communities have thrown some polling places into question.
Nearly 50 of the roughly 600 paid volunteers have withdrawn in Volusia County, Fla. In that state, a group of voting and civil rights groups wrote to the governor and secretary of state urging them to extend early voting opportunities and the vote-by-mail deadline, open additional vote centers, and take steps to notify voters of any changes to polling places or voting procedures.
Hundreds of poll workers and election judges in Illinois have canceled their assignments, leaving election officials, particularly in Chicago, scrambling.
In Georgia, where the average age for poll workers is 70 years old, about 300 poll workers have said they would no longer be available to work in the March 24 primary. Early voting for Georgia's upcoming primary continued Friday, as state election officials weighed their options, including whether to postpone.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration but said it would not affect the state's May primary runoff elections that will decide congressional races. Wisconsin also said it planned to proceed with its April 7 primary.
But Louisiana officials decided the risk was too great. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he planned to sign an executive order delaying the April 4 primary until June 20, describing the step as "necessary to protect the health and safety of the people of Louisiana."

Texto completo: The court took up disputes over funding for President Trump's border wall and a subpoena to Donald F. McGahn II, his former White House counsel.
WASHINGTON -- The entire federal appeals court in Washington said on Friday that it would take up two cases that raised the question of whether and when Congress may sue to resolve a dispute with the president, setting up a double-barreled test for establishing when the judicial branch can resolve disputes over separation of powers.
In a terse order, the full appeals court said it would rehear a case involving a House Judiciary Committee subpoena to Donald F. McGahn II, President Trump's former White House counsel, vacating a 2-1 panel ruling last month that Congress could not sue to enforce its subpoenas of executive branch officials.
The full court also said it would immediately take up a case that House Democrats brought against Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin challenging the administration's use of emergency powers and other extraordinary measures to spend more taxpayer funds on Mr. Trump's border wall with Mexico than Congress had been willing to appropriate.
In the border wall case, a United States District Court judge had sided with Mr. Trump and dismissed the case, saying the House had no standing to bring it. An appeals court panel heard arguments in the case weeks ago but has not yet issued a ruling. The order said that the panel had requested that the full court hear that case since it also raised an issue of standing.
The full Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear arguments in both cases on April 28.
The cases raise major issues about the scope of the power of Congress to enlist the courts' aid when lawmakers believe a president is illegally spending funds -- defying its constitutional power of the purse -- or instructing an aide to illegally ignore a subpoena, defying its constitutional power to conduct oversight of the government.
The McGahn subpoena case is particularly important because it could have far-reaching consequences for executive branch secrecy powers long after Mr. Trump leaves office. The now-vacated panel ruling dealt a severe blow to Congress's ability to conduct oversight when a president is willing to simply stonewall "all" subpoenas, as Mr. Trump has vowed to do.
Mr. McGahn was a key witness in the second volume of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, about Mr. Trump's efforts to obstruct the Russia inquiry. The House wanted to question Mr. McGahn about the same topic.
But on Mr. Trump's instructions, Mr. McGahn defied the House subpoena. The House sued him, seeking a judicial order that he show up to testify, and won in district court in November.
The Justice Department filed an appeal, and last month, two of the three appeals court judges on the panel ruled that the Constitution gave the House no standing to file any such lawsuit in what they characterized as a political dispute with the executive branch -- a ruling that, if it stood, would cripple the ability of Congress to investigate current and future presidents.
Normally, panels of three judges decide disputes that come before federal appeals courts. But litigants who lose at the panel level can choose to appeal to the entire body to have the case reheard. That can be important when the ideological balance between the three-judge panel and the full court is different.
The scope of Congress's power to conduct oversight and seek judicial redress in disputes with the president has no fixed partisan implications; both major parties trade control of both branches, so sometimes a Republican Congress will be battling a Democratic president.
But so far, both cases have followed a pattern at both the district and appellate levels. Every judge who sided with Mr. Trump was a Republican appointee, and every judge who sided with Congress was a Democratic appointee. (In similar cases in the past, however, district court judges have sided against presidents of the same party of the president who appointed them.)
Notably, the partisan balance on the full appeals court cuts the other way: Seven of the 11 active judges were appointed by Democratic presidents.
Still, should the full appeals court determine that the House does have standing to bring the lawsuit and order Mr. McGahn to testify, the Justice Department could again appeal to the Supreme Court. There, five of the nine justices are conservative Republican appointees.
Depending on how long the case takes to resolve, the presidential election may take place in the interim. In 2008 and 2009, a similar dispute over whether a former White House lawyer for President George W. Bush, Harriet Miers, had to testify in response to a subpoena was resolved without further litigation after Barack Obama succeeded Mr. Bush as president.

Texto completo: Thirty-four years ago in Moscow I watched the government mishandle a disaster. Why does it feel like it was just yesterday?
It seems terribly wrong that so fine a spring day should be carrying a deadly danger. The daffodils and cherry blossoms proclaim renewal and hope; the crisp, clear air seems incapable of anything so treacherous.
Yet we walk in fear. We want to scrub ourselves again and again against the invisible attacker; we wonder where to hide, how to escape. What can we give our children to protect them? Should we stock up on food and toilet paper? Can we trust the government, which seems bent on making soothing sounds and putting blame elsewhere?
It's the spring of 1986, and I'm in Moscow with my family as The Times's bureau chief. Since April 26, when a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant erupted and spewed radioactivity far and wide, we have been wrestling anxiously with the unknown -- as reporters, trying to distinguish fact from propaganda; personally, trying to cope with a threat that rides silently and invisibly with the wind.
Today's threat is different, of course. Radioactivity is not a pathogen. The coronavirus can spread from continent to continent as fast as a jetliner can fly and from person to person with an unguarded touch; the fallout from the burning Chernobyl plant traveled only as far as the winds would carry it, and social distancing was useless against its radiation.
Still, these disasters have their common impact. There is that terrible feeling of vulnerability before an invisible enemy; that fear that it might already have invaded you; the realization that our science has been caught off guard and our political leaders may have priorities different from ours.
Chernobyl struck at a critical juncture in Soviet history, only a month after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power with the promise of reforming the stultifying police state through "glasnost" and "perestroika," openness and reconstruction. Yet when a reactor in Ukraine exploded and started spewing lethal radiation, the Soviet system quickly reverted to old habits of self-serving lies, manipulation of information and secrecy.
Hours passed before the Kremlin even acknowledged an accident, long after officials in parts of Scandinavia began reporting ominous increases in radiation. The first official bulletin remains a classic in totalitarian understatement: "An accident has occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as one of the reactors was damaged. Measures are being taken to eliminate the consequences of the accident. Aid is being given to those affected. A government commission has been set up."
People knew enough to read between the lines: "commission," "measures still being taken" and the terseness all spelled catastrophe. People understood that their lives were in danger, and that fear surpassed the fears by which the state exercised its control. The propaganda machine lost control of the narrative and found itself compelled to dribble out facts and warnings, though the old habit of blaming the West remained in place -- as it does to this day -- with claims that Americans and Western Europeans were exploiting Chernobyl to undermine Soviet credibility and foment a "campaign of hatred." It was weeks before Mr. Gorbachev publicly acknowledged the disaster.
Not surprisingly, China's authoritarian government had many of the same reactions as the Kremlin to the initial spread of the coronavirus in Wuhan. But Beijing's ability to control information was far smaller than the Soviet Union's in the predigital era. The public adulation for Dr. Li Wenliang, a doctor whose early warning about the outbreak of the disease was met with official accusations of "severely disturbing the social order" and who died of the disease, demonstrated the futility of trying to control bad news -- but also the danger, since heeding Dr. Li's warning more quickly might have led to earlier and better efforts to contain the virus.
President Trump's efforts to spin the pandemic away so it wouldn't hurt his re-election chances are far more futile than China's, since a robust news media, a strong medical establishment, local governments and independent legislators are not cowed by his accusations that the disease "is their new hoax." Americans threatened by the outbreak, like the Soviet people in 1986 or the Chinese in 2020, will not be fooled for long when their lives are threatened.
Still, it's discouraging that the president began to acknowledge the gravity of the coronavirus only after his efforts at denial went nowhere, and that even so important a speech included misinformation such as his claim that antiviral therapies would soon be available. And, of course, there was that familiar attempt to depict the virus as something foreigners were inflicting on Americans.
In the Soviet Union, Chernobyl proved to be a seminal moment for a system already on life support, hastening its demise. The handling of the coronavirus will have its time of reckoning, too, and the pandemic is certain to leave a deep imprint on afflicted regions of the world, including our country.
Back in 1986 all such analyses began later, after the danger subsided. In the immediate aftermath, the questions were far more immediate, as they are in these early days of spring. Dare I ride the subway? How will we get food if we're quarantined at home? Is my will up to date? Are we being told the truth?

Texto completo: An official said she hoped that up to 5,000 migrants would participate in the voluntary scheme, which had caveats.
LONDON -- Thousands of migrants who have been stranded on Greek islands will be offered 2,000 euros, or $ 2,230, to return to their home countries, the European Union said on Thursday, in an attempt to ease overcrowding in the camps and lighten the burden on Greece, which has faced an influx of arrivals in recent weeks.
During a visit in Athens, the European Union's commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, said she hoped that up to 5,000 migrants would participate in the voluntary return scheme.
"This is an opportunity to release a bit the pressure on the islands and for the other people that are still in the camps," Ms. Johansson said on Thursday about the program.
The scheme will remain open for a month and will be available only to those who arrived in Greece before Jan. 1.
But even if thousands take up the offer, the announcement appears limited, as tens of thousands of migrants remain in Greece, including more than 40,000 on five islands, including Lesbos and Samos, where they live in squalid conditions.
More than 40,000 people arrived in Greece in the last quarter of 2019, according to United Nations data, most of them by sea.
The scheme offered by the European Union and put in place with the International Organization for Migration won't apply to the thousands of migrants who also reached Greece after Turkey opened its border last month. The move prompted the Greek authorities to deploy its military, suspend new asylum applications and even round up and summarily expel migrants.
The mood among the Greek authorities and the country's citizens over the migrant influx has shifted since 2015, when Greeks showed compassion and generosity as more than a million asylum seekers reached Europe.
On the border islands, like Lesbos, residents have set up roadblocks to prevent migrants from reaching camps, when civilian patrols don't round them up. Villagers have attacked aid workers and journalists who have been seen as helping migrants.
Although the Greek authorities welcomed the announcement on Thursday, they have in recent weeks urged the European Union to provide more support, including that other member states handle asylum seekers directly and process applications in their countries so that Greece's own asylum system doesn't remain clogged up.
On Thursday, Ms. Johansson also said that seven E.U. countries would relocate 1,600 unaccompanied minors and that Greece would host a conference on children and unaccompanied minors in May.
But she warned officials that Greece should uphold its right to asylum, saying that "we can't suspend it," as it is protected by European Union and international law.
Ms. Johansson also said she wanted to discuss a detention center whose existence was revealed by The New York Times on Tuesday. "These kind of temporary detentions that they have set up," she said, according to The Guardian, "is one of the things I would like to know more about."
The thousands of euros that would be provided to migrants under the voluntary scheme is nearly five times more than the €370 stipend offered by the International Organization for Migration through a return program that began in 2016 and that has benefited thousands.
Earlier this month, the European Union promised €700,000 ( $ 780,000) in emergency aid for Greece, which the European Commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, called "Europe's shield."
The European Union has also sent 160 additional asylum experts to Greece in order to support the authorities handling applications.
The newly offered sum would not apply to refugees who fled war-torn countries like Syria, but only to migrants whose chances at gaining asylum in Europe are slim. Most of those who have arrived since the beginning of the year came from Syria, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency.
Voluntary return schemes have been well-established mechanisms in several countries across Europe, including Belgium and France, which offers up to €1,850 to those who entered the country illegally and wish to return home.
On Thursday, Ms. Johansson noted that Greece's borders were the European Union's, and urged members states to do more.
"When it comes to migration, we are much, much better prepared than in 2015," she said. "But we're not well prepared enough. We're still lacking a common policy for European migration and asylum."

Iraq Fumes, Blaming U.S. Airstrikes for Deaths of Soldiers and Police Officers

Texto completo: Iraqi officers said that the retaliatory strikes against pro-Iranian militias instead hit regular forces, police officers and a civilian.
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi military officials strongly condemned the United States military on Friday for airstrikes launched overnight that they said killed three Iraqi soldiers, two police officers and a civilian worker, and damaged an unfinished civilian airport.
American officials said Friday that the strikes had hit five sites where rockets and other weapons were stored by an Iranian-backed militia, Kataib Hezbollah. But according to multiple Iraqi military officials, who until now had been largely supportive of the U.S. role in Iraq, the bombings killed members of the Iraqi military and police.
American officials said Kataib Hezbollah fighters were also killed in the airstrikes but they could not yet say how many.
The strikes were retaliation for a rocket attack on Wednesday that killed two Americans and a British soldier and wounded 14 others at Camp Taji, an Iraqi military base north of Baghdad, American officials said.
In a statement on Friday, the Iraqi Joint Command described the American airstrikes as "an aggression" that "targeted Iraqi military institutions violating the principal of partnership" between the Iraqi security forces and the Americans.
This attack "cost the lives of Iraqi fighters while they were doing their military duty," the statement said.
At a news conference at the Pentagon on Friday, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, the head of the military's Central Command, said the American strikes were in self-defense to destroy rockets and other weapons that he said had been supplied by Iran and that could be used against American and allied troops in Iraq.
He said one of the five sites attacked was a weapons storage site at an airfield in Karbala, south of Baghdad, which had been destroyed.
The Iraqi military statement said the airport that was hit was "totally civilian" and all workers there were civilians.
In Karbala, officials involved in the airport's construction said that an airport worker was killed and several others were wounded.
The man who was killed, Karrar Sabbar, was 23 years old and left behind a wife and two children. He worked as a guard, sleeping in one of the airport's halls or one of the administrative buildings.
Witnesses including a New York Times reporter noted that while the damage from the strikes was clear nothing appeared to have been burned, not even the papers that were in one of the administrative office areas that were hit.
If the facility had been used for ammunition storage, it would have been likely to have caused a fire.
General McKenzie said he did not yet have details on the overall number of casualties from strikes at the five locations, mostly south and southeast of Baghdad.
He said that American officials had consulted with their Iraqi counterparts after the fatal rocket attack on Wednesday and that they knew an American response was coming.
He and other American military officials were dismissive of the Iraqi complaints, given that Iraqi soldiers and police officers often share bases with Iranian-backed militias like Kataib Hezbollah.
"I don't know whether the Iraqis are happy or unhappy," General McKenzie said. "These locations that we struck are clear locations of terrorist bases. If Iraqi military forces were there, I would say it's probably not a good idea to position yourself with Kataib Hezbollah in the wake of a strike that killed Americans and coalition members."
A military official said United States was not expecting to strike any Iraqi soldiers or police officers at the weapons storage sites, but the results of the strike were still being assessed. The Iraqi report of casualties will be investigated, the official said.
General McKenzie said that the threat from Iran and its proxies remained "very high," adding that tensions "have actually not gone down" since the United States killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian commander, in January.
And while there is no clear evidence yet that Iran specifically directed Wednesday's deadly rocket attack, Kataib Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds Force coordinate closely, the U.S. official said.
General McKenzie said the United States was poised to strike additional militia weapons storage sites and other targets should attacks against American forces continue.
He blamed Kataib Hezbollah for about a dozen rocket attacks against American troops based in Iraq in the past six months, with Wednesday's volley of more than a dozen 107-millimeter rockets being one of the largest.
To increase American firepower and deterrent strength, General McKenzie said, two American aircraft carriers -- the Eisenhower and the Truman -- will remain in the Middle East region for the foreseeable future. Patriot antimissile batteries and other weapons are also flowing into Iraq in the coming weeks, he said.
Separately, the Pentagon identified the two Americans killed in Wednesday's rocket attack as the Army's Spc. Juan Miguel Mendez Covarrubias, 27, of Hanford, Calif., and the Air Force's Staff Sgt. Marshal D. Roberts, 28, of Owasso, Okla.
Kataib Hezbollah, which denied carrying out the rocket attack on Wednesday but praised it, had no comment on Friday on the American retaliation.
The Iraqi Joint Command warned that the latest American attacks not only meant that Iraqi soldiers and police officers had lost their lives, but risked undermining the relationship between the Iraqi military and the Americans, which is primarily focused on the fight against the Islamic State.
It could also worsen the overall security situation by encouraging retaliation against the United States in revenge for the deaths of Iraqi service members and put the Iraqis in a difficult situation. Kataib Hezbollah has called on allied militias to resume "jihadi operations" against the coalition forces and those Iraqis who assist them.
Of potentially greater concern to the Americans would be if the strikes reignited efforts to force the Americans and other coalition troops to leave Iraq.
Each time there are tensions, perceived insults or civilian casualties caused by the Americans, it quickly becomes fodder for anti-American political forces in Iraq, who have the power to oust the Americans if they want to.
The attack on Iraqi forces "presents no solution to control the situation," but will "lead to escalation and deterioration of the security situation in the Iraq, and expose all to more risks and threats," the Iraqi military statement said. "It is an act against the Iraqi state and an aggression on its sovereignty which strengthen the unlawful tendencies."
According to the Iraqis, the airstrikes killed three soldiers from Iraq's Commando Division 19 at a base near Karbala, and wounded four other soldiers. Also killed were two members of an emergency police brigade in Babil Province.
Five members of the Popular Mobilization militias were wounded as well, according to the Iraqi Joint Command. It was unclear if the Popular Mobilization forces in Babil Province were Kataib Hezbollah members and, if so, they might have been among those the Americans intended to target.

Opera Losses From Tickets Pose Threat

Texto completo: The Met, the biggest performing arts organization in the nation, will lose millions in ticket revenues.
During the last few performances before the coronavirus outbreak silenced the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday, posters placed discreetly in the theater's restrooms offered tips for staying healthy: Avoid contact with the sick. Cover coughs. Wash hands.
Keeping the Met financially healthy through the closure, which will extend at least through the end of the month, will be another kind of challenge.
The Met is the largest performing arts organization in the nation: It is a $ 308 million-a-year operation, but a fragile one. The high costs of mounting opera, coupled with weakness at the box office and a relatively small endowment, make it highly dependent on donations. Now, it will lose millions in ticket revenues.
"There is no question that it is of severe financial consequence to the Met not to have performances," said Peter Gelb, the company's general manager, adding that he hoped some people with tickets for canceled performances would donate the money to the Met instead of seeking refunds, and that other donors would also step in to help. "We have an obligation to the world of opera, and to our public, to survive."
The wave of coronavirus closures threaten not just the Met, but also other nonprofit cultural institutions in New York, even the biggest and oldest of which are not necessarily stable. In a bid to shore up revenues, the Metropolitan Museum of Art recently ended its 50-year-old pay-what-you-wish policy for out-of-state residents, and has been cutting expenses after a period of financial turbulence. The New York Philharmonic only recently ended a long streak of deficits, and is working with Lincoln Center to raise money for the renovation of its home, David Geffen Hall, which is expected to cost $ 550 million.
With all these organizations dependent on philanthropy, many are watching the recent downturn in the stock market warily -- wondering how it will impact their donors.
The Met likely faces the loss of between $ 8 million and $ 12 million in box office revenues through the end of the month, and more if the closure continues, as many are beginning to believe it will. The company will continue paying its full-time workers -- including its orchestra and chorus, scenic designers, some stage hands, dressers and others -- at least through this month. Mr. Gelb said that it was unlikely that they would be paid if the closure continued longer, but said that the Met was committed to making sure that those employees continued to have health coverage.
Michael M. Kaiser, the chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the University of Maryland, said that while small organizations faced the greatest risk from closures, large ones are vulnerable, too.
"It depends on how long it goes on for," he said. "It's really a question of duration. If this ends in March it will be a loss, but manageable. But if it goes much beyond that, then it gets to be a really serious financial challenge."
Backstage at the closed opera house, the Met's boardroom has been turned into a war room of sorts, with company officials trying to navigate the human resources logistics associated with shutting down. The development office has been reaching out to donors. And the media department is working on a new initiative: The company plans to begin offering nightly online streams of filmed operas from its extensive catalog, free of charge, beginning Monday at 7:30 p.m. with a 2010 performance of Bizet's "Carmen."
While many of the European opera companies that have closed because of the pandemic receive substantial government funding, American ones rely on private donations and ticket revenues, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the economic impact of closing. On Friday, Lyric Opera of Chicago announced that it was canceling its coming performances of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, an undertaking it has been preparing for years.
The risks of closing go beyond short-term revenue. It can sometimes take years for organizations to build back audiences after interruptions. That has happened before at the Met, where attendance fell after labor battles canceled performances in 1969 and 1980. Once some operagoers broke their habit of regularly attending, they either stopped going or went less often. Major League Baseball struggled with ticket sales for several years after the 1994-95 strike. And New York City Opera never recovered the audience it lost when it closed in 2008 for a season while its theater was renovated: It went bankrupt.
But Mr. Kaiser noted that in all those cases, people had alternate live entertainment options, whereas now virtually everything is closed. "I'm expecting there will be a burst of interest in going out and doing things when we're allowed to again," he said.
The coronavirus crisis hit the Met just as it seemed to be finding a firmer footing after several tumultuous years. There was labor unrest in 2014, when the company won concessions from its unions that it said were necessary for its survival. It weathered sexual abuse allegations that led it to fire its longtime music director, James Levine.
But it has successfully rolled out his successor as music director, the conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who has found favor with audiences and critics. This year the company introduced Sunday matinees; and two new productions, the Gershwins's "Porgy and Bess" and Philip Glass's "Akhnaten," were box office hits.
The Met still faces major financial challenges, though. In November, the outlook on its "A" credit rating was revised to negative by S&P Global Ratings, which warned of "weak balance sheet metrics" and noted that the endowment, valued at $ 284 million in 2018, was "low for an organization of its scope." But Mr. Gelb said that the company was on solid footing, and noted that the box office losses would be partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Still, he said, it was eerie on Thursday night on Met's stage, usually a hive of activity around the clock, on what was supposed to be the opening night of Rossini's sparkling comedy "La Cenerentola."
"I walked across an empty stage, and it was just the ghost light on," Mr. Gelb said, referring to the lone bulb left on in empty theaters. "It was a strange and hollow feeling."

Texto completo: The police are not pursuing criminal charges in an apparent overdose involving a friend of Mr. Gillum's, the former Democratic nominee for Florida governor.
MIAMI -- Andrew Gillum, one of the Democratic Party's fast-rising political stars, was in a Miami Beach hotel room early on Friday when emergency workers were called to treat another man suffering from a probable drug overdose, the police said.
By the time the police arrived at the Mondrian South Beach shortly after midnight, paramedics had treated the man, and he was in stable condition. Officers tried to speak to Mr. Gillum but were unable to "due to his inebriated state," according to an incident report filed by the Miami Beach Police Department. Mr. Gillum was intoxicated and vomiting in the bathroom, according to the report.
The police said they had impounded three small plastic bags "containing suspected crystal meth" that officers saw on both the bed and floor of the hotel room.
"At this time, the incident is not being investigated as a criminal matter," Officer Ernesto Rodriguez, a department spokesman, said in an email.
Mr. Gillum, 40, the former mayor of Tallahassee, is a commentator for CNN. His name has occasionally surfaced as a possible running mate for the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. He leads Forward Florida, an organization he created to register voters after losing the governor's race in 2018 to Ron DeSantis by about 32,000 votes.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Gillum said he was in Miami for a wedding "when first responders were called to assist one of my friends."
"While I had too much to drink, I want to be clear that I have never used methamphetamines," he said. "I apologize to the people of Florida for the distraction this has caused our movement.
"I'm thankful to the incredible Miami Beach EMS team for their efforts," he added. "I will spend the next few weeks with my family and appreciate privacy during this time."
Mr. Gillum and the other man, Travis Dyson, 30, were found by Aldo Mejias, 56, a friend of Mr. Dyson's. In a brief phone interview on Friday morning, an emotional Mr. Mejias said he got to the room shortly after 11 p.m. He was supposed to meet Mr. Dyson to go out on South Beach.
But Mr. Dyson and Mr. Gillum, whom Mr. Mejias said he did not know, had arrived much earlier, at around 6 p.m. After Mr. Dyson let Mr. Mejias into the room, Mr. Dyson collapsed onto the bed, according to the police report. Mr. Mejias performed chest compressions on Mr. Dyson.
"I was seeing very shallow breathing," he said of Mr. Dyson. "The other guy was passed out on the floor, throwing up."
Paramedics took Mr. Dyson to a hospital. He has since been released, Mr. Mejias said.

Hollywood Studios
Halt Production
With most finished movies pulled off the release calendar through the end of April, Hollywood studios started to halt their assembly lines on Friday, beginning with Disney.
The affected Disney projects include a new version of "The Little Mermaid," which was supposed to begin shooting in London next week; "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings," a Marvel superhero film; a remake of "Home Alone," the 1990 comedy; "The Last Duel," a period epic starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; and the big-budget "Peter Pan & Wendy."
Netflix is halting production on all scripted television series and films in the United States and Canada for at least two weeks, according to two people briefed on the plans. This will affect dozens of shows, and it includes projects that are either filming currently or are preparing for production.
Warner Bros. also said on Friday that it was halting production on more than 70 series and pilots that are currently filming. Disney said on Friday it had halted production on two scripted series and 16 pilots. NBC Universal announced late Thursday night it would likewise halt production or accelerate filming to finish production for several series.
EDUCATION
Trump Says He's Waiving
Interest on Student Loans
As part of his emergency declaration on Friday, President Trump said he was waiving interest on tens of millions of student loans held by the federal government until further notice.
How much the waiver saves a borrower will vary depending on the interest rate on their loan. The current range of interest rates on fixed-rate loans to undergraduate and graduate students is 4.53 percent to 7.08 percent.
Those borrowers will still have to make payments on their principal, and it was not immediately clear how quickly the loan servicers who send out the bills will be able to recalculate what each person owes.
The waiver will not affect all borrowers. Student loans issued through state agencies and private lenders are not covered. But the federal government is the biggest holder of student debt with $ 1.2 trillion in direct loans to more than 35 million borrowers.
TECHNOLOGY
How Google Is Going to Help
Google is working with Verily, a life sciences unit of its parent company Alphabet, to direct individuals with a high risk of coronavirus infection to testing sites.
President Trump said on Friday that Google had devoted 1,700 engineers to build a website to help people screen for COVID-19 symptoms and then be directed to testing locations.
The description of the website fits with an initiative described by Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive, in an internal memo sent on Thursday and obtained by The New York Times. A Google representative was not immediately available for comment, and The Times could not independently confirm the company had devoted 1,700 people to the effort.
"A planning effort is underway to use the expertise in life sciences and clinical research of Verily in partnership with Google to aid in the COVID-19 testing effort," Mr. Pichai wrote in the memo.

Religious Freedom Training by Justice Dept. Raises Red Flag for Lawyers

Texto completo: Some department lawyers expressed worries that the workshops were held to teach ways to limit civil rights protections for gay and transgender people.
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department this week hosted training for its lawyers on religious liberty laws as part of Attorney General William P. Barr's push to prioritize religious freedom cases, but the workshops prompted concern among some career lawyers that they were being educated on ways to blunt civil rights protections for gay and transgender people.
Lawyers who worked at the Justice Department during the past three administrations could not recall a similar week of training sessions on any topic.
The training week was part of an ongoing campaign at the department to bolster its work to protect religious freedom, which is regularly described by top leaders as the first right protected by the First Amendment, a department official said in response to a request for comment.
In an email to employees sent on behalf of department leaders last weekend about the training, the department said that its leaders were proud of the work "done over the past year to promote religious freedom," including prosecutions related to land use, education and employment.
Last month, the department filed a statement of interest in federal court in Kentucky that supported the right of a photographer not to work at same-sex weddings; she said it would violate her religious beliefs. And last fall the Justice Department supported an appeals case in Maine, saying that a state law banning religious schools from the state's school tuition program was unconstitutional.
Both filings were a departure from the department's positions under the Obama administration and have drawn criticism from gay rights activists as well as supporters of a sharp separation between church and state.
The training, the first of its kind, was voluntary. It was meant to improve employees' understanding of their own free exercise of religious rights in the workplace, as well as the department's resources for protecting places of worship and individual religious rights, according to the department official.
But career lawyers said that they feared the department was working to further the use of religious freedom in ways that would push back efforts to protect gay and transgender people from discrimination, according to emails and messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Some lawyers cited the department's support of the photographer in Kentucky and its support of a Colorado baker whose refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple was upheld by the Supreme Court. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a Justice Department event to celebrate religious freedom that the baker, Jack Phillips, was courageous and that Western culture was increasingly "less hospitable to people of faith."
Vanita Gupta, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the former head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, accused Mr. Barr of using the Justice Department to promote his religious beliefs.
"In speeches and statements, he says that civil society is being undermined by a move away from religiosity," she said. "He wants to use civil rights statutes and the D.O.J. to redeem what he views as the corrupted soul of America."
The department's civil rights division has also undertaken work more in keeping with past administrations. In January, Mr. Barr also met with Jewish leaders in Brooklyn to discuss a nationwide rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes. Prosecutors also secured a guilty plea from a Louisiana man charged with intentionally setting fire to three black Baptist churches in violation of the Church Arson Prevention Act.
The training sessions focused on topics including protections for religious land use, the religious rights of prisoners, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, protecting places of worship, and the religious liberty rights of employees under federal law.
"Religious liberty is a core American value and a top priority for the department," the department said in the email about the training.
"We pledge to protect the free exercise of religion when we take our oath to 'support and defend the Constitution.' We do so out of respect for the conscience of our fellow citizens and to preserve the civil society in which our liberal democracy can flourish."
The email echoes remarks that Mr. Barr made last month at the National Religious Broadcasters' annual convention, where he said that "Augustinian Christianity" is at the root of the our democracy, and that Americans "providentially enjoy its blessings today."
"In my view, liberal democracy has reached its fullest expression in the Anglo-American political system," Mr. Barr said. "The wellsprings of this system are found in Augustinian Christianity."
Attendees said that no religion was prioritized over another during the training sessions, which were led by departments officials from the office of the principal deputy associate attorney general, Claire McCusker Murray; the Civil Rights Division; the Community Relations Service; and various U.S. attorneys' offices.

Texto completo: Mr. Gates, who founded the company with Paul Allen four decades ago, will also step down from the board of Berkshire Hathaway.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Gates is stepping down from the board of Microsoft, the software giant he helped found more than four decades ago.
Mr. Gates said on Friday that he would also step down from the board of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by his close friend, Warren E. Buffett.
"I have made the decision to step down from both of the public boards on which I serve -- Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway -- to dedicate more time to philanthropic priorities including global health and development, education, and my increasing engagement in tackling climate change," Mr. Gates wrote in a LinkedIn post.
For decades, Mr. Gates was the face of Microsoft. Known for his technical acumen and ruthless business practices, he helped to establish Microsoft's Windows software as the primary system for the personal computer. Microsoft said Mr. Gates would remain a technical adviser to the company.
Mr. Gates has slowly been stepping back from Microsoft in recent years. He left his day-to-day role at the company in 2008 and served as the board's chairman until 2014.
The company said he wants to devote more of his time to his philanthropy at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world's biggest nonprofit organizations, which was started with the billions of dollars he made from Microsoft.
Mr. Gates remains one of the largest individual shareholders of Microsoft. As of December, he held more than 100 million shares of Microsoft, roughly 1.3 percent of the company's shares. His stock is worth about $ 16 billion. He said he would remain active at the company and would work closely with Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive.
"Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work and I will continue to be engaged with Satya and the technical leadership to help shape the vision and achieve the company's ambitious goals. I feel more optimistic than ever about the progress the company is making," Mr. Gates wrote in his post.
In his post-Microsoft career, Mr. Gates has become better known for his work in fighting infectious diseases and climate change. Last month, the Gates Foundation said it would commit an additional $ 100 million to fight the coronavirus. The organization pledged $ 10 million earlier in the year.
He has persuaded Mr. Buffett, his bridge partner and neighbor on the list of the world's richest people, to donate most of his fortune to the Gates Foundation.
Mr. Gates joined the Berkshire Hathaway board in 2004. The conglomerate has nominated Kenneth Chenault, the former chief executive of American Express, to replace Mr. Gates on the board.
Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said in a research note that Mr. Gates's stepping down from the Microsoft board was not a surprise and that it was a vote of confidence for Mr. Nadella and the direction of the company.
Mr. Gates founded Microsoft in 1975, dropping out of Harvard and joining Paul Allen, his friend and technology collaborator since their teenage years at a private high school in Seattle. In 1975, they moved to Albuquerque, N.M., where a fledgling microcomputer company, MITS, made the Altair 8800, a primitive machine often credited as the first personal computer.
Microsoft's first product was a version of the BASIC programming language that could run on the underpowered Altair computer. That was the start. Later, after Mr. Gates moved Microsoft to suburban Seattle, a succession of highly successful commercial products followed -- the MS-DOS operating system, the Windows operating system and the Office collection of productivity programs, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
By the mid-1990s, Microsoft was the dominant personal computer software company, so much so that it became the target of a series of antitrust investigations. In a landmark federal case, a lawsuit filed in 1998, Microsoft was eventually found to have repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws.
Mr. Gates stepped aside as chief executive in 2000, after the antitrust ruling. In recent years, his main occupation has been as a philanthropist, donating billions to world health and disease eradication programs.
But the antitrust battle of 1990s still rankles Mr. Gates. At a New York Times DealBook conference last fall, he was asked if the suit made the technology market more competitive. "No," Mr. Gates replied. "Everyone else can say that if they want. It's not true to me, and I will never change that opinion."

Texto completo: The country is winding down an aggressive two-week operation to move tens of thousands of migrants to its frontiers. But relations with Greece and Europe have suffered.
BRUSSELS -- Turkey has signaled that it is winding down its two-week operation to aid the movement of tens of thousands of people toward Europe, following a tough on-the-ground response from Greek border guards and a tepid diplomatic reaction from European politicians.
Migrants at the Greek-Turkish land border began to be transported back to Istanbul by bus this week, witnesses at the border said, de-escalating a standoff that initially set off fears of another European migration crisis. Greek officials said the number of attempted border crossings had dwindled from thousands a day to a few hundred, and none were successful on Friday, even as sporadic exchanges of tear-gas with Turkish security forces continued.
Also Friday, Turkish officials announced that three human smugglers had each been sentenced to 125 years in prison for their roles in the death of a Syrian toddler, Alan Kurdi, whose drowning came to epitomize an earlier migration crisis, in 2015.
That announcement and the week's other developments were interpreted by experts and European politicians as signals to Europe that the Turkish authorities were once again willing to police their borders and quell a second wave of migration.
It follows a tense period in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey attempted to engineer the reverse: a new migration crisis on Europe's borders.
On Feb. 28, the Turkish government announced it would no longer stop migrants trying to reach Europe, and it then drove hundreds to the threshold of Greece, live-streaming the process to encourage more to follow.
The move was perceived as an attempt to rally European support for Turkey's military campaign in northern Syria, and more European aid for the four million refugees inside Turkey.
On at least one occasion, Turkish officials even forced migrants to leave. In a video clip filmed onboard a bus ferrying people to the border, reluctant migrants were shown being forced off the vehicle at gunpoint by officers in plain clothes, and beaten when they resisted.
Marc Pierini, a former European Union envoy to Turkey, called it "the first-ever refugee exodus, albeit a limited one, fully organized by one government against another."
The border clash not only stirred fears of a new migration crisis, but it also saw both countries react with anger and tough tactics. The Greeks have been condemned for suspending asylum applications and detaining and returning some migrants to Turkey.
To foment a sense of crisis, Turkish security forces fired tear gas over the border at their Greek counterparts and provided journalists with footage of aggressive Greek responses to migrants. Mr. Erdogan accused Greek officials of behaving like officials in Nazi Germany.
But the Turks used aggressive tactics of their own.
Footage captured by The New York Times showed Turkish security forces standing aside to allow migrants to tear down part of a fence dividing Turkey and Greece. And other footage emerged of a Turkish vessel pursuing a Greek coast guard vessel in the Aegean, and of a Turkish armored vehicle ramming a border fence between the two countries.
The Turkish Interior Ministry then sent more guards to the border -- not to prevent people from leaving without documents, but to stop Greece from returning them by force, according to the Turkish interior minister, Suleyman Soylu.
The confrontation marked a low point in relations between two neighbors who have long had a fragile coexistence within NATO, and it threatened to upend a fine balance in the strategically important, energy-rich southeastern Mediterranean.
It also brought front and center the European Union's dependence on Turkey to limit the movement of migrants toward its territory, as well as Mr. Erdogan's willingness to weaponize migrants for his own purposes.
But experts said Mr. Erdogan's mobilization of migrants and security forces at the borders with Europe could have backfired, being so provocative that it may have made European politicians less willing to make concessions.
"The problem is that because of the blackmail used by Turkey, getting an agreement from the European Council is going to be more difficult," said Mr. Pierini, who is now an analyst for Carnegie Europe, a research organization.
The European Union in 2016 agreed to funnel 6 billion euros to organizations helping the nearly four million Syrian refugees in Turkey, in exchange for Turkey's help in securing its borders with Greece.
That deal came after nearly one million refugees left Turkey for Greece, allowing them to reach the Continent's prosperous north relatively easily.
But Turkey has complained that European funding has been slow in coming, and has been paid to aid groups as well as into its own government coffers, making it less efficient. At a meeting in Brussels this week, European Union leaders discussed with Mr. Erdogan whether the agreement would be extended and how to restore it.
Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the meeting with Mr. Erdogan on Monday had been a "good start" in restoring normalcy at the Greek-Turkish borders.
"Migrants need support, Greece needs support but also Turkey needs support, and this involves finding a path forward with Turkey," she said. "Clearly we have our disagreements but we have spoken plainly and we have spoken openly to each other about these."
The European Union is likely to eventually agree to send more money to Turkey to help with challenges posed by the refugee influx, Mr. Pierini said.
But European leaders have taken a dim view of Mr. Erdogan's latest showmanship, and may have become even more reluctant to accede to other Turkish diplomatic priorities, Mr. Pierini added. Those include an expansion of the Turkey's joint customs union with Europe, and further visa reforms for Turkish nationals.
The awkward coexistence between Greece and Turkey since the mid-1990s, when the two countries came close to war, could be at even greater risk of lasting damage.
"Greek-Turkish détente has been one of the cornerstones of geostrategic relations in the southeastern Mediterranean -- and the potential of this collapsing is alarming to the region and Western allies," said Ian Lesser, the vice president of the German Marshall Fund.
He said that the escalation had unleashed forces that may not be easy to manage.
"Once someone opens up Pandora's box, in an environment when you have proxy groups, coast guards, criminal traffickers, many actors who may not be fully under the control of governments, there is always the potential to go wrong," Mr. Lesser said.
"That's true in Syria but it's also true on the Greek-Turkish border," he added.

Texto completo: Our homebound writers choose their favorite recordings of works they were scheduled to hear live.
With concert halls and opera houses closed around the world as part of bans on large gatherings aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak, what are homebound classical critics to do? Listen to favorite recordings of the music they were scheduled to hear live, of course! Enjoy.
Brahms, Piano Concerto No. 1
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The young conductor Lahav Shani was slated to make his New York debut on Sunday leading the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra in Brahms at David Geffen Hall. I was especially looking forward to hearing the Piano Concerto No. 1, with Emanuel Ax as soloist. Lately I've been listening to one of my favorite recordings of the work: from 1985, featuring the great pianist Peter Serkin, who died in February at 72, playing with Robert Shaw and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Serkin conveys the music's Romantic fervor while playing with lucid clarity; listen to the Bach-like textures of the finale. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Duke Ellington, 'Black, Brown and Beige'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The jazz pianist Marcus Roberts has had success with his improvisatory approach to orchestral works by Gershwin and James P. Johnson, and he ought to be a frequent guest soloist with top classical ensembles. The American Symphony Orchestra had planned do its part on Thursday, with an Ellington concert at Carnegie Hall boasting new arrangements by Mr. Roberts. So I've turned to a fresh recording of Ellington's "Black, Brown and Beige," released to digital platforms by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra earlier this month. It's a rare full recording of Ellington's original vision of this extended work, which its composer debuted at Carnegie Hall in 1943. Start at the beginning. SETH COLTER WALLS
Meredith Monk, 'Double Fiesta'
The vocalist-composer Meredith Monk was scheduled to play at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., later this month. But her many fans need not despair too much: The project she was set to unveil, "Memory Game," will be released on record at the end of the month and features arrangements of excerpts from her past works. David Lang's version of "Double Fiesta" moves the piece into a more rockish space. But Ms. Monk sounds more than comfortable during the final, hurtling minute of this new recording -- with pursed-lip vibrations capable of meeting the intensity of the guitarist Mark Stewart and the cellist Ashley Bathgate. SETH COLTER WALLS
John Adams, 'I Still Dance'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The San Francisco Symphony's season opened with a premiere in tribute to its outgoing music director, Michael Tilson Thomas. That piece, John Adams's "I Still Dance," was also meant to travel with the orchestra on its final tour under Mr. Thomas, including a now-canceled visit to Carnegie Hall next week. It's a sadly quiet ending to what has been a transformative tenure for this conductor, captured with propulsive vigor in Mr. Adams's brief but mind-bogglingly dense piece. This is vintage Adams -- the heft of "Harmonielehre" and the rhythmic drive of "Short Ride in a Fast Machine" -- yet more smoothly intricate. You couldn't take in all of its richly woven textures if you tried; so listen, again and again, to see why Mr. Adams is our reigning master of orchestral writing. Like Mr. Thomas, he's still got it. JOSHUA BARONE
Mahler, Sixth Symphony
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Like his mentor, Leonard Bernstein, Mr. Thomas has been a superb Mahler conductor. He turned the San Francisco Symphony into a West Coast hotbed of this composer, giving performances of the symphonies that brought uncanny balance to these extreme scores. Both a 2001 recording of the Sixth Symphony and a new one, captured live and just released, offer plenty of passion yet also structural coherence. You won't be disappointed with either option, though I'm sorry to not be hearing them play it at Carnegie. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Bach, 'The Art of Fugue'
Perhaps the prospect of hearing Daniil Trifonov make his way through "The Art of Fugue," as he was scheduled to do at Symphony Hall in Boston on Sunday, was always a little outlandish. With its indeterminate instrumentation and its tinge of academe, few pianists have taken it up with ease or regularity -- and fewer still of Mr. Trifonov's imagination. One who has is Pierre-Laurent Aimard, who is as committed to his Bach as he is to his Boulez; Mr. Aimard's recording on Deutsche Grammophon was set down well over a decade ago, but remains a model of clarity and intelligence, if not of introspection. DAVID ALLEN
Rossini, 'La Cenerentola'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I try not to pass up the opportunity to hear the honey-voiced bel canto tenor Javier Camarena, who was to open this charming Cinderella work at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening. (We'll see what happens: The final performance, on April 3, is still tentatively on.) I was expecting Mr. Camarena, who returns to the Met next season in Bellini's "Il Pirata," to once again garner ovations with his big aria, "Si, ritrovarla io giuro." Perhaps the audiences would have even demanded encores, as they did when he sang it here in 2014. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Rachmaninoff, Piano Concerto No. 3
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The New York Philharmonic had already announced a replacement pianist for this week's performances of Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto, under Valery Gergiev, and I was eager to hear George Li, 24, play this daunting repertory staple. Among many superb recordings, my favorite may be Van Cliburn's from 1958, with Kirill Kondrashin leading the Symphony of the Air. Cliburn's playing is rhapsodic, yet also refreshingly direct and clearheaded, offering a young American's take on an iconic Russian work. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Anthony Braxton, Composition No. 368e, 364c
Anthony Braxton, a vital player and composer, was scheduled to present three concerts at Big Ears in Knoxville. In addition to the debut of his "Thunder Music" group, Mr. Braxton's famed solo-saxophone act was on the bill. Less well known is his graphic-score-meets-electronic-music system, "Diamond Curtain Wall Music." An online-only release from his foundation -- documenting a 2011 trio performance with the guitarist Mary Halvorson and the brass player Taylor Ho Bynum -- offers an intense and immersive experience of this side of Mr. Braxton's art. SETH COLTER WALLS
John Zorn, Quartets
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The JACK Quartet know how to do a marathon. Few concerts last year could match the group's mind-expanding cycle of Elliott Carter's five string quartets. And this weekend, they were supposed to present John Zorn's complete, knotty quartets, over two evenings. The first program would have ended with "The Alchemist," which opened JACK's shorter Zorn survey at the Ojai Music Festival in June. Mystical and eerie, with a flash of Beethoven's Grosse Fuge, the piece is a bracing glimpse into Mr. Zorn's world of psychedelic color and wide-ranging inspiration. JOSHUA BARONE
Bach, Suites for Solo ... Violin?
It may feel as if the world doesn't need yet another recording of Bach's solo works for violin or cello. But Johnny Gandelsman's contributions feel necessary. His 2018 collection of the violin sonatas and partitas was revelatory in its unpretentious lightness and dancing energy. Then he went back to the studio for a transcribed version of the six cello suites, whose instrument-specific idiosyncrasies seem antithetical to the violin. Yet listen to his brisk interpretations -- coming in about half an hour shorter than a typical cycle -- and hear how Mr. Gandelsman doesn't even attempt to replicate the cello's character. These are radically weightless, at times seemingly improvisatory, and completely grounded in dance. JOSHUA BARONE

What Does Declaration From Trump Actually Do?

Texto completo: The president's action will free up funds and lower legal barriers for responding to the pandemic.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Friday signed an emergency declaration over the coronavirus pandemic, unlocking certain government powers to deal with the public health challenge. Here's a breakdown of what that means on a legal and practical level.
What is emergency power?
It's special authority that a president can unlock and use in exigent circumstances.
Congress has enacted more than 100 laws that permit a president to declare that emergencies exist, freeing the government from abiding by some of its usual legal constraints. This flexibility can include permitting the federal government to spend additional funds, including to aid state and local governments, and temporarily lowering legal barriers to certain actions.
In some cases, an umbrella law called the National Emergencies Act that regulates how presidents can use exigent power must be invoked to use another, setting up a complex cascade of effects. In public health, emergency power laws include provisions of the Public Health Service Act, the Stafford Act, the Social Security Act and other statutes.
How does a Stafford Act emergency work?
It frees up federal funds and other resources to help when "federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety."
The Stafford Act is the government's main mechanism for responding to major disasters and emergencies. It permits tapping into an account that currently has more than $ 40 billion, which it could use to do things like buy medical supplies and equipment.
If a president grants a declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can coordinate a response. The act also empowers the president to direct any federal agency to use its personnel, facilities and equipment to support state and local emergency efforts, disseminate public health and safety information, provide public health and safety measures, and distribute supplies like medicine and food.
While the Stafford Act is more often activated in cases of major disasters that cause property damage, like hurricanes and floods, it has also been used in public health emergencies. In 2000, President Bill Clinton used it to cover mosquito control operations in New Jersey and New York during the outbreak of the West Nile virus.
Wasn't there already an emergency determination?
Yes, but it was under a less sweeping law.
On Jan. 31, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of Health and Human Services, determined that an emergency existed under the Public Health Service Act. The determination made it easier for state and local health departments to temporarily reassign personnel whose salaries were funded through federal public health programs, freeing them from regular duties to help respond to the pandemic.
What about the Social Security Act?
Mr. Trump's move will also unlock extra powers under Section 1135 of the Social Security Act aimed at making it easier to get medical supplies and doctors and nurses where they are needed most.
The provision permits waiving requirements in Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program that normally apply. The waivers include payment limitations on using out-of-network providers, certain certification requirements and a federal mandate that doctors be licensed in the state in which they are practicing.
At his news conference, Mr. Trump gave an example of "telehealth," or letting doctors in one state consult online with patients in another state.
The waiver power under the Social Security Act requires both a determination under the Public Health Service Act by the health and human services secretary and a presidential declaration under either the Stafford Act or the National Emergencies Act.
In 2009, President Barack Obama declared a national emergency -- under the latter law rather than using the Stafford Act -- in part to unlock Section 1135 powers as part of the government's response to the H1N1 epidemic, also known as the swine flu.
Is this different from the emergency Trump declared over the border wall?
Yes, at least as a matter of policy substance and politics.
Serious commentators agree that the coronavirus pandemic presents a true emergency and fits within the intent of Congress in creating national emergency powers laws. But Mr. Trump's claim that an emergency existed at the border that could be solved by a wall was widely disputed.
Mr. Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration, in contrast to his Mexico border wall declaration, fit the purpose of emergency powers laws, said Elizabeth Goitein, a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. She oversaw a study in 2018 of presidential emergency powers.
"In contrast to the situation at the border wall, which was in no way an emergency and the president's declaration went against Congress's will," she said, "this is a situation where we face a true emergency and members of Congress have actually been encouraging the president to take this action."

Texto completo: This week, we took our work home with us.
By the middle of this week, The Times had made it official: It wanted employees to begin working from home by Friday to limit potential exposure to the coronavirus.
It was a big change for everybody, including "The Daily." How would we make the show without being in the office?
By Tuesday we had put in place an experiment in which we tried producing the show remotely. Our morning meeting was held over a Google Hangout. Many of our conversations were conducted via Slack messages. We brainstormed about scripts in conference calls.
The trickiest part: conducting the interviews themselves, the heart of the show. On Tuesday, when we spoke with the investigative reporter Sheri Fink about shortcomings in the U.S. coronavirus testing system, she was in the office with the producer Robert Jimison, who volunteered to run the studio session. Everybody else on our team was working remotely.
It worked. We tried it again for Thursday's conversation with Donald G. McNeil Jr., about the different ways that countries around the world are confronting the pandemic, a conversation that began with Donald disinfecting our studio.
By Friday, Donald himself was working from home, a slightly new challenge. We decided to connect to him via Google Hangout so he could hear me and the producers working remotely. The producer Clare Toeniskoetter, who lives near Donald, biked to his house with a recorder to capture the scene, including her own hand-washing routine, and to record Donald's side of the interview in high-quality audio.
Times reporters and "Daily" producers will continue to report on the coronavirus from the field, taking every possible precaution to limit their exposure and staying in close consultation with leaders of The Times.
We're not entirely sure what the next few weeks will bring in this fast-evolving situation. But we're determined to keep covering the story of this pandemic, a story of enormous consequence that requires as much information and perspective as possible.
And we want to hear from you. At the end of Friday's show, we asked for your questions about the virus and how to navigate this new reality. Leave us a voice message at 646-598-6012. And be sure to tell us your name and where you're calling from.

'I'm glad she's still my senator'
For Tuesday's episode of "The Field," our producers Jessica Cheung and Austin Mitchell traveled to Massachusetts with Astead Herndon, a political reporter for The Times. The team wanted to understand how Elizabeth Warren's campaign unraveled, and broadly, how a contest that started with "historic diversity" has come down to a race between "two men, 70 plus, both white."
Jessica shared why they were driven to make this episode, and how they found one of the voters that you heard from:
"After seeing Warren drop out of the race outside her house -- the same place she announced her bid for the presidency -- we wondered how she went from front-runner status to finishing so behind, not only in the early state races, but also in her home state.
So we did a statewide search for a voter who could articulate their love for Warren, and how they felt when she dropped out of the race. I spoke to about a dozen voters, but when I read an old Boston Globe article, I knew I wanted to talk to one named Lyn Licciardello.
Lyn was quoted in the article as someone who showed up to the polls to vote for Warren in her first Senate run. How did she, a Warren supporter from the beginning, feel now?
Lyn began to cry on the phone when she talked about watching Warren drop out. 'I cried through the whole thing,' Lyn said. 'It was horrible to see. But I'm glad she's still my senator. She's the best senator there is."'
You can listen to the story here or by searching for "The Field" wherever you get your podcasts.
And below, some photos from Massachusetts:
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: A case before the Supreme Court is testing reproductive rights in Louisiana, where there are three abortion clinics left. Adam Liptak visits the clinic at the center of the case.
Tuesday: "I'm left to wonder, how did we get here?" On an episode of "The Field," Astead Herndon travels to Massachusetts to understand how Elizabeth Warren went from once leading in the polls to dropping out of the race.
Wednesday: Developing a strategy for testing was supposed to be a relatively simple part of preparing for the coronavirus in the United States. Sheri Fink explains what went wrong.
Thursday: Donald G. McNeil Jr. on the countries that have been successful in bringing the pandemic under control: "They've done something that nobody else has ever done before."
Friday: How long can a person expect to be sick once diagnosed with coronavirus? Are trips to the movies, grocery stores and gyms OK? Donald G. McNeil Jr. answers our questions about how to live safely amid the pandemic.

Texto completo: The big drug distributors would pay $ 19.2 billion over 18 years. Some 30 states have signed on so far but most cities and counties hate the deal.
The three giant drug distributors are negotiating a deal with the states to end thousands of opioid lawsuits nationwide, in which they would pay $ 19.2 billion over 18 years and immediately submit to stringent monitoring requirements to assure that suspicious orders for prescription opioids would be halted.
But although pressure is building to settle the costly, protracted litigation and bring relief to communities hit hard by addiction and overdose deaths, another group of plaintiffs is objecting strongly to the terms of the deal. Cities and counties, which have brought far more cases than state governments, say they are being blindsided by state attorneys general because the proposed agreement would give states control over the money that would trickle down to them.
So far, 31 states plus the District of Columbia have tentatively agreed to the deal, while 19 states, including Florida, Connecticut and West Virginia, have not.
According to a confidential 21-page outline of the deal obtained by The New York Times, the companies would pay in full only when all plaintiffs -- including the cities and counties -- have withdrawn their lawsuits. Even after a majority of states sign up, the companies would guarantee payment of just 55 percent of the money and would release the remaining 45 percent only when each state can confirm that its cities and counties are on board.
Although the companies would prefer that the municipalities sign on of their own accord, the proposal stipulates that states could compel them to comply through legislation or their courts.
In lawyers' parlance, this type of deal is known as a "cramdown." The perception is that it is being crammed down from the most powerful plaintiffs to those on a lower rung.
"The focus on the ability of the states to somehow drag the counties along or eliminate their rights by legislation or court rulings seems completely unbalanced," said Paul J. Hanly Jr., a lawyer on the negotiating committee for the municipalities. He noted that the municipalities have not even been shown the most recent proposal.
The contentiousness between two muscular groups of plaintiffs has long been building. Years before the states had even begun to sue, Mr. Hanly noted, lawyers for the cities and counties had already spent millions of dollars and hours in opioid litigation. Moreover, many states have not even yet sued the distributors in their opioid lawsuits; most target manufacturers.
Mr. Hanly also took issue with the 18-year payment period. The amount of money proposed would be acceptable, he said, "if it were paid over one, two or three years. But over a generation is too little, too long."
But state attorneys general who favor the proposal say it offers immediate relief to the public.
"The costs of litigation, both financial and personal -- like overdose deaths -- only multiply with time," the Tennessee attorney general, Herbert H. Slatery III, a Republican, said in a statement. "The current framework gets funds to communities in 2020."
Laura Brewer, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina attorney general, Josh Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement: "It will also put strict new rules in place to help make sure that a crisis like this doesn't happen again."
On Wednesday, Ohio, ravaged by the opioid epidemic, became the first state to announce that its attorney general, Dave Yost, and most of its communities would cooperate when opioid settlement offers are finalized. For now, Mr. Yost opposes the distributors' proposal.
Between 2006 and 2014, the distributors -- McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health -- shipped more than 60 billion opioid pills nationwide. The states and the cities allege that the companies turned a blind eye to outsized orders and even encouraged them. For years, the distributors, routinely appearing on lists of the wealthiest American corporations, have characterized themselves as mere middlemen between pharmacies and manufacturers.
Their proposed $ 19.2 billion total payout designates $ 1.2 billion for private lawyers who represent municipalities and even some states in the opioid cases.
Some states have asked that perhaps $ 500 million of that amount cover the states' legal costs.
The contours of the deal, absent the new leverage controls and extra money for lawyers' fees, were proposed in October. At that time, four attorneys general announced that Johnson & Johnson, the health care giant that manufactures opioids through its pharmaceutical division, would contribute $ 4 billion in the first three years -- an offer that still stands.
If this proposal does go forward, the entire package would come to $ 23.2 billion, including lawyers' fees.
After the October announcement, most states were dismissive. In recent weeks, however, with legal fees tacked on, states have begun to sign up.
Another pressure to settle was a looming March 20 trial brought by the State of New York and Suffolk and Nassau Counties against the distributors as well as some opioid manufacturers. Earlier this week, the trial date was delayed over concerns about coronavirus.
Letitia James, the New York attorney general, a tentative supporter, said in a statement: "As we continue negotiations, a majority of states have signaled their support for a framework that ensures funds move to affected communities as quickly as possible. While no amount of relief will ever make whole the millions of families and communities devastated by the opioid crisis, there is an immediate need to fund prevention, rehabilitation and recovery programs in our state."
Although their revenues are soaring, the distributors say that because their profits are scarcely one percent, they have limited cash on hand.
At a January earnings call to investors, Steven H. Collis, chairman of the board of AmerisourceBergen, was asked whether the company needed to accumulate a war chest to bear the brunt of the opioid settlement.
Mr. Collis responded: "We don't feel the need at all," explaining that although the aggregate amount seemed hefty, it was divided among three distributors and spread over 18 years, and so would not have a big impact on his company.
Financial reports commissioned by cities and counties contend that the distributors could afford to pay between $ 35 billion and $ 50 billion over eight years.
At a recent closed-door session in federal court in Cleveland, where more than 3,500 opioid lawsuits have been consolidated, some states urged distributors to raise their offer by about $ 4 billion, according to lawyers who requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.
AmerisourceBergen declined to comment. Cardinal Health and McKesson each reiterated that they were committed to finding a global settlement structure that would ensure relief to stricken communities as swiftly as possible.
The issue of legal fees continues to be a source of considerable rancor. The states are represented in the litigation by public officials -- attorneys general, with salaried staff lawyers. Cities and counties are represented by private lawyers, who work on contingency fees.
And the appearance of possible conflicting interests raises eyebrows. Many states have also retained private counsel, some of whom simultaneously represent cities and counties. A few firms represent states that support the deal, as well as states and municipalities that oppose it.
Most states that oppose the deal happen to work with private counsel.
According to lawyers familiar with talks, some attorneys general want about $ 500 million from the $ 1.2 billion legal fund diverted to reimburse their staffs.
Lawyers for cities and counties have alternatively proposed establishing a fund of 7 percent of all settlement money, including any forthcoming from manufacturers and pharmacy chains that have also been sued.
The money, called a common benefit fund, would be allocated to lawyers according to a formula that would consider how much work their firms contributed to the litigation.
Some lawyers predict that amount could be as much as $ 3.3 billion, or even higher. Last month, 37 attorneys general signed a letter criticizing that amount, which, they said, siphoned off dollars that should go toward the public benefit.
The cities' and counties' distrust of the states dates back at least to the tobacco litigation in 1998, when funds from that settlement went into the coffers of state legislatures to address budget shortfalls instead of helping localities with smoking-related medical costs.

To Clean Up the Streets, City Proposes Taking In the Trash

Texto completo: City officials want additional storage inside buildings and attractive street-side bins.
They are piled all over New York -- unsightly monuments of trash blocking sidewalks and threatening pedestrian safety. For years, overstuffed garbage bags awaiting pickup have looked like an unavoidable fact of life.
Now, the city is rolling out two plans that officials hope will eliminate the problem.
The first would require new residential buildings of 300 units or more to store garbage and recycling indoors, where city sanitation trucks would then retrieve the bags. Many new buildings will have to create even more storage capacity than they need in case pickup is delayed.
The second initiative, which the city will begin this spring, would encourage businesses to put their garbage and recycling bags into sealed containers next to curbs, rather than directly on the sidewalk. The containers may take up to two parking spaces if placed on the street, said Dina Montes, a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation.
"We want to make sure that waste is not on the street," said Kathryn Garcia, the city's Department of Sanitation commissioner. Commercial trash in New York is generally collected by private carters, not the city.
The city has been considering these new initiatives for months but unveiled them as the coronavirus crisis has led to a shutdown of large gatherings in New York, and thousands of people have been staying at home to prevent the spread of the disease.
"We're trying to have creative solutions and to make it so that the city is a cleaner, safer place," Ms. Garcia said. "I think that everyone is very, very, very focused on cleanliness right this moment. As they should be."
Ms. Garcia said she anticipates some people will not be happy about the loss of public parking spaces. A public hearing on the proposals is scheduled for April 16.
Arthur Schwartz, a Greenwich Village resident and lawyer who has sued to stop a city plan that effectively banned private vehicles from a large section of 14th Street, agreed that it was paramount to solicit public comment.
Still, he said, he was amenable to the garbage bag plans, even if it will mean sacrificing parking spaces. "A spot or two on a block isn't going to change traffic dramatically," he said.
Improving waste removal efforts has vexed city officials for years. Despite a plethora of initiatives -- from increasing recycling efforts, introducing food waste removal and testing mint-scented garbage bags -- the piles of garbage bags have persisted.
For residents, the bags can be dangerous to navigate. For businesses open at night, the garbage mounds are uninviting obstacles standing between the storefronts and their customers.
The piles of trash bags also help feed New York's rat population. Rat sightings reported to the city's 311 hotline soared to 17,353 last year from 12,617 in 2014, according to an analysis of city data by OpenTheBooks.com, a nonprofit watchdog group, and The New York Times.
During that period, the number of times that city health inspections found active signs of rats nearly doubled. One way to cut down on the number of rats in the city is to bring garbage bags indoors, officials said.
Currently, the city picks up trash at about 330 buildings with garbage and recycling material stored in sealed containers, the department said. The benefits from this approach are numerous, Ms. Garcia said. "Pedestrians have a better experience, the waste is more constrained, and we're keeping the critters from any food that might be left on the curb."
Although it could take months for the plans to take effect, Ms. Garcia said she expects the results will be noticeable. "The experience for New York City residents, I think, will be a cleaner city," she said. "Particularly in Lower Manhattan, where you're in an old colonial city where it is a wall of waste on collection days."
Under one of the plans, the city's "Clean Curbs" pilot program, business improvement districts would apply to the city for permission to install sealed garbage containers. From there, private carting companies would retrieve the garbage and recycling.
Both of these possible changes would lead to a cleaner city and a perhaps a prettier sidewalk, Ms. Garcia said.
"We're trying to make it so that the containers that we end up approving are attractive in the public realm, so they don't necessarily look so much look like a garbage container," Ms. Garcia said, adding that designs for the bins include plants and other decorative elements.
In Chinatown, one of the city's most crowded and busy neighborhoods, Wellington Chen, the executive director of the business improvement district, said he welcomed the city's plans.
"There are many many reasons why the trash should be off the sidewalk," he said. For example, oil from garbage bags can leak onto the sidewalk and asphalt and form "pockets or ponds" that "hold stinking liquid down there," he said.
Closely monitoring the garbage pickup in his district has also helped Mr. Chen keep closer tabs on the pace of business, he said. "My garbage cans start to tell me, 'Hey there's a decline in visitors, watch out."'
He added: "The cans don't lie."

Halting China's economy was hard. Restarting it is harder.

Texto completo: SHANGHAI - China is starting to get back to work. More than six weeks after its leaders virtually shut down the world's second-largest economy to stop a relentless coronavirus outbreak, factories are reopening and offices are starting to fill.
That's little solace to Zhang Xu. Piles of windshields - some broken, others new and ready to be installed - sit untouched at his car repair shop in a blue-collar neighborhood in Shanghai. One of his two employees is still stuck in a faraway village. But that matters little, because Zhang has no customers.
"If we don't get sales, the distributor won't be able to order more from the factory and the factory won't be able to produce," Zhang said.
Stopping the Chinese industrial machine was painful for China and for the world - and restarting it may be even harder. Factories are well short of full capacity. Even the most successfully restarted cities are only halfway back. Tens of millions of laborers cannot get to work. Even when workers come back, Chinese businesses may find overseas demand slumping for their exports because of worsening coronavirus epidemics in other countries.
China's difficulties could hold lessons for other countries looking for answers to the outbreak. Looking for a way to slow the virus without sinking the economy, the United States on Wednesday blocked travelers from Europe, and President Donald Trump has said he wants to get consumers spending more. The Italian government imposed travel restrictions Monday on the entire country. Other places, like South Korea, have intensified testing and monitoring without trying to shut down their industrial engines.
Unquestionably, China has made progress starting up again. As supply chains in the West began to run dry, airfreight rates from China jumped suddenly last week, according to TAC Index, an air cargo pricing data company in Hong Kong.
"They need to be refilled now," said John Peyton Burnett, the company's managing director.
But factories in China are running at 50% to 60% of capacity, he said, and other measures show even less activity in many places.
Beijing has unleashed a series of measures to get offices and factories humming again. Bankers describe almost daily phone calls from regulators, telling them to show leniency on debt repayments, particularly from smaller businesses. Insurers have been told to extend policies even when premiums are not paid on time.
The state-owned railway has halved a wide range of freight charges. The national Education Ministry has created 180,000 spaces at graduate schools next autumn for students graduating this spring with little prospect of a job. Shanghai alone says it has helped residents and businesses with more than $15 billion in loans and other credit assistance, mainly from the state-controlled banking sector.
Those measures face formidable hurdles. Local officials are under pressure to reduce new infections, making them nervous about allowing people to return to work.
Cash-strapped families may also be reluctant to spend. Household and corporate debts are huge after a decade of heavy lending by the state-controlled banking sector. Workers do not know whether their employers can pay them. Businesses do not know if other businesses will default on payments for goods and services.
More than 50 million migrant workers have not yet returned to their jobs, according to official data. Some remain in quarantine. Others are stranded in rural areas where bus service has not resumed. Many are not yet needed by employers.
Factory owners face still one more problem: slowing global demand for the goods China makes. The coronavirus outbreak is threatening global growth, which could slow factories just as they restart. "If the demand shock is not addressed fast, then it could become a problem," said Cao Heping, a Peking University economist.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: Memo to Joe ...
Hey, things are going great. Take it easy.
Our former vice president is on a roll. A man who’d never won a primary before in three presidential campaigns pretty much swept the board on Super Tuesdays I & II. This was probably the best week of his entire political career.
Except maybe for the visit to an automobile plant in Detroit, where Biden called a union worker “full of ----” while shushing an aide who tried to get him to calm down.
It was during an argument over gun control. When his adversary said, “You’re working for me, man,” Biden swiftly retorted, “Don’t be such a horse’s ass.”
Several problems here, including the fact that when an, um, voter says, “You’re working for me,” the preferable response is: “Well, I certainly hope to be soon. You know, in the White House.”
One way or another, it was a bad moment. But hey, Biden is 77 and he’s been schlepping all over the country, giving speeches, eating bad food, shaking hands. (Don’t shake hands!) During his big, celebratory appearance after the primaries last week, his wife had to fight off a sign-wielding vegan who stormed the victory podium.
So the Detroit incident is hardly a moment that’s going to live on in history. We could forget about it instantly were it not a reminder that Biden is not great at spontaneous back-and-forth, like you get in ... a debate. One of which is scheduled for Sunday, when he meets Bernie Sanders one-on-one.
Even Sanders seems to hope his opponent doesn’t screw this one up. Bernie’s I’m-still-in-it announcement Wednesday did not contain a single negative word about Biden.
(On the other hand, within the first 50 seconds, he managed to call Donald Trump a “pathological liar” as well as “racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe and a religious bigot.” Kudos.)
Sanders began by acknowledging he’d had a bad night Tuesday, vote-wise. Indeed, any address in which a candidate’s most positive remark is “on the other hand, we won in North Dakota” could probably be described as bleak.
Sure, it’s unlikely that debate teams of the future are going to be studying Biden’s rhetoric. But we’re talking choices here. Who wouldn’t rather have a president with a habit of babbling than one who’d move into the Oval Office and start deconstructing the government’s pandemic control team?
Perhaps you remember a speech to college students Biden gave a couple of years back, in which he semi-ranted about Trump’s record on manhandling women — always a perfectly reasonable target.
But he then devolved into his dream of going back to high school to “beat the hell out” of the “guy who ended up becoming our national leader.”
It sorta went downhill from there, with Biden saying that his experience in locker rooms told him that a man who talked like Trump “was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room.”
I’m only recalling this since it gives me a chance to point out that after I wrote, rather disapprovingly, about that particular address, Biden called to thank me “for showing me what a jerk I was.”
Try to imagine Donald Trump doing something like that.

The RNC Gave Big Contracts to Companies Linked to Its Chairwoman’s Husband and Political Backers

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
The Republican National Committee has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to contractors closely connected to the organization’s chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel.
One contract went to her husband’s insurance company. Two others went to businesses whose executives recently donated to Ronna for Chair, a largely inactive political action committee that McDaniel controls. She had set it up in 2015, when she successfully ran for chair of the Republican Party in Michigan, her home state.
The companies won the contracts soon after McDaniel became the party’s top official. She was picked for the position by President Donald Trump after the 2016 election.
The RNC vendor payments and PAC contributions, detailed in federal tax filings and campaign finance reports, mirror a trend of transactions with favored contractors and employees previously reported by ProPublica.
The RNC conflict-of-interest policy states that employees “should avoid even the appearance of impropriety,” such as steering work to “members of an employee’s family” and businesses “with which the employee has a financial relationship.”
An RNC spokesman, Mike Reed, did not make McDaniel available for an interview. In a statement, he said ProPublica’s reporting was an attempt to make “innocuous RNC spending items seem scandalous,” and he accused ProPublica of harboring “a severe bias against conservatives and President Trump.”
Under McDaniel, the RNC is generating and disbursing record amounts, bringing in about $240 million last year and spending just over $190 million. And public scrutiny of its spending is increasing. ProPublica reported last month that in 2019 the RNC obscured payments to its chief of staff, who executes vendor contracts and is part of a tight network of operatives who have reaped financial rewards during the Trump era. This week, The New York Times reported that since 2017 the tiny circle, including a husband-and-wife duo of former RNC chiefs of staff and Trump’s campaign chairman, Brad Parscale, have billed the campaign, the RNC and other Republican groups some $75 million.
During McDaniel’s first year as chairwoman, the RNC hired a large, privately held insurance brokerage firm called Hylant to conduct an insurance review and liability assessment. Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show that the RNC specifically paid Hylant’s Detroit branch almost $40,000 for the company’s services.
The president of that particular office is Patrick McDaniel, the husband of the RNC’s chairwoman.
Reed, the party spokesman, told ProPublica that the Hylant contract “did not violate any RNC policy,” despite the organization’s written guidance about awarding business to members of an employee’s family. Reed said the RNC’s then-treasurer “solicited and signed off on” Hylant’s services. He did not not address who recommended Hylant or why the work was done out of the company’s Detroit office. Reed added that McDaniel’s husband “does not own this company and he received no financial benefit from this work.” Neither Hylant nor Patrick McDaniel returned messages seeking comment.
The two companies whose executives made contributions to McDaniel’s PAC had not received work from the RNC before she became chair.
Less than a week after McDaniel took over the party in January 2017, the RNC made its first monthly payment to the Templar Baker Group, a small political consulting outfit in Michigan headed by Robert Schostak, who chaired the Michigan Republican Party before McDaniel. Since she has been at the RNC, campaign finance reports show, Templar has been paid more than $550,000 for “political strategy services.”
Schostak is also a partner in MadDog Technology, a firm that is chaired by Peter Karmanos Jr., who helped found Compuware, once Michigan’s leading computer technology company. Last year, according to FEC filings, the RNC paid MadDog $50,000 for “website services.”

Dutton released a statement on Friday in which he described his situation.
"This morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat. I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for COVID-19. I was advised by Queensland this afternoon that the test had returned positive," Dutton said. "I feel fine and will provide an update in due course."

COVID-19 cases have appeared in every continent except Antarctica. Nearly 135,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 4,988 people, according to the New York Times. In the U.S., more than 1,600 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, and at least 40 patients have died. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic on Wednesday.

Will coronavirus bring the end of the Sanders campaign?

Texto completo: The Bernie Sanders campaign isn’t dead yet, but coronavirus disruptions are infecting it with life-threatening complications.
Much of the Vermont senator’s success has been credited with his large rallies and intimate meetings with voters. The global pandemic reshaping the world economy and basic social interactions has forced Sanders’s campaign to operate through less-effective phones and screens.
“In light of concerns about coronavirus and out of an abundance of caution for our staff, volunteers and supporters, the Sanders campaign has asked all staff to work from home and will no longer hold large events or door-to-door canvasses, instead moving to digital formats and outreach wherever possible,” said Sanders campaign communications manager Mike Casca on Thursday.
The announcement came after Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden each canceled campaign rallies in Ohio hours before their scheduled start times on Tuesday following the state of emergency declared by the governor. One of his directives was discouraging large gatherings.
"Bernie is the better rally speaker," said Democratic strategist Steve Rabinowitz, a Biden supporter and former Clinton White House aide who designed and produced the president's public events. "It is a disadvantage for him. If he could keep doing these big rallies, they work better for him."
Those changes largely undermine one of Sanders’s principal electoral arguments: that only his campaign generates the necessary enthusiasm to drive voter turnout in November. Studies also find that door-to-door canvassing, another key strength of Sanders’s campaign operation, is the most effective and efficient way to turn out voters for a candidate.
Wall-to-wall news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic already makes it more difficult for a candidate to get his message out.
As the coronavirus complicates operations, the biggest problem is that the Sanders campaign has an underlying condition: He keeps losing primaries.
Sanders, who often has to explain why his controversial “Medicare for all” proposal that outlaws private insurance in favor of a single-payer system is superior to Biden’s, is already at a disadvantage of winning new voters over because of poor performance in recent primaries.
Biden has a lead of about 156 pledged delegates over Sanders and needs 1,110 more in order to secure the Democratic presidential nomination. The next major primary states — Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia — favor Biden, and Sanders has little chance of closing that gap.
A New York Times analysis found that Sanders would have to perform 21 percentage points better to take a delegate lead over Biden and 12 percentage points better to keep Biden from earning a majority of pledged delegates, forcing a contested convention.
"With all due respect to Sen. Sanders, his problem is he's losing, not that he's losing to coronavirus," Rabinowitz said.
But some say Sanders still has a chance, no matter how small.
“He has a very effective other means of communicating, and so do his leading surrogates and his supporters,” said independent pollster John Zogby. “He has the capacity to use social media to a large degree.”
Rabinowitz noted that Sanders could keep supporters engaged by livestreaming small events.
"If I was trying to help, I would say go fly to the coming primary states and visit with just a handful of people who are comfortable seeing you in an old-fashioned parlor meeting," Rabinowitz said, "and stream the meeting."
The Vermont senator, though, is returning to the Senate next week rather than spending his days campaigning — unlike Biden, who replaced in-person campaign events with "virtual" town halls in Illinois and Florida.
Sanders is widely thought to be waging a campaign about the future of the Democratic Party rather than trying to win the nomination. Any setbacks are unlikely to push him to the point of dropping out.
“He's in it for the long haul. The debate over the heart and soul of the party,” Zogby said. “It makes sense for him to go to Milwaukee with as many delegates as he can.”
Zogby mentioned the 1980 Democratic presidential primary when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts challenged President Jimmy Carter from the left. While Kennedy did not defeat Carter, after early defeats, he got a surge in momentum and won some later states in the primary.
And national focus on health measures gives Sanders an opportunity to rally support for his own agenda.
“He may get a boost on 'Medicare for all,'” Zogby said, referring to the Vermont senator’s single-payer healthcare plan that would eliminate private insurance. Voters may believe that “drastic times call for drastic measures.”
Some of his die-hard supporters are remaining positive, saying Sanders’s existing campaign infrastructure allows his staff to work remotely.
“Cancelling upcoming campaign rallies doesn’t mean that communication with supporters, get out the vote efforts, or Sanders campaign fund-raising will necessarily be hampered. Sanders has been very adept, in the past, at holding 'town hall' meetings, via telephone conference calls, with large numbers of activists at the same time,” said Steve Early, who co-founded the group “Labor for Bernie.” “In 2016, and before recent primaries, campaign volunteers and staff have maintained contact with thousands of likely voters via texting and phone calling.”

Trump is right: Suspend the payroll tax

Texto completo: With the stock market reeling, supply chains disrupted, and consumers engaging in “social distancing” because of the coronavirus outbreak, the economy will slow significantly in the coming months.
Of course, stopping the spread of virus is the key to turning the economic corner. But no one knows for sure when that will happen. In the meantime, Washington must support consumers and businesses, especially smaller businesses, by lowering one of the most oppressive of all federal taxes — the payroll tax.
President Trump has called for a 0% payroll tax from now until the end of the year to boost the economy, but Congress seems to be waffling. A reduction to 0% would immediately increase take-home pay for millions of workers, shrink the cost of labor for businesses, and provide insurance against a downturn.
The payroll tax is imposed on both employees and employers to fund Social Security, Medicare, and other social-insurance programs. Since 1955, the basic payroll tax rate has nearly quadrupled from 4% to 15.3%. Today, almost 70% of taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than they do in federal income taxes. Altogether, the typical worker pays nearly twice as much in payroll taxes as in income taxes.
The payroll tax continues to impose a heavy economic burden on workers and small businesses. The maximum Social Security payroll tax for a single-earner family is now a whopping $7,960 annually. Moreover, payroll taxes are highly regressive, with the bottom fifth of households paying 6.9% on average while the top 1% pay 2.3%, according to the Tax Policy Center.
Suspending the Social Security payroll tax from April 1, 2020 through the end of the year would immediately support after-tax incomes for workers and cash flow for businesses, providing a much-needed boost to the employees and owners of the small businesses and industries most acutely impacted by the virus.
Although a payroll tax cut wouldn’t solve the myriad issues caused by the coronavirus, the effects at the margin would encourage workers to seek more hours and induce businesses to hire more workers.
Many high-income workers have already paid their full year’s-worth of Social Security taxes by this time of year, so any cut would provide extra benefit to the middle and working classes. And, unlike other suggestions to boost government spending, the money would not be delayed by bureaucratic planning (like infrastructure projects) or flow-through rent-seeking special interests (industry-specific bailouts); it would instead go directly to workers and businesses.
Trump’s proposal would amount to a huge $800 billion tax cut or 5% of gross domestic product over nine months. The evidence from President Barack Obama’s payroll tax cut in 2011 found that people spent 35% of each dollar in tax relief. Therefore, a 0% payroll tax rate would boost the economy by $30 billion a month or 1.7 percentage points in Gross Domestic Product over the nine-month timeframe.
While a payroll-tax cut would temporarily enlarge the budget deficit, it would be wise to weigh this against the more damaging costs of a deep recession. Regarding potential concerns about the impact on the Social Security Trust Fund, such a temporary reduction is unlikely to have significant lasting impact.
A payroll tax cut should not be a partisan issue. President Obama supported a temporary payroll tax reduction during his first term. In 1990, my then-boss Senator Robert Kasten Jr., R-Wisc., teamed up with Senator Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., on payroll-tax-cut legislation that garnered the support of the National Federation of Independent Businesses and the AFL-CIO.
Tax cuts are the most efficient stimulus for the economy, and action needs to happen quickly. Congress should take up President Trump’s proposal immediately to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus for hourly workers.

Anthony Fauci: Coronavirus crisis could worsen over next 'eight weeks or more'

Texto completo: White House coronavirus task force expert Anthony Fauci said the pandemic will "get worse before it gets better" over the next eight weeks.
As universities are closing, professional sporting events are canceled, and a growing number of the public are working remotely due to the novel coronavirus, Fauci was asked on ABC's Good Morning America if the state of the country will worsen or improve with time.
"Well, it's certainly going to get worse before it gets better," Fauci said of the spreading virus.
"If you look the pattern of viruses, particularly these types of viruses, and even look at what has gone on in China, Italy, and in South Korea, you go along like this, the way we were. And then you have a big spike that goes way up. And then after a while, after much disease, suffering, and death, it goes back down again," he continued while speaking on measures to mitigate COVID-19's infection rates.
"But to be clear, we have not peaked yet?" Fauci was asked. "No, there's no doubt that we have not peaked yet," he replied.
Fauci was then asked if it was possible for the United States to issue a complete lockdown of foreign travel, to which Fauci said: "all things are on the table."
“I'm not sure we're going to get to that. I think that would be really rather dramatic, but I can tell you that all things are on the table. We just have to respond as things evolve over the days and over the weeks.”
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the public should expect destabilization of their normal routine for the next several months, estimating the situation could worsen up to "eight weeks or more."
“I mean it’s unpredictable, but if you look at historically, how these things work, it'll likely be anywhere from a few weeks up to eight weeks or more,” he said while adding that he hopes it'll end before then. “But It’s really impossible to make an accurate prediction."
COVID-19 cases have appeared in every continent except Antarctica. Nearly 135,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 4,988 people, according to the New York Times. In the U.S., more than 1,600 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and at least 40 patients have died. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic on Wednesday.

Texto completo: President Trump said Friday he "most likely" will be tested for the coronavirus after coming into close contact with a member of the Brazilian president's delegation over the weekend who later tested positive for COVID-19.
After declaring a national emergency in the White House Rose Garden to combat the pandemic, Trump was asked by a reporter if it was "selfish" not to be tested for the coronavirus, potentially putting others at the risk of infection.
"I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested," he said, contradicting an answer he gave another reporter only moments earlier.
"Are you going to be?" a reporter asked.
"Most likely, yeah. Most likely. Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway," the president said.
Asked when the test would happen, Trump said, "Fairly soon. We're working out a schedule."

Minutes earlier, Trump maintained there was no reason to be tested for the virus.
"No, we have no symptoms whatsoever," Trump said. "We had a great meeting with the president of Brazil, Bolsonaro. Great guy, very tremendous. He's doing a fantastic job for Brazil," he said. "And, as you know, he tested negative, meaning nothing wrong, this morning. And we got that word, too."

During a Friday interview before Trump's announcement, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he recommended a coronavirus test for anybody who had similar interactions experienced by Trump.
"Generally speaking, if I were standing next to someone who had been diagnosed with coronavirus, should I isolate myself and find a test as well?” asked MSNBC host Willie Geist. "Yes," Fauci said.
“OK, so that goes for the president, likely, in theory, at least, but you’ll leave it to his doctor?” Geist asked Fauci.
“I’m going to leave it to his physician, who’s a very good physician,” Fauci added.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Thursday that neither Trump nor Vice President Mike Pence would "require" testing for COVID-19 after meeting with the Brazilian delegation at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
In making her case, Grisham said the president did not have an extended interaction with Brazilian press secretary Fabio Wajngarten, who tested positive for the illness.
“The White House is aware of public reports that a member of the Brazilian delegation‘s visit to Mar-a-Lago last weekend tested positive for COVID-19; confirmatory testing is pending. Exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps," Grisham said. "Both the president and vice president had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time."
Both Wajngarten and Bolsonaro attended a dinner with Trump and Pence at the resort in South Florida, taking several photographs with them. Reports on Friday said Bolsonaro tested positive for the virus, but the Brazilian president, along with his son Eduardo Bolsonaro, denied the "fake news" reports and said he tested negative.
"Too much lies and little information. Coronavirus exam done with the team that were with JB in USA have not yet been completed There are always those people who tell lies in the media and if the story is confirmed they say 'I told you!', if not will be just 1 more fake news," Bolsonaro's son said in a series of tweets.
Other administration officials, including first daughter Ivanka Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, have also been exposed to people who tested positive for the coronavirus. Peter Dutton, the Australian minister for foreign affairs, interacted with them at a gathering last week in D.C.
CNN's Kaitlan Collins reported on Friday that Ivanka Trump had "worked from home" though did not require testing because she did not exhibit any symptoms.
COVID-19 cases have appeared in every continent except Antarctica. Nearly 135,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 4,988 people, according to the New York Times. In Italy, there have been approximately 15,113 confirmed cases and 1,016 deaths. The country has closed all businesses, with the exception of grocery stores, banks, and pharmacies, and has placed the entire nation on lockdown.

Texto completo: As the coronavirus spreads, many are beginning to question the federal government’s ability to contain and mitigate this crisis. One group, however, remains confident that the government could do more if given the chance.

That group is led by none other than Bernie Sanders, an out-and-proud socialist who is using the coronavirus outbreak to push for a single-payer healthcare system. COVID-19 and the current testing shortage, he improbably argues, is actually proof that the United States would be better served by a nationalized bureaucratic healthcare system. “It has never been more important to finally guarantee healthcare as a human right by passing Medicare for All,” he said in a Feb. 27 statement.

Sanders isn’t the only one, either. Sen. Ed Markey issued a similar statement on Friday afternoon, and he was joined by several other Democrats.TweetOne glance at how this virus has affected the rest of the world, however, quickly dispels this idea. Italy, which has a single-payer healthcare system, has seen its hospitals overwhelmed. Hundreds of elderly citizens are going without treatment. Hundreds more have died already. Its system was woefully unprepared for this pandemic, and, as a result, the country has been unable to react to COVID-19's effects in a timely fashion. The result has been disastrous.

In Britain, ventilators are in vastly short supply. Intensive care beds have already been filled, and doctors are beginning to tire, one physician told the New York Times. The British socialized healthcare system, which American socialists often tout as a base model, has been incapable of handling this outbreak, even though the United Kingdom has been dealing with far fewer cases than other parts of the world.

The U.S. government can and should do more to help the public prepare for coronavirus’s continued spread. Already, the Trump administration has adopted a hands-on approach, working with health insurance companies to wave co-pays, partnering with Congress to provide two weeks of paid sick leave, and providing additional funding for small businesses as economic activity slows.

The greatest amount of relief, however, has not come from the federal government but from the private sector. At least two vaccines have been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval, and several private health companies, such as the Michigan-based NeuMoDx, have rolled out technology that can be adapted and used to test for the coronavirus. All of this happened within a matter of weeks.
"You have to embrace the private sector," Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a press conference Friday afternoon. "You can't do it without it."

Compare this to the federal government’s response, which has been lethargic at best and negligent at worst. We’ve known about this virus for months, yet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s early screening process was “slow” and full of “missteps,” as Fauci has readily admitted. Even now, testing is severely limited in even the states that have done the most to expand it.
The simple truth is that government is not very good at handling fast-paced, widespread problems. There is too much red tape, too much politicking, and too much fighting over territory. Just consider Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose unprofessional and partisan behavior is the norm in government. Rather than work constructively with the Trump administration on a bipartisan solution to a real-world problem, he went straight to blame-casting and name-calling the moment the first stateside infections reached his state.
Despite all this, Sanders and the other socialists would have us believe that the solution is more government intervention, more politicians and their egos, and more bureaucratic regulation.

This is nonsense. We have the “best public health system in the world,” as former FDA Director Scott Gottlieb said last month. It is equipped with “the best infection control procedures, well-equipped hospitals, and skilled providers,” he explained. If any country can beat the coronavirus and come out on top, it will be the U.S. And we will have the free market to thank.

Western media parroting Chinese Communist Party propaganda

Texto completo: China is engaged in a wide-scale propaganda effort to convince the world that it is not responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, portraying itself with carefully distributed disinformation as being the most proactive, intelligent, and responsible of the world superpowers.

And many in America's free press are happy to help China gaslight the entire world.

“China Bought the West Time. The West Squandered It,” reads the headline to an opinion article published Friday by the New York Times.

Earlier, on Thursday, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow hosted reporter Donald McNeil, who explained that China has had “enormous success in beating down its epidemic” because of its advancements in healthcare technology, testing, and mandatory quarantines.
Maddow thanked McNeil at the end of the segment for explaining so convincingly the “distance between” what China has done to fight COVID-19 and “what we’re preparing for.” Later, on social media, the Maddow show shared a clip of the segment with the headline “How coronavirus testing works in a country that takes the problem seriously.”

Elsewhere this week, the Atlantic’s Anne Applebaum asked on social media, “China has reacted to the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy by sending aid. The U.S. has reacted by suspending flights. Who is the superpower?”

Let’s get the facts straight.

COVID-19 has spread to more than 120 countries, claiming more than 5,000 lives, precisely because of the Chinese government’s arrogance and incompetence.
Chinese authorities knew about the virus in December of last year when it first appeared in the city of Wuhan. Instead of taking cautious measures and sharing what they knew about the disease with the rest of the world, China’s government engaged in a massive cover-up, hoping that maybe it would all just go away.
The Chinese government suppressed the sharing of relevant information, arresting and punishing medical professionals who tried to warn people that there was something going around with SARS-like symptoms.
Chinese President Xi Jinping later had the gall to criticize the U.S. government after it imposed a temporary (and apparently prescient) travel ban on Chinese visitors. Xi seems to think that China can fool the world, and, based on the way Western journalists are reacting, he might be right.

“This isn’t blanket praise for an authoritarian party-state,” Guardian columnist Bhaskar Sunkara said Thursday, “but thank God this pandemic started in a country with a strong state that took serious public health measures. Imagine if China was run by the GOP instead of the CCP.”
Sorry, but that is exactly blanket praise for an authoritarian party-state. It's also a complete denial of reality. If this virus had emerged in the United States, it would have been reported on and taken seriously. Too bad it emerged in a country run by a secretive, authoritarian dictatorship.

“How uncomfortable is it,” asked MSNBC’s Chuck Todd this weekend, “that perhaps China’s authoritarian ways did prevent this? Meaning, had China been a free and open society, this might have spread faster?”

No, Chuck. China did not “prevent” anything. Ask the Italians.
Finally, the viral clip of McNeil’s appearance this week on MSNBC, the one that supposedly shows China actually takes the virus “seriously," includes no mentions whatsoever of the Chinese government’s effort to suppress information or punish whistleblowers.
The truth is that China did absolutely everything wrong. One can only wonder what is motivating the Western journalists who pretend the contrary is true.

Paul Krugman: It’s a MAGA microbe meltdown

Texto completo: For three years, Donald Trump led a charmed life. He faced only one major crisis that he didn’t generate himself — Hurricane Maria — and although his botched response contributed to a tragedy that killed thousands of U.S. citizens, the deaths took place off camera, allowing him to deny that anything bad had happened.
Now, however, we face a much bigger crisis with the coronavirus. And Trump’s response has been worse than even his harshest critics could have imagined. He has treated a dire threat as a public relations problem, combining denial with frantic blame-shifting.
His administration has failed to deliver the most basic prerequisite of pandemic response, widespread testing to track the disease’s spread. He has failed to implement recommendations of public health experts, instead imposing pointless travel bans on foreigners when all indications are that the disease is already well established in the United States.
And his response to the economic fallout has veered between complacency and hysteria, with a strong admixture of cronyism.
It’s something of a mystery why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, normally a highly competent agency, has utterly failed to provide resources for widespread coronavirus testing during the pandemic’s crucial early stages. But it’s hard to avoid the suspicion that the incompetence is related to politics, perhaps to Trump’s desire to play down the threat.
According to Reuters, the Trump administration has ordered health agencies to treat all coronavirus deliberations as classified. This makes no sense and is indeed destructive in terms of public policy, but it makes perfect sense if the administration doesn’t want the public to know how its actions are endangering American lives.
In any case, it’s clear what we should be doing now that there must already be thousands of cases all across the United States. We need to slow the disease’s spread by creating “social distance” — banning large gatherings, encouraging those who can to work from home — and quarantining hot spots. This may or may not be enough to prevent tens of millions from getting sick, but even spreading out the pandemic over time would help prevent it from overloading the health care system, greatly reducing the number of deaths.
But there was almost none of this in Trump’s speech; he’s still acting as if this is a threat foreigners are bringing to America.
And when it comes to the economy, Trump seems to fluctuate day to day — even hour to hour — between assertions that everything is fine and demands for enormous, ill-conceived stimulus.
His big idea for the economy is a complete payroll tax holiday. According to Bloomberg News, he told Republican senators that he wanted the holiday to extend “through the November election so that taxes don’t go back up before voters decide whether to return him to office.” That is, he apparently said the quiet part out loud.
This would be an enormous move. Payroll taxes are 5.9% of GDP; by comparison, the Obama stimulus of 2009-2010 peaked at about 2.5% of GDP. Yet it would be very poorly targeted: big breaks for well-paid workers, nothing for the unemployed or those without paid sick leave.
Why do it this way? After all, if the goal is to put money in people’s hands, why not just send out checks? Apparently Republicans can’t conceive of an economic policy that doesn’t take the form of tax cuts.
Trump also reportedly wants to provide aid to specific industries, including oil and shale — a continuation of his administration’s efforts to subsidize fossil fuels.
Democrats, by contrast, have proposed a package that would actually address the needs of the moment: free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, expanded unemployment benefits and an increase in federal matching funds for Medicaid programs, which would both help states meet the demands of the crisis and sustain overall spending by relieving the pressure on state budgets.
Notice, by the way, that these measures would help the economy in an election year and therefore arguably help Trump politically. But Democrats are willing to do the right thing anyway — a stark contrast to the behavior of Republicans after the 2008 financial crisis, when they offered scorched-earth opposition to anything that might mitigate the damage.
The White House, however, is having none of it, with an official accusing Democrats of pushing a “radical left agenda.” I guess sick leave equals socialism, even in a pandemic.
So what’s going on? What we’re seeing here is a meltdown — not just a meltdown of the markets but a meltdown of Trump’s mind. When bad things happen, there are only three things he knows how to do: insist that things are great and his policies are perfect, cut taxes, and throw money at his cronies.
Now he’s faced with a crisis where none of these standbys will work, where he actually needs to cooperate with Nancy Pelosi to avoid catastrophe. What we saw in Wednesday’s speech was that he’s completely incapable of rising to the occasion. We needed to see a leader; what we saw was an incompetent, delusional blowhard.

David Brooks: Pandemics kill human compassion, too

Texto completo: Some disasters, like hurricanes and earthquakes, can bring people together, but if history is any judge, pandemics generally drive them apart. These are crises in which social distancing is a virtue. Dread overwhelms the normal bonds of human affection.
In “The Decameron,” Giovanni Boccaccio writes about what happened during the plague that hit Florence in 1348: “Tedious were it to recount how citizen avoided citizen, how among neighbors was scarce found any that shewed fellow-feeling for another, how kinfolk held aloof, and never met … nay, what is more, and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to abandon their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate.”
In his book on the 1665 London epidemic, “A Journal of the Plague Year,” Daniel Defoe reports, “This was a time when every one’s private safety lay so near them they had no room to pity the distresses of others. … The danger of immediate death to ourselves, took away all bonds of love, all concern for one another.”
Fear drives people in these moments, but so does shame, caused by the brutal things that have to be done to slow the spread of the disease. In all pandemics people are forced to make the decisions that doctors in Italy are now forced to make — withholding care from some of those who are suffering and leaving them to their fate.
In 17th-century Venice, health workers searched the city, identified plague victims and shipped them off to isolated “hospitals,” where two-thirds of them died. In many cities over the centuries, municipal authorities locked whole families in their homes, sealed the premises and blocked any delivery of provisions or medical care.
Frank Snowden, the Yale historian who wrote “Epidemics and Society,” argues that pandemics hold up a mirror to society and force us to ask basic questions: What is possible imminent death trying to tell us? Where is God in all this? What’s our responsibility to one another?
Pandemics induce a feeling of enervating fatalism. People realize how little they control their lives. Anton Chekhov was a victim during a TB epidemic that traveled across Russia in the late 19th century. Snowden points out that the plays he wrote during his recovery are about people who feel trapped, waiting for events outside their control, unable to act, unable to decide.
Pandemics also hit the poor hardest and inflame class divisions.
Cholera struck Naples in 1884, especially the Lower City, where the poor lived. Rumors swept the neighborhood that city officials were deliberately spreading the disease. When highhanded public health workers poured into Lower City, the locals revolted, throwing furniture at them, hurling them down stairs.
The city thought the disease was passed on by people eating unripe or overripe fruit. The peasants responded by bringing baskets of fruit to City Hall and gorging on it in public — a way to hold up a defiant middle finger against the elites who were so useless in the face of the disease.
The Spanish flu pandemic that battered America in 1918 produced similar reactions. John M. Barry, author of “The Great Influenza,” reports that as conditions worsened, health workers in city after city pleaded for volunteers to care for the sick. Few stepped forward.
In Philadelphia, the head of emergency aid pleaded for help in taking care of sick children. Nobody answered. The organization’s director turned scornful: “Hundreds of women … had delightful dreams of themselves in the roles of angels of mercy. … Nothing seems to rouse them now. … There are families in which every member is ill, in which the children are actually starving because there is no one to give them food. The death rate is so high, and they still hold back.”
This explains one of the puzzling features of the 1918 pandemic. When it was over, people didn’t talk about it. There were very few books or plays written about it. Roughly 675,000 Americans lost their lives to the flu, compared with 53,000 in battle in World War I, and yet it left almost no conscious cultural mark.
Perhaps it’s because people didn’t like who they had become. It was a shameful memory and therefore suppressed. In her 1976 dissertation, “A Cruel Wind,” Dorothy Ann Pettit argues that the 1918 flu pandemic contributed to a kind of spiritual torpor afterward. People emerged from it physically and spiritually fatigued. The flu, Pettit writes, had a sobering and disillusioning effect on the national spirit.
There is one exception to this sad litany: health care workers. In every pandemic there are doctors and nurses who respond with unbelievable heroism and compassion. That’s happening today.
Mike Baker recently had a report in The New York Times about the EvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland, Washington, where the staff showed the kind of effective compassion that has been evident in all pandemics down the centuries. “We have not had issues with staff not wanting to come in,” an Evergreen executive said. “We’ve had staff calling and say, ‘If you need me, I’m available.”
Maybe this time we’ll learn from their example. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to take steps to fight the moral disease that accompanies the physical one.

Texto completo: Washington • The Trump administration Monday night issued several pages of tips for navigating the coronavirus, organizing a set of recommendations for schools, businesses, homes and offices into a document that resembles easy-on-the-eye restaurant food-safety charts.
The simple behaviors recommended in the guidelines — like washing hands, managing air flow, protecting food and carving out private space in a home — show how federal health officials believe the virus could influence everyday life.
“These are really simple, low-tech things,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, said at a White House news briefing. “There’s nothing in there that’s complicated. But it’s just stated in a way that’s clear, that people can understand.”
After the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence posted images of the guidelines on Twitter. They are expected to also be published on Coronavirus.gov, a federal hub of virus information where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already posted similar advice.
Here is what the guidelines recommend.
How to navigate the office
Stay home if you or family members who live with you are sick. Several top health officials have repeatedly urged Americans to not risk going to work if they come down with symptoms that might indicate an infection.
Use the usual electronic means of work life, like email, to remind yourself to wash your hands. Devise ways to remember to not touch your face. And avoid shaking hands — “noncontact methods of greeting” are preferable.

Instead of in-person meetings, the guidelines suggest teleconferencing. If meetings are held in person, they should be in open, well-ventilated rooms. Open windows will help.
The World Health Organization warns that “poorly ventilated buildings affect air quality and can contribute to the spread of disease,” and that in health facilities with a high concentration of infectious patients, poor ventilation worsens the risk of transmission.
How to divide a home
Divvy up your home to account for the elderly or those with underlying conditions that make them particularly susceptible to infection. Make a “protected space” for those at risk, and give the sick their own rooms, where the door should be kept closed. Only one person should care for the ill.
Healthy people in your home should act as if they could be a risk to the vulnerable, washing their hands frequently before interacting with them.
How to keep a school safe
Schools should avoid mixing ages and consider adjusting or postponing in-school and extracurricular gatherings that intermingle classes and grades. Classes should be held outdoors, if possible, or anywhere well ventilated.
Students should limit sharing food, and cafeteria workers should practice strict hygiene. Schools should screen cafeteria workers and those they come in contact with.
How to protect a business
Businesses should limit attendance at large gatherings and use online transactions for events, avoiding the kind of close contact that occurs at box offices. The advice follows news of several large event cancellations, including the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, a major professional tennis tournament in California and a health conference where President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak.
Businesses should promote “tap and pay” machines that cut down on the use of cash, a notorious germ-carrying material.
Drivers for ride-sharing services and taxis should keep their windows open and regularly disinfect surfaces. Uber has said it will offer drivers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are infected with the coronavirus or are quarantined.

COVID-19 DISRUPTS TRAVEL INTERNATIONAL TRIPS NIXED AS VIRUS SPREADS, ITALY PRACTICALLY SHUTS DOWN

Texto completo: The COVID-19 travel time bomb just blew up. A week ago, people were optimistic but still planning to travel. This week, more travelers are changing their plans.
Take Tim McVay and David Bush, of Shadyside. They had planned a trip to the Chianti region of Italy.
"Our friends from Norway had invited us to spend a week later in April in Tuscany with them in a lovely villa," Mr. Bush said.
They had rented a place on a vineyard but began to have concerns as the news changed.
"We delayed our decision until [Tuesday] morning because our hesitation was less about getting sick and more about being quarantined," Mr. Bush said.
They've canceled, joining the growing numbers of people choosing to stay home.
Travel adviser Christina O'Toole, with Avenue Two Travel in Sewickley, said the situation in the popular European destination caught a lot of would-be travelers' attention.
"A week ago, people became cautious with the news out of Italy," Ms. O'Toole said.
"Travelers wanted to know their options before they decided to cancel or postpone their trip," she added.
With problems on cruise ships, concerns about flights and travel rules changing - along with serious moves like all of Italy going into quarantine - options started to shrink.
The good news, Ms. O'Toole noted, is that the travel industry is trying to accommodate its patrons.
"This week, tour operators, cruise lines and airlines have adjusted their cancellation and change fees, and airlines are waiving change fees," she said, adding that cruise lines like Silversea allow cancellations with a full refund 30 days from the sailing date.
The changes are giving travelers and organizations time to make an educated decision.
The Carnegie Museums Travel Program has decided to cancel all of its planned trips through April.
"Our travelers are the most important part of our program," said Barbara Tucker, the director of the museums' travel program. The Carnegie takes groups of eight to as many as 18 depending on the trip.
"We will continue to evaluate the situation and are refunding our travelers," she added. "I have never seen anything like this in my 19 years with the Carnegie - it is unprecedented."
Talk to anyone who had travel plans - especially international plans - and they are either reconsidering, canceling or delaying, especially in light of the president's latest travel ban.
"We were planning on flying to Frankfurt, Germany, to eventually get to Strasbourg, France, and Baden-Baden, Germany," Michael Danek said.
He and his wife, Heather, both of the South Hills, are avid travelers and had planned this trip in October. Concerned about the current hyper-vigilance because of COVID-19, he contacted the local tourist board in Stuttgart, Germany, to see what they were doing.
"I received a couple of very professional emails, and I was satisfied with their precautions," he noted.
His wife works for the University of Pittsburgh, however, and the university asked faculty and students not to travel to France, Italy or Germany over spring break. That was the tipping point for the Daneks to start to change their travel plans.
"Delta had a couple of websites that explained the rules to rebook without a fee," he said. "They were pretty flexible, but the websites had a bunch of dead links and there was a 7.5-hour wait on the phone."
"This is exactly why you work with a trusted travel adviser," insisted Ms. O'Toole. "As travel advisers, we have been through it all - 9/11, SARS, Ebola, volcanic eruptions - and our main concern is always the health and safety of our clients."
The Daneks were not able to rebook to Frankfurt because of fine print requiring the same fare class to be available.
But Mr. Danek was able to take care of the rebooking via direct messages on Twitter with Delta customer service.
"Instead of 7.5 hours, it took 40 minutes beginning to end," he recalled. Their new plans will take them from Poland to London in May.
Mr. McVay and Mr. Bush may have canceled their visit to Italy, but they are still hoping to attend a wedding in Wiltshire, England, this summer.
"Hopefully, the situation will have been resolved," Mr. Bush said.
"If we cannot attend, you might get sick of seeing us in our new morning suits," he joked.

Texto completo: Imágenes de satélite muestran que Irán ha excavado enormes fosas comunes en medio del nuevo brote de coronavirus , que ha golpeado con fuerza al país. Las fotografías de las excavaciones se tomaron en un cementerio ubicado al norte de la ciudad sagrada del país.
The New York Times, que publicó las fotos, apuntó que las dos largas trincheras de una longitud total de 100 yardas se cavarían a finales de febrero. Por su parte, el británico The Guardian habla de temores ante el alcance de la pandemia en Irán y de un posible encubrimiento del gobierno.
Un legislador de Qom, donde se realizaron las excavaciones, acusó al ministerio de salud de mentir sobre la magnitud del brote . Según él, en la ciudad -ubicada a 75 millas al sur de Teherán- había habido 50 muertos y que la institución solo había confirmado 12 en todo el país.
El viceministro de Salud, Iraj Harirchi, “negó categóricamente” las “afirmaciones” pero, mientras lo hacía, estaba claramente sudando y tosiendo. Un día después, el propio Harirchi dio positivo por COVID-19.
Las últimas cifras del ministerio iraní hablan de más de 10,000 infectados en el país y 429 muertos.
Fue Amir Afkhami, que ha escrito sobre la experiencia de Irán en la epidemia del cólera, quien sugirió que las fosas comunes hacen aumentar las sospechas del encubrimiento gubernamental de una mayor mortalidad por coronavirus.
“No me sorprende que ahora estén tratando de crear fosas comunes y tratando de ocultar el alcance real del impacto de la enfermedad”, dijo Afkhami, que esta también profesor asociado de la Universidad George Washington. El profesor también apuntó a la rápida asociación comercial entre Irán y China como un factor clave para la rápida propagación de la enfermedad.

Un legislador de Qom, donde se realizaron las excavaciones, acusó al ministerio de salud de mentir sobre la magnitud del brote . Según él, en la ciudad -ubicada a 75 millas al sur de Teherán- había habido 50 muertos y que la institución solo había confirmado 12 en todo el país.
El viceministro de Salud, Iraj Harirchi, “negó categóricamente” las “afirmaciones” pero, mientras lo hacía, estaba claramente sudando y tosiendo. Un día después, el propio Harirchi dio positivo por COVID-19.
Las últimas cifras del ministerio iraní hablan de más de 10,000 infectados en el país y 429 muertos.
Fue Amir Afkhami, que ha escrito sobre la experiencia de Irán en la epidemia del cólera, quien sugirió que las fosas comunes hacen aumentar las sospechas del encubrimiento gubernamental de una mayor mortalidad por coronavirus.
“No me sorprende que ahora estén tratando de crear fosas comunes y tratando de ocultar el alcance real del impacto de la enfermedad”, dijo Afkhami, que esta también profesor asociado de la Universidad George Washington. El profesor también apuntó a la rápida asociación comercial entre Irán y China como un factor clave para la rápida propagación de la enfermedad.

NFL cancels pre-draft travel; hasn't made call on draft as coronavirus outbreak causes shutdown

Texto completo: The NFL has not yet decided whether to move forward as planned with the NFL Draft, which is set to be held April 23-25 in Last Vegas. But on Friday the league office sent a memo to all 32 teams advising them that all pre-draft travel has been canceled, and that teams or individuals will be punished for violating the rules.
This means that teams will no longer be able to host 30 draft prospects on official visits to the team facilities. Team personnel are also not allowed to travel to any location, including universities, to speak with prospects.
Instead, the NFL will allow teams to schedule up to three phone or video calls with draft prospects per week, with a maximum length of one hour. The calls cannot interfere with a prospect's school schedule.
“Any club personnel who violate any of the above restrictions will be subject to League discipline," the memo stated.
The official visits are an important part of the pre-draft process. The day-long visits allow the teams to get to know the player on a personnel level, to dig deeper on any prospects with red flags, and to let their medical staff take a closer look at the players.
The pre-draft visits usually begin around April 1. But the Miami Dolphins, perhaps anticipating that the NFL could shut down pre-draft travel, managed to sneak Ohio State running back J.K. Dobbins and Utah quarterback Jordan Love in for official visits on Thursday and Friday, before the NFL banned all travel.
The league will also work with its competition committee and organizers of the NFL Combine to collect and disseminate medical information of draft prospects.
“We have not taken this step lightly but believe that it is most consistent with protecting the health of our club personnel, draft eligible players, and the public," the memo stated. “It also has the ancillary benefit of ensuring competitive equity."
On Thursday the NFL canceled two local combines scheduled for later this month, and its annual owners meetings, which were set for March 29-April 1 in Palm Beach, Fla. The NFL has not yet changed the schedule for the start of free agency and the new league year, which is currently set for Wednesday at 4 p.m.

To survive the coronavirus, the United States must tighten up

Texto completo: US officials have been implementing a wide range of public health measures to mitigate the damage being wrought by the deadly new coronavirus. While social distancing, better hygiene, and flat-out travel bans may help, we have yet to address one of our biggest vulnerabilities: America's traditionally loose culture. The decentralized, defiant, do-it-your-own-way norms that make our country so entrepreneurial and creative also deepen our danger during the coronavirus crisis. To fight this pandemic, we can't just shift our resources; we have to shift our cultural patterns as well.
Already we can see signs of panic and egocentric behavior. To protect themselves, many Americans are hoarding supplies. Some have even resorted to stealing masks and hand sanitizer from hospitals. We see a disorganized response from state and local governments, delayed and inconsistent reactions from US universities, and until Wednesday— when President Trump banned travel from Europe — a very hands-off approach to an immense collective threat.
These policies reflect a broader cultural phenomenon. In a loose culture like the United States's, Americans are simply not used to tightly coordinating their social action toward a common goal and, compared with other nations, we're more ambivalent about sacrificing our freedom for strict rules that constrain our choices.
America's disorderly response to the coronavirus reflects our cultural conditioning over the last several hundred years. In a paper my colleagues and I published in Science several years ago, we classified countries in terms of how much they prioritized rules over freedom. Tight societies, like China, Singapore, and Austria have many rules and punishments governing social behavior. Citizens in those places are used to a high degree of monitoring aimed at reinforcing good behavior. Loose cultures, in countries such as the United States, Italy, and Brazil, have weaker rules and are much more permissive.
Differences in tightness and looseness aren't random. Countries with the strongest laws and strictest punishments are those with histories of famine, warfare, natural disasters, and, yes, pathogen outbreaks. These disaster-prone nations have learned the hard way over centuries: Tight rules and order save lives. Meanwhile, cultures that have faced few threats — such as the United States — have the luxury of remaining loose. They understandably prioritize freedom over constraint, and they are highly creative and open, but also more disorganized than their tight counterparts.
This trade-off in order versus openness becomes painfully obvious during the early, exponential spread of a virus, when these cultural differences can have profound effects. Famously “tight" societies like Singapore and Hong Kong, for example, have demonstrated the most effective response to Covid-19. Singapore, as of this writing, has recorded zero deaths from the disease. Meanwhile, the lack of coordination and resistance to rules in looser societies massively compounds the risk of widespread infection.
While the Western media have referred to “Draconian" measures Beijing imposed after the initial Wuhan outbreak, China's tight cultural programming effectively slowed the spread of the coronavirus. China has put at least 50 million people under mandatory quarantine, deployed security checks and infrared thermometers at train stations and grocery stores, and is monitoring its citizens' health through smartphones apps like AliPay and WeChat. It's even taking steps to disinfect cash with ultraviolet light and high temperatures.
But it's not just a top-down effort. Concerned about infecting others, Chinese citizens themselves undertook remarkable sacrifices to help mitigate the disease. “They're mobilized, like in a war, and it's fear of the virus that was driving them," said Bruce Aylward, a senior World Health Organization official, in an interview with The New York Times. “They really saw themselves as on the front lines of protecting the rest of China. And the world."
On the flip side, Italy, a loose culture in our data, took days to coordinate a response. Even after a quarantine was announced, thousands of people fled parts of northern Italy, furthering the virus's spread. Italians, used to bending the rules, also wonder whether the quarantine will be enforced, causing more confusion.
In the United States, the response to the virus so far echoes our loose programming. It's been conflicting, unstandardized, and uncoordinated. Universities and public schools are only beginning to cancel classes. Testing efforts remain slow, cumbersome, and haphazard. Confused in this chaotic environment, people are tempted to “defect" and focus on their own interests.
In all of the uncertainty, we need to remember that the trajectory of the virus has as much to do with the nature of the coronavirus as it does with culture. Our loose cultural programming needs to do a big switch in the days to come. Across history, tightening in the face of threat helps populations to survive. Our own remarkable unity during World War II shows that we've been able to shift from loose to tight. Now we need to do it again with strong leadership from the top. By temporarily sacrificing liberty for stricter rules, we'll be able to limit the damage from this disease together.
Michele Gelfand, a professor at the University of Maryland, is the author of “Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire the World."

Texto completo: I wrote about the 11th, penultimate Democratic debate on Monday, but, of course, the world has changed since then.
The event is still scheduled to take place Sunday night from 8 to 10, but it has been moved from Arizona to Washington, D.C. It was first set in Arizona because the state, along with Florida, Illinois, and Ohio, will hold its primary on Tuesday. Also, there will not be a live audience, as originally planned, when Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders take the stage.
Hosts CNN and Univision will air the debate, with moderators Dana Bash, Jake Tapper, and Ilia Calderón asking the questions and, we hope, preventing the candidates from talking over each other. Jorge Ramos, who was on the original moderating team, was replaced by Calderon because he may have been exposed to the coronavirus.

Texto completo: Like most Americans who don't live in the handful of swing states that decide close presidential elections, I've watched the pandering, politicking and passion directed at those lucky voters and wondered, what about us? I'm part of the vast electoral desert.
The primaries have been even worse, as we in the clamorous majority have had to stand by idly as a pair of small, overwhelmingly white states chose the party nominees. Oh, for a negative ad, a robocall, an earnest door-beller.
But all of that changed when Washington state moved its presidential nominating contest up to March 10 - so-called Mini Tuesday, when voters in six states get to weigh in. Washington, with 89 delegates at stake, has the second-largest haul, behind Michigan.
But my vote won't count. It's not because a nursing home in the Seattle area is at the center of the deadly sweep of coronavirus in the United States. Because there is no in-person voting except for a few special exceptions, the virus outbreak may not affect turnout, though election officials have urged people to refrain from licking their mail-in envelopes. The candidates are staying away, and rightfully so. Social distancing, in a public health crisis, is not the same as shunning.
No, the problem is early voting. I cast my ballot by mail last month. I was one of more than 600,000 people in Washington who voted even before the South Carolina primary. Voting at leisure, by mail, is the simplest, easiest way to have your say. You don't even need a stamp.
But I voted for one of the candidates who have since dropped out. That means I will have zero influence on the outcome. If we had ranked choice - in which you could pick a second candidate in case your chosen one failed to make the top tier - it would count. But that's another argument.
Since I mailed in my ballot, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg have dropped out. I should mention that I wrote a column just before Super Tuesday urging all of them to do just that. But what politician ever takes advice from a writer?
My experience is shared by millions of people, especially in California, who voted before the landscape shifted sharply. In essence, we are disenfranchised by our early diligence to democratic duty.
Bernie Sanders is now running some pretty annoying negative ads against Joe Biden in my home state. And his robo-bros have been texting relentlessly. I'd love to have a say.
A friend of mine says you should always wait until the very last minute to vote because, as he quoted the mother of Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor, "Between now and then, a pope will be born."
I never understood what that meant. I do now. And I will never vote before Election Day again.

Texto completo: ST. LOUIS -- Organized events of more than 1,000 people in the city of St. Louis will be prohibited indefinitely to limit the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, city leaders announced Thursday.
The ban came shortly before Gov. Mike Parson announced that a second person in Missouri has tested positive for coronavirus, this one in Greene County in southwestern Missouri. A Ladue woman who recently returned to St. Louis County after studying abroad in Italy was the state's first confirmed case.
St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in the city Thursday and said canceling events was necessary to inhibit potential spread of the virus.
Although the city has no confirmed cases, the extent that the virus may be present here is unknown because testing has been limited. The pattern of COVID-19's reach in other other areas shows "that this virus has been spreading very rapidly," she said.
"This is a pretty devastating situation for many of our businesses and many of our workers," she said at a news conference with area public safety and health officials. "We did not make this decision lightly," she added.
Krewson's decision mirrors those of leaders canceling large events across the country, including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker who banned all public events with more than 1,000 people statewide for 30 days, beginning Thursday. He urged organizers to call off all gatherings of more than 250 people.
Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas also declared a state of emergency Thursday and banned events with more than 1,000 people in his city.
St. Louis County Executive Sam Page is consulting with county health officials on whether to enact a similar ban, Page's chief of staff, Winston Calvert, said Thursday.
Though the true extent of the virus is not clear because testing has been limited, nationally at least 1,500 people in 45 states and Washington, D.C., have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database; at least 39 patients with the virus have died.
There have been several known cases in Missouri's neighboring states. Kansas reported four cases of COVID-19 Thursday evening, all in Johnson County near Kansas City and the Missouri border. Illinois had 32 known cases of coronavirus as of Thursday evening, though some patients have recovered since the start of the outbreak.
Fredrick Echols, head of the St. Louis Health Department, said a confirmed case in St. Louis was likely in the near future. "It's really not a case of if, but when," he said.
As of Thursday, three people in the city had tested negative for the virus, Echols said. Meanwhile, about 20 people across the city and county have been placed under self-quarantine, he said.
Each person, Echols said, either recently had traveled to an area with confirmed cases, or had been exposed to an individual who tested positive for the virus.
'CITY IS PREPARED'
Shortly after Krewson announced the ban, several popular event spaces across the city canceled or postponed dozens of events through April.
Earlier this week, universities across the region called off in-person classes and extended spring breaks. Small events at libraries and businesses have been canceled, as have major ones such as St. Patrick's Day parades.
The ban set Thursday in St. Louis exempts religious events, as well as regular activities at buildings where more than 1,000 people gather for school or work, Echols said.
St. Louis Public Schools students will take spring break next week as scheduled, said Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. If the break is extended, the city has plans to provide meals to children who depend on school breakfasts and lunches.
Krewson on Thursday morning directed the city water department not to shut off water to any business or residence for the next 60 days to ensure people will be able to wash their hands as recommended by public health officials. The order does not affect billing.
The city also placed hand-washing stations throughout downtown St. Louis on Thursday for those without access to soap and water, she said.
The actions are among a list of precautionary measures carried out by St. Louis police and firefighters, jail supervisors, courts officials and health workers in coordination with schools, businesses and institutions. Regional cooperation included activating the Unified Health Command, an emergency response task force across 18 area jurisdictions prepared to respond full time to coronavirus outbreaks.
St. Louis health department workers are establishing emergency plans with city organizations and building managers, Echols said.
The city's jails will limit visits to two days a week, Edwards said. But inmates will only be allowed sit-down visits with their attorneys, he said.
City courts will remain open for now, with a focus on more high-profile cases, said Presiding Judge Rex Burlison. Residents are expected to show up for jury duty if they have a summons, though potential jurors will be asked if they have any symptoms similar to COVID-19. Those without symptoms will be separated at 6-foot intervals in the courthouse, and the courthouse will be deep cleaned.
Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson said paramedics would ask callers a series of questions to determine not only a patient's risk for the virus, but also the risk to themselves. The department has been getting eight to 10 calls a day from people exhibiting symptoms of the flu, he said.
"We're not going to rush into the home and touch somebody to feel how warm they are," he said.
Jenkerson sought to reassure St. Louis residents. The department is looking for evidence of residents contracting coronavirus; ambulances and paramedics are well supplied, he said.
"The city is prepared for this," Jenkerson said. "I am very confident … we will get through this."
Event cancellations and postponements announced Thursday include:
- Chaifetz Arena postponed all events through April 30.
- Edward Jones canceled 15 events at the company's sites through the end of May.
- The Fabulous Fox Theatre postponed performances and tours through March 31.
The Convention and Visitors Commission was working closely with partners and clients affected by the city's event ban, spokesman Anthony Paraino said. The organization promotes conventions and tourism in St. Louis and St. Louis County and runs America's Center Convention Complex, which includes the Dome at America's Center.
"At Explore St. Louis, our first priority is the health, safety, and well-being of everyone visiting or attending an event that is held in our community," Paraino said in a statement. "We certainly understand and respect the decision by the City of St. Louis in restricting large events of 1,000 people."

Pandemic spawns 'infodemic' Surge of misinformation about outbreak stumps social media companies

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - First, there were conspiratorial whispers on social media that the coronavirus had been cooked up in a secret government lab in China. Then there were bogus medicines: gels, liquids and powders that immunized against the virus.
And then there were the false claims about governments and celebrities and racial unrest. Taiwan was covering up virus deaths, and the illness was spiraling out of control. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who now runs a philanthropic organization, was behind the spread of the virus. Italians were marching in the streets, accusing Chinese people of bringing the illness to their country. None of it was true.
As the coronavirus has spread across the world, so, too, has misinformation about it, despite an aggressive effort by social media companies to prevent its dissemination. Facebook, Google and Twitter said they were removing misinformation about the coronavirus as fast as they could find it, and were working with the World Health Organization and other government organizations to ensure that people got accurate information.
But a search by The New York Times found dozens of videos, photographs and written posts on each of the social media platforms that appeared to have slipped through the cracks. The posts were not limited to English. Many were originally in languages ranging from Hindi and Urdu to Hebrew and Farsi, reflecting the trajectory of the virus as it has traveled around the world.
Security researchers have even found that hackers were setting up threadbare websites that claimed to have information about the coronavirus. The sites were actually digital traps, aimed at stealing personal data or breaking into the devices of people who landed on them.
The spread of false and malicious content about the coronavirus has been a stark reminder of the uphill battle fought by researchers and internet companies. Even when the companies are determined to protect the truth, they are often outgunned and outwitted by the internet's liars and thieves.
There is so much inaccurate information about the virus, the WHO has said it was confronting a "infodemic."
"I see misinformation about the coronavirus everywhere. Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other people are spreading conspiracies," said Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
In Taiwan, virus-related misinformation on social media has fed concerns that China might be using the crisis to undermine the government of the self-ruling island.
In recent weeks, there have been posts on Facebook and other sites claiming that Taiwan has concealed large numbers of coronavirus infections. There have been fake but official-looking documents promising giveaways of face masks and vaccines. A screen capture from a television news broadcast was doctored to say that President Tsai Ing-wen had contracted the disease and was in quarantine.
In a statement to The Times, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, blamed China's "internet armies" for the deluge of falsehoods.
The Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of China's territory, and Taiwanese officials have long accused Beijing of manipulating both traditional news media and social platforms to turn Taiwanese citizens against Tsai, who opposes closer ties with China.

Two FAA Officials Are Key Witnesses in Criminal Probe of Ex-Boeing Pilot; Federal aviation staffers dealt with Mark Forkner on pilot-training requirements as part of approval process

Texto completo: Federal authorities are seeking to build a criminal case against a former Boeing Co. pilot based on statements from U.S. air-safety regulators who say he failed to provide them crucial details about the 737 MAX jet's flight-control system, according to people familiar with the matter.
A pair of Federal Aviation Administration officials who dealt with Boeing pilot Mark Forkner on pilot-training requirements for the FAA's approval process years before dual crashes of the MAX are now considered key witnesses in the investigation, these people said.
The central role of FAA officials Stacey Klein and William Schubbe in the criminal probe hasn't been reported before. It suggests Justice Department prosecutors and federal investigators are seeking to center a fraud case on claims that Mr. Forkner misled regulators about how a flight-control feature known as MCAS worked. Ms. Klein oversaw MAX pilot manuals and training, while Mr. Schubbe is a manager in the FAA office that helps determine pilot training requirements for new aircraft.
The automated MCAS system has been blamed for putting two Boeing 737s into fatal nosedives within five months, taking 346 lives, prompting a global grounding of the fleet and creating the most serious corporate crisis in Boeing's history.
A case against Mr. Forkner—who left Boeing for a job with Southwest Airlines Co. after the MAX was certified by the FAA—could lead to liability for the Chicago aerospace giant as well. Prosecutors typically have grounds to charge a company for criminal conduct once they have formally accused an employee of misconduct. Mr. Forkner hasn't cooperated with the investigation, according to people familiar with his situation.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How would you weigh testimony concerning Mark Forkner in light of Boeing's responsibility for its flight-control systems? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Forkner's attorneys, David Gerger and Matt Hennessy, said in a statement that the FAA was aware of how MCAS worked. "As far as Mark goes, he did his job honestly, and his communications to the FAA were honest," Mr. Forkner's lawyers said. "As a pilot and Air Force vet, he would never jeopardize the safety of other pilots or their passengers. That is what any fair investigation would find."
Boeing has cooperated with the federal investigations. The plane maker has said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Forkner's 2016 messages and would share its findings with authorities. Boeing has faulted flawed engineering assumptions about how pilots would respond to MCAS cockpit emergencies, and is devising software and training fixes.
The company, a major defense contractor, has experience dealing with scandal. In 1989 it pleaded guilty to misusing classified Pentagon planning documents and paid $5 million in restitution and fines. In 2006, it paid $615 million to resolve charges of procurement improprieties and signed onto a deferred prosecution agreement, meaning it wouldn't be charged unless it failed to fulfill the terms of the settlement.
Boeing also must navigate an end to a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, one of the people said, which could allege its disclosures to investors didn't fully communicate important facts or risks related to the 737 MAX, which analysts had estimated before the crashes to contribute some 40% of the company's profit.
Ms. Klein couldn't be reached for comment. Through an FAA spokesman, Mr. Schubbe declined to comment. The spokesman said Ms. Klein, Mr. Schubbe and their colleagues are trained to do highly specialized jobs in a professional manner.
Internal Boeing emails from Mr. Forkner, released over the past few months, described pressure he felt from Boeing superiors in 2016 and 2017 to persuade the FAA that pilots wouldn't need extra ground-simulator training on MCAS. Mr. Forkner sent other messages to Boeing employees indicating that, as part of those efforts, he misled or provided incomplete information to the agency as well as airlines and foreign regulators. Congressional investigators, along with other Boeing critics, have highlighted Mr. Forkner's casual remarks regarding safety in those messages.
Mr. Gerger, the lawyer for Mr. Forkner, has previously said the messages should be understood as the comments of employees blowing off steam "in the ups and downs of their jobs."
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Forkner, who at the time was Boeing's chief technical pilot for the 737 MAX, persuaded Ms. Klein's group to remove references to MCAS from aircraft manuals, arguing pilots didn't need to know about the system because it would rarely, if ever, activate, according to his emails.
Ms. Klein has been involved in devising new pilot training for the modified MCAS system, but recently went on leave for a personal reason unrelated to the criminal investigation and the MAX, a person familiar with her testimony said. Aaron Perkins, a former commercial pilot who joined the FAA in 2011 and was involved in the MAX approval process, has taken over her role vetting training related to MCAS software fixes.
Mr. Perkins has told prosecutors he feels Mr. Forkner misled him and his colleagues before the plane went into service, according to one person familiar with his statements. Through an agency spokesman, Mr. Perkins declined to comment.
In August 2016, Ms. Klein was among the FAA employees who participated in test flights of the MAX, which used the final, more powerful version of MCAS, according to people familiar with the matter. It couldn't be learned whether those flights involved tests of MCAS or exposed its potential hazards. An earlier version of the system worked only at high speeds and was less potent.
Mr. Forkner was thrust into the spotlight last year when it emerged that in a 2016 instant message he acknowledged misleading regulators. "So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)," Mr. Forkner told a fellow Boeing pilot, suggesting he hadn't known at the time he talked to the FAA that engineers had modified MCAS to make it more powerful.
Mr. Gerger has said Mr. Forkner was discussing the performance of a simulator built to mirror the handling of a 737 Max. Mr. Forkner believed the problem was with that simulator, Mr. Gerger has said, and not with the plane itself.
Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun has called Mr. Forkner's messages "totally appalling," while company representatives repeatedly have said his communications contradicted Boeing's core values and commitment to safety.
A spokeswoman for Southwest said Mr. Forkner isn't focused on MAX-related work and has complied with company and federal standards applicable to pilots.
Over the months, prosecutors have interviewed current and former Boeing engineers and pilots, airline pilot-union officials and various FAA employees, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Forkner's former boss Zekeriya Demir is among the other Boeing employees who have been called to testify before the grand jury hearing evidence, the people said.
Mr. Demir's testimony hasn't been reported. He couldn't be reached for comment. The New York Times previously reported that prosecutors were gathering grand jury testimony about whether Mr. Forkner misled FAA officials.
Authorities have asked questions about Boeing's safety culture and production problems with the MAX, the people familiar with the matter said. Such information could be used to support any criminal case against Boeing over its communications with regulators, one person close to the investigation said.
Boeing is paying for attorneys to represent current and former employees involved in the investigation, including Mr. Forkner, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.
Any FAA witnesses are likely to face questions about how much authority the agency delegated to Boeing to assess the safety of MCAS before the fleet was cleared to fly passengers, people familiar with the matter said.
Boeing has long insisted the FAA was aware of the system's final configuration, which was described in a letter and a number of presentations to the agency. But different groups within the FAA appeared to only know bits and pieces. An internal FAA review found Boeing didn't flag the more potent version of MCAS as a system whose malfunction could cause a catastrophic accident. Such a designation would have led to more intense FAA scrutiny, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.
Asked whether employees in Ms. Klein's FAA training group were aware of the extent of the modifications to MCAS, FAA chief Steve Dickson told the Journal in December, "it doesn't appear that they were."
Before going on leave, Ms. Klein objected to working with Mr. Forkner's successor, Patrik Gustavsson, who participated in some of the revealing chat conversations, one person familiar with the matter said. Federal criminal authorities are also examining whether Mr. Gustavsson should face charges, another person said. Mr. Gustavsson couldn't be reached for comment.

Texto completo: First, there were conspiratorial whispers on social media that the coronavirus had been cooked up in a secret government lab in China. Then there were bogus medicines: gels, liquids and powders that immunized against the virus.
And then there were the false claims about governments and celebrities and racial unrest. Taiwan was covering up virus deaths, and the illness was spiraling out of control. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who now runs a philanthropic organization, was behind the spread of the virus. Italians were marching in the streets, accusing Chinese people of bringing the illness to their country. None of it was true.
As the coronavirus has spread across the world, so, too, has misinformation about it, despite an aggressive effort by social media companies to prevent its dissemination. Facebook, Google and Twitter said they were removing misinformation about the coronavirus as fast as they could find it, and were working with the World Health Organization and other government organizations to ensure that people got accurate information.
But a search by The New York Times found dozens of videos, photographs and written posts on each of the social media platforms that appeared to have slipped through the cracks. The posts were not limited to English. Many were originally in languages ranging from Hindi and Urdu to Hebrew and Farsi, reflecting the trajectory of the virus as it has traveled around the world.
Security researchers have even found that hackers were setting up threadbare websites that claimed to have information about the coronavirus. The sites were actually digital traps, aimed at stealing personal data or breaking into the devices of people who landed on them.
The spread of false and malicious content about the coronavirus has been a stark reminder of the uphill battle fought by researchers and internet companies. Even when the companies are determined to protect the truth, they are often outgunned and outwitted by the internet's liars and thieves.
There is so much inaccurate information about the virus, the WHO has said it was confronting a "infodemic."
"I see misinformation about the coronavirus everywhere. Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other people are spreading conspiracies," said Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
In Taiwan, virus-related misinformation on social media has fed concerns that China might be using the crisis to undermine the government of the self-ruling island.
In recent weeks, there have been posts on Facebook and other sites claiming that Taiwan has concealed large numbers of coronavirus infections. There have been fake but official-looking documents promising giveaways of face masks and vaccines. A screen capture from a television news broadcast was doctored to say that President Tsai Ing-wen had contracted the disease and was in quarantine.
In a statement to The Times, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, blamed China's "internet armies" for the deluge of falsehoods.
The Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of China's territory, and Taiwanese officials have long accused Beijing of manipulating both traditional news media and social platforms to turn Taiwanese citizens against Tsai, who opposes closer ties with China.

Trump's veto threat throws surveillance bill into chaos

Texto completo: President Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that he might veto a bipartisan surveillance bill, potentially disrupting an agreement to resolve a debate over national security and privacy before three FBI tools for investigating terrorism and espionage expire Sunday.
"Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted 'coup' of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Trump's comments came a day after the House passed a bipartisan bill to extend the expiring tools while also adding safeguards to national-security wiretapping under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.
Several of the president's most vocal allies backed the legislation, and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, enthusiastically urged swift passage of the House's bill.
The president did not explain whether he was suggesting that he might not sign the bill -- negotiated this week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader -- or a short-term extension that Republican senators were contemplating.
But the intervention showed that Trump remains an unpredictable and volatile decision-maker on surveillance legal policy. Republicans in the House thought they had assurances from the White House that Trump would sign their bill before they voted.
If Trump does derail the effort by congressional leaders of both parties to get some kind of bill passed by Sunday, the FBI would at least temporarily lose three powers that lawmakers created after the Sept. 11 attacks. They include the authority to get a court order for business records that are relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation.
Trump and his supporters are invested in promulgating a conspiracy theory that the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Russia's efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election was actually a politically motivated attempt to sabotage his presidency, not a legitimate attempt to understand a foreign power's interference in American democracy.
An investigation by the Justice Department's independent inspector general, Michael Horowitz, concluded that the Russia investigation had a lawful basis and found no evidence that its opening was politically motivated.
Horowitz did, however, uncover serious errors and omissions in one aspect of the inquiry: investigators' applications for permission from the FISA court to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser with many links to Russian officials.
None of the expiring tools was involved in the Page applications. But the legislation to extend them has become a vehicle for Congress to respond to the inspector general's findings. The House bill, for example, would push the FISA court to appoint an outsider to critique the government's arguments when a wiretap application raised serious issues about First Amendment activity, which could include political campaigns.
Even before Trump's Twitter remark, it was uncertain whether the House's rewrite could pass the Senate in time to prevent the expiring FBI tools from temporarily lapsing. Under Senate rules, senators can express their displeasure by slowing legislation moving through the chamber for days, though not stopping it.
In this case, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, was threatening to use procedural tools to prevent passage before the Senate leaves for a weeklong recess because he does not believe the House's language sufficiently protects Americans' civil liberties from government spying.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., another critic of government surveillance, wrote on Twitter that he would "continue to stand" with Trump in opposition to party leaders "trying to ram through fake FISA amendments without any real changes."

Texto completo: Clive Cussler, 88, the author and maritime adventurer who captivated millions with his bestselling tales of suspense and who, between books, led scores of expeditions to find historic shipwrecks and lost treasures in the ocean depths, died Monday at his home in suburban Phoenix, Arizona.
His death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for his publisher, Penguin Random House. No specific cause was given.
Mayan jungles, undersea kingdoms, ghost ships, evil forces out to destroy the world, beautiful women, heroes modeled on himself -- Cussler's vivid literary fantasies and his larger-than-life exploits swirled together for four decades, spinning off some 70 books and locating almost as many shipwrecks.
His work -- mostly action thrillers of the James Bond-Indiana Jones kind, plus nonfiction accounts of his marine quests and a few children's books -- made him a global celebrity.
His book sales have been staggering -- more than 100 million copies, with vast numbers sold in paperback at airports. Translated into 40 or so languages, his books reached The New York Times' bestseller lists more than 20 times, as he amassed a fortune estimated at $80 million.
Often compared to the thrillers churned out by Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum and Ian Fleming, the Cussler novels featured formulaic plots, one- or two-word titles and frequently a recurring hero, Dirk Pitt, an undersea explorer who cheats death and saves the world as he foils the diabolical plots of megalomaniac villains, while satisfying his taste for exotic cars and lusty women.
Cussler was hardly a stylist. Critics called his characters wooden, his dialogue leaden and his prose cliched ("the cold touch of fear," "a narrow brush with death"), while praising his descriptions of marine hardware, underwater struggles and salvage operations.
But readers were swept along on the page-turning tides, and after his commercial breakthrough, "Raise the Titanic!" (1976), his books were frequently on the bestseller lists for months.
Cussler also connected with readers by turning his love for scuba diving into an oceanic lifestyle that paralleled and validated his superhero.
He first created the National Underwater and Marine Agency as a fictional government organization that employed his hero in the Dirk Pitt books. Then, in 1979, he founded an actual National Underwater and Marine Agency as a private nonprofit group committed to "preserving maritime heritage through the discovery, archaeological survey and conservation of shipwreck artifacts." It underwrote his maritime ventures.
His first nonfiction book, "The Sea Hunters" (1996, with Craig Dirgo), was an account of his NUMA exploits, some of which were portrayed in television documentaries featuring Cussler as narrator. Valuable artifacts raised by his expeditions were given to museums or governments.
Cussler, who named his franchise hero after his son Dirk, acknowledged that Dirk Pitt's character was his own alter ego. His later novels, many co-written by his son or others, often included himself as a character who saves the day. His son, a daughter and friends were also used as characters in his books.
"I've been doing Dirk Pitt for 30 years," Cussler told the Times in 2000. "Maybe I can find another writer down the line to take him over. It's not the money; it's the fans.
"I'd like to retire," he continued. "I'm toying with the idea of Pitt having a son who shows up. He's getting a little long in the tooth. When we started out, we were both 36 years old. Now he's a little over 40, and I'm pushing 70."
But 20 years later, he was still churning out books, sometimes two a year. His "Journey of the Pharaohs: A Novel From the NUMA Files," written with Graham Brown, is scheduled to be published in March.

Texto completo: A Brazilian government official who was near President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach over the weekend has tested positive for coronavirus.
Trump, speaking at the White House on Thursday, said he was not concerned.
Early Thursday afternoon, U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said he was going into self-quarantine after his office was alerted by the Brazilian Embassy that he'd been in contact with a member of President Jair Bolsonaro's delegation who tested positive for coronavirus.
Scott's contact was two days later than Trump's and Pence's.
In a statement from his office, Scott said he met with the Brazilians on Monday in Miami. "While I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me. The embassy said the person had no symptoms leading up to or the day of the conference. After consulting with the Senate's attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don't need to take a test or quarantine. However, the health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine in an abundance of caution.
"I am feeling healthy and not experiencing any symptoms at this time. I will still be working on my plan to combat coronavirus and protect American families, and my offices in D.C. and throughout the state will still be fully operational to help Floridians," Scott said.
Trump did not respond to multiple questions from reporters about whether there's any reconsideration of whether the Brazilian's official's results mean he should get tested, according to ABC News.
"I did hear something about that," Trump said when asked about Bolsonaro himself being tested.
"We had dinner together in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago, with the entire delegation, the press aide was there, he was there but we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time," Trump said.
The New York Times and other news accounts reported that the official, Fábio Wajngarten, the communications chief for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's, was part of the delegation at the president's South Florida home. The delegation dined with the president on Saturday.
Wajngarted posted a photo on Instagram showing him posing with the president.
Reuters reported that Bolsonaro is being monitored and tested for coronavirus, according to a report in the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.
Reuters said it could not confirm the report.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - First, there were conspiratorial whispers on social media that the coronavirus had been cooked up in a secret government lab in China. Then there were bogus medicines: gels, liquids and powders that immunized against the virus.
And then there were the false claims about governments and celebrities and racial unrest. Taiwan was covering up virus deaths, and the illness was spiraling out of control. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who now runs a philanthropic organization, was behind the spread of the virus. Italians were marching in the streets, accusing Chinese people of bringing the illness to their country. None of it was true.
As the coronavirus has spread across the world, so, too, has misinformation about it, despite an aggressive effort by social media companies to prevent its dissemination. Facebook, Google and Twitter said they were removing misinformation about the coronavirus as fast as they could find it, and were working with the World Health Organization and other government organizations to ensure that people got accurate information.
But a search by The New York Times found dozens of videos, photographs and written posts on each of the social media platforms that appeared to have slipped through the cracks. The posts were not limited to English. Many were originally in languages ranging from Hindi and Urdu to Hebrew and Farsi, reflecting the trajectory of the virus as it has traveled around the world.
Security researchers have even found that hackers were setting up threadbare websites that claimed to have information about the coronavirus. The sites were actually digital traps, aimed at stealing personal data or breaking into the devices of people who landed on them.
The spread of false and malicious content about the coronavirus has been a stark reminder of the uphill battle fought by researchers and internet companies. Even when the companies are determined to protect the truth, they are often outgunned and outwitted by the internet's liars and thieves.
There is so much inaccurate information about the virus, the WHO has said it was confronting a "infodemic."
"I see misinformation about the coronavirus everywhere. Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other people are spreading conspiracies," said Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
In Taiwan, virus-related misinformation on social media has fed concerns that China might be using the crisis to undermine the government of the self-ruling island.
In recent weeks, there have been posts on Facebook and other sites claiming that Taiwan has concealed large numbers of coronavirus infections. There have been fake but official-looking documents promising giveaways of face masks and vaccines. A screen capture from a television news broadcast was doctored to say that President Tsai Ing-wen had contracted the disease and was in quarantine.
In a statement to The Times, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, blamed China's "internet armies" for the deluge of falsehoods.
The Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of China's territory, and Taiwanese officials have long accused Beijing of manipulating both traditional news media and social platforms to turn Taiwanese citizens against Tsai, who opposes closer ties with China.

Texto completo: The COVID-19 pandemic is having an extensive impact on the Pensacola sports community.
As of Thursday, the New York Times compiled nearly 1,300 reported cases from Center for Disease Control databases and other local health organizations, a number that had increased by approximately 100 cases per day since Saturday.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic at press conference in Geneva, Switzerland.
Over two dozen cases have been reported in Florida, including a 71-year-old man from Santa Rosa County who died at Baptist Hospital last Friday. The patient had pre-existing health conditions and recently returned from an international trip.
On Thursday, Escambia County and the city of Pensacola announced the cancellation of all events with expected crowd of 500 or more people for two weeks in conjunction with recommendations from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The outbreak has impacted sports communities across the country: The NBA and MLS suspended their regular seasons, MLB delayed the start of its regular season, and the NCAA canceled all winter and spring championships.
Below is a running list of COVID-19's growing impact on the Pensacola sports scene:
High school sports The FHSAA released a statement on Thursday afternoon that its COVID-19 stance would be to delegate decision-making to individual schools and school districts.
In situations where one team backs out of a scheduled game, no forfeits will be counted. Instead, games will be stricken from schedules, and neither school will be awarded a win or loss in the event that a makeup game can't be decided.
The FHSAA has not made a final decision on the status of its spring sports state championships and will continue to work with health officials, school districts and host venues on the process.
Should spring championships be held, the current qualification structure will be honored while the FHSAA executive director will consider waiving minimum contest requirements for student-athletes.
The FHSAA is in its spring sports season with outdoor sports such as baseball and softball most prominent.
On Thursday afternoon, Escambia County athletic director Roger Mayo said competition will continue for now between programs in Escambia County and Santa Rosa County.
Mayo said there may be case-by-case exceptions, particularly for schools like Northview that need access to Alabama's neighboring rural schools to continue competition.
Games against programs from outside the two counties, including invitational baseball tournaments like Tate's Aggie Classic and Pine Forest's Beach Bash, have been postponed or canceled.
Mayo noted that the situation was changing by the hour, and he wouldn't be surprised to see other counties cancelling all spring sports, as has been done in some South Florida counties.
"Hopefully our programs can still get in some games and players can still showcase abilities and enjoy their seasons," Mayo said. "Bottom line is that if you're going to make a mistake or error it has to be with the safety of the students in mind.
"If NBA won't allow grown men to be on the court to play basketball and NCAA won't allow their players to play baseball. ... Who are we to put 15-, 16- or 17-year-olds out there in those settings?"
Additionally, individual athletes and coaches have reported cancelling plans to participate in non-school affiliated competitions both domestically and internationally due to COVID-19 concerns.
Collegiate sports On Thursday afternoon, the NCAA announced the cancellation of all winter and spring championship tournaments, ending collegiate athletics postseasons for the 2019-20 season.
Earlier in the day, University of West Florida athletics announced limited attendance at all home events from March 13-30 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
All UWF athletic programs will be brought back to Pensacola and the baseball and softball team's scheduled series against Lee in Tennessee this weekend have been canceled.
UWF officials are expected to make an announcement on the status of the remaining spring sports schedules on Friday morning.
The UWF tennis team was scheduled to compete in San Antonio, Texas, this weekend while the UWF swimming and diving team was in Ohio for the NCAA Championships.
Additionally, UWF football's spring practices, which open March 17, will be closed to the public.
The Florida Board of Governors also announced on Wednesday afternoon that UWF students would conduct online-only classes for two weeks following the end of this week's spring break.
Professional sports On Thursday afternoon, Minor League Baseball announced that opening day would be delayed. Opening Day for the 2020 season will be announced at a later date.
In addition to Pensacola Blue Wahoos baseball, several college and high school baseball games are scheduled to be held at Blue Wahoos Stadium.
Beginning March 18, Blue Wahoos Stadium will host the Studer Blue Wahoos Challenge featuring 10 college baseball teams from eight different states, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky and Georgia.
The University of West Florida baseball team is scheduled to face the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater at Blue Wahoos Stadium on March 24, while several local high school teams are scheduled to play games in the stadium at the end of March as part of the annual Battle on the Bay series.
This weekend's ARCA Menards Series race at Five Flags Speedway has been postponed due to nationwide and local health concerns relating to COVID-19.
Five Flags Speedway has not announced a rescheduled date for the ARCA Pensacola 200, but officials are working through potential dates later in the season. Fans who have purchased tickets are asked to hold onto them until further notice.
The Pensacola Ice Flyers have five remaining home games left in their regular season. The Southern Professional Hockey League has not announced any schedule or policy changes in reaction to COVID-19.
Youth sports For an organization like Pensacola Youth Soccer – which started its first season practices on Monday – the virus is being treated much like an impending hurricane.
Phil Nickinson, president of Pensacola Youth Soccer, said he expects his organization to keep an eye on local COVID-19 developments and work with city government officials should changes be needed.
Individually, Nickinson said he wants his organization to use the virus as an opportunity to emphasize good hygienic habits to young athletes while being honest about the situation.
"It wouldn't surprise me if we see people standing a little further than normally," Nickinson said. "But really it's about the common sense more than anything. ... It helps that we're an outdoor sport so we're not cramming 100 or so people into an arena."

Texto completo: A Brazilian government official who was near President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach over the weekend has tested positive for coronavirus.
Trump, speaking at the White House on Thursday, said he was not concerned.
Early Thursday afternoon, U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said he was going into self-quarantine after his office was alerted by the Brazilian Embassy that he'd been in contact with a member of President Jair Bolsonaro's delegation who tested positive for coronavirus.
Scott's contact was two days later than Trump's and Pence's.
In a statement from his office, Scott said he met with the Brazilians on Monday in Miami. "While I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me. The embassy said the person had no symptoms leading up to or the day of the conference. After consulting with the Senate's attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don't need to take a test or quarantine. However, the health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine in an abundance of caution.
"I am feeling healthy and not experiencing any symptoms at this time. I will still be working on my plan to combat coronavirus and protect American families, and my offices in D.C. and throughout the state will still be fully operational to help Floridians," Scott said.
Trump did not respond to multiple questions from reporters about whether there's any reconsideration of whether the Brazilian's official's results mean he should get tested, according to ABC News.
"I did hear something about that," Trump said when asked about Bolsonaro himself being tested.
"We had dinner together in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago, with the entire delegation, the press aide was there, he was there but we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time," Trump said.
The New York Times and other news accounts reported that the official, Fábio Wajngarten, the communications chief for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's, was part of the delegation at the president's South Florida home. The delegation dined with the president on Saturday.
Wajngarted posted a photo on Instagram showing him posing with the president.
Reuters reported that Bolsonaro is being monitored and tested for coronavirus, according to a report in the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo. Reuters said it could not confirm the report.

COVID-19: A crisis of health and a crisis of confidence Orlando Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: During a public health crisis, Americans should be able to rely on government at all levels to work the problem, find solutions and keep people safe.
With the coronavirus, we're witnessing a crisis of confidence in government, brought on by secrecy, lies, uncertainty and ineptitude.
Let's go down the list.
Secrecy:The Trump administration ordered meetings about the coronavirus to be treated as classified, which meant people without security clearances were excluded from those meetings.
Here in Florida, the Orlando Sentinel contacted several Central Florida counties this week to find out how many coronavirus tests had been administered. They refused to reveal the numbers, using the absurd excuse that it might violate patient privacy.
Lies:We know President Donald Trump lies with ease, but he's outdone himself during this crisis. On Feb. 24, he tweeted that the virus was under control. It wasn't.
During Friday's tour of the Centers for Disease Control, the president said "anyone who wants a (coronavirus) test can get a test." His own administration had to walk back that lie the next day.
Other examples abound. We just don't have room for them all.
Uncertainty:No one really has any idea how widespread the virus is, in part because testing for it has been so scarce. While South Korea is testing about 20,000 people a day, the United State is testing just a fraction of that.
As of Wednesday, Florida had performed fewer than 500 tests, this in a state that lives and breathes visitors, many from other nations. How can that be?
And there's this: On Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the trustworthy administration voices on coronavirus, said Florida was one of four states with "community spread," which means the virus is spreading withing a particular area. On Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis said that wasn't true. Who's right?
Ineptitude: Earlier this week, Florida's Department of Health sent out a news release that created confusion about who should self-quarantine after returning from an overseas trip. A few hours later, the DOH clarified it only meant people returning from high-risk countries like China and Italy.
After Wednesday night's address to the nation, the White House scrambled to clarify fact errors, like the president's statement that a travel ban for Europe included cargo. No wonder financial markets are tanking.
The instances above are just examples of a wider perception that neither Florida nor the nation was prepared for this, which shouldn't come as a huge surprise.
For years, we've seen a growing contempt for the government by the very people elected to run the government.
In his inaugural address in 1981, President Ronald Reagan famously said, "Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem."
Some politicians now wear their government-is-the-problem beliefs like a badge of honor. They work to fulfill those beliefs by trying to hollow out the institutions of government so it can be made smaller.
At no time in recent history has that been more evident than with the current administration in Washington, where critical positions are held open or sometimes filled with hacks who are designated as "acting" to avoid Senate scrutiny.
A couple of years ago, the administration gutted the team created by then-President Barack Obama after the Ebola outbreak to coordinate responses to pandemics.
Less government might sound enticing when it's applied to bureaucratic red tape, less so when it means you can't get basic medical tests during a pandemic.
The private sector has a role in times like these by ensuring supply chains are maintained and making responsible decisions, like the NBA suspending its season on Wednesday. Painful as it might be for fans, it was a courageous call.
But the private sector isn't equipped to cope with a national emergency. Americans must put their faith in government to manage a crisis such as this.
That requires the people we elect to believe in the institutions they're responsible for and to keep them healthy and ready for the moment when America needs them.
That may not make for good campaign slogans, but it makes a state and nation better prepared to deal with an emergency.
Better prepared, at least, than we were for this one.

Employers must offer paid sick leave. Now.

Texto completo: Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, set a standard for the rest of the private sector on Tuesday by announcing that, in addition to its existing paid sick leave policy, it would provide up to two weeks of paid leave for employees who fall ill or are quarantined because of a confirmed exposure to the coronavirus.
It's now incumbent upon other American employers to match that example.
Companies that do not provide paid sick leave to all employees, particularly those in the retail and restaurant industries, are endangering their workers and customers. Studies show that paying for sick employees to stay home significantly reduces the spread of the seasonal flu. There's every reason to think it would help to check the spread of the new coronavirus, too.
But many of the nation's big restaurant chains, in particular, do not provide paid sick leave. Nationwide, only 45% of workers in the hotel and food service industries get paid sick days, compared with 97% in the financial industry, according to the latest federal data. The list of restaurants that don't pay sick workers to stay home is a roll call of familiar brands, including Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Jack in the Box, Wendy's and Panera.
One consequence: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2014 that "one in five food service workers have reported working at least once in the previous year while sick with vomiting or diarrhea."
Other developed nations, and several American states and cities, already mandate some form of paid sick leave, and some congressional Democrats have seized the coronavirus moment to push for a change in federal law. Such a change is long overdue, and would be welcome news.
But it is not sufficient, by itself, to meet the demands of the moment.
Public health officials recommend that people exposed to the coronavirus remain in isolation for 14 days. Even companies that provide sick leave are rarely that generous. Accordingly, the proposed legislation would also require up to 14 days of paid sick leave during public health emergencies.
One flaw in the proposal is that it would require employers to foot the bill, even as many companies are facing a drop in revenue. The government should absorb the cost of the emergency sick leave provisions by giving companies a tax credit. Americans needn't wait on Washington – particularly because any change in federal law depends on President Trump's willingness to act in the public interest.
People looking for a place to eat can protect their own health, and encourage restaurant chains to do the right thing, by patronizing places that offer paid sick leave.
Eleven states, beginning with Connecticut in 2012, already have passed laws requiring large employers to offer paid sick leave. The list now includes New York and California, as well as a number of large cities, including Washington, D.C. But companies can sidestep those regulations by categorizing workers as contractors, and laws require enforcement.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Weinstein: Why is Rutgers holding his $100,000?

Texto completo: Convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein has been sent to prison, but Rutgers University won't let go of his money.
Rutgers has decided to hold on to a $100,000 gift from the disgraced Hollywood mogul to help fund a campus feminist studies program despite his dual convictions of rape and sexual assault and his sentencing Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in lower Manhattan.
Weinstein, 67, was slammed with a 23-year prison sentence for raping an aspiring actress and forcibly performing oral sex on a female production assistant.
Weinstein's money is helping to pay for an endowed professorship named after feminist icon Gloria Steinem. His donation arrived at Rutgers just two months before his history of abusive behavior toward women was revealed in lengthy investigative reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker.
Rutgers at the time refused to send Weinstein's money back – or donate it to a charitable cause. Weinstein had not even been charged with any crimes yet.
But now, in the wake of Weinstein's conviction Feb. 24 in New York on charges of third-degree rape and first degree sexual assault against two women, that decision by Rutgers has resurfaced.
The verdicts followed a wrenching six-week trial that was considered a political and historical touchstone for the campaign to draw attention to sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinstein's conviction and likely prison sentence now begs this question: Why would any university use Weinstein's money to now fund studies in feminism?
In a statement Monday explaining why it was keeping the cash, Rutgers spokeswoman Dory Devlin pointed out that Weinstein was not the only donor. More than 425 people contributed $3 million to the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies.
Devlin, the senior director of Rutgers News & Media Relations, said Weinstein and his family's foundation contributed the $100,000 in August 2017 in honor of his late mother, "who shared Gloria Steinem's hopes for female equality."
Devlin added that Rutgers believes "that applying these funds to advance women's equality has been a good use of the donation."
She said the money "helped fund the endowed chair's efforts to teach, conduct research and immerse students in debate and scholarship on the relationships between media, politics, market forces and democracy."
In its statement, Rutgers did not comment on Weinstein's conviction — or the seeming contradiction of partially funding women's studies with money from a rapist. Also, neither Steinem nor the current Rutgers chair of feminist studies, Naomi Klein, responded to requests for comment.
Weinstein's possible prison sentence looms as yet another chapter in what has become known as the #MeToo movement.
In recent years, numerous women have come forward with accusations that led to the downfall of a wide variety of influential men, ranging from Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota to CBS executive Les Moonves and NBC's Matt Lauer.
Weinstein is considered the most notorious of the bunch, however. And his trial was viewed as one of the first legal tests of efforts to not only force sexual offenders from their jobs but to send them to jail.
In its presentencing letter to the judge, Weinstein's defense team wrote that he suffered a "historic" fall from grace as a result of the #MeToo movement.
Nearly 90 women in the film industry, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchette, Rosanna Arquette and Rose McGowanaccused Weinstein of some form of sexual misconduct or harassment.
Most of those incidents could not be cited in the New York trial, however. They either took place outside New York or were beyond the statute of limitations for crimes. Other incidents did not amount to crimes but were considered by prosecutors to be improper workplace harassment.
Weinstein's trial in New York focused on just two noncelebrity women — an aspiring actress and a production assistant for the TV show, "Project Runway."
The actress, Jessica Mann, said Weinstein raped her at a Manhattan hotel. The production assistant, Miriam Haley, said Weinstein forced her to let him perform oral sex on her.
But the women's testimony was complicated by the fact that each conceded they maintained cordial relationships with Weinstein after their assaults and even engaged in consensual sex with him. Mann, now 34, called Weinstein a "soulmate." Haley, 42, who is sometimes referred to as "Mimi Haleyi," admits she flirted with Weinstein.
In an attempt to show Weinstein's predatory style, Judge Burke allowed prosecutors to introduce testimony from four other women including Sopranos star Annabella Sciorra who said Weinstein raped her in the 1990s.
The prosecution's gamble failed. The jury of seven men and five women found Weinstein not guilty on the two most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, which could have resulted in a life sentence for him. Weinstein also was acquitted of first degree rape.
In an 11-page court filing last week calling for a lengthy prison sentence, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office resurrected its argument about Weinstein's history of alleged abusive behavior.
Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, in highlighting three dozen uncharged incidents, wrote that Weinstein carried on a "lifetime of abuse towards others, sexual and otherwise."
"Starting in the 1970s, he has trapped women into his exclusive control and assaulted or attempted to assault them," Illuzzi-Orbon said.
Weinstein faces another criminal trial in Los Angeles on charges that he raped one woman and sexually assaulted another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013. Law enforcement officials in Great Britain and Canada also are reportedly investigating Weinstein on sexual charges.
The accusations against Weinstein first emerged in October 2017 in reports in The New York Times and in The New Yorker. They coincided with a report two months earlier that Rutgers had accepted a gift of $100,000 from Weinstein for the Gloria Steinem chair.
Critics quickly demanded that Rutgers send the money back to Weinstein — or donate it to another charity. Rutgers refused, even though the University of Southern California turned down Weinstein's donation of $5 million to endow scholarships for women filmmakers.
At the time, Rutgers called the allegations against Weinstein "appalling and indefensible."
But it said "more work is needed to advance women's equality" and Weinstein's donation "will help those efforts."
"We think devoting these funds to advance women's equality," Rutgers said in a statement, "is a better use of the dollars than returning the donation to Harvey Weinstein and the H. Weinstein Family Foundation."

Vote keeps Decatur hospital open for now

Texto completo: The future of Decatur County General Hospital hangs in the balance.
The hospital's board voted unanimously Tuesday to keep Tennessee's latest at-risk rural hospital open, in direct opposition to the Decatur County Commission's March 5 vote to shut it down.
The community-owned hospital, located in the 2,300-person town of Parsons, is the only emergency health facility in a rural county spanning 345 square miles.
"There's some people that want to keep the hospital open. ... They hate to see it go," said Billy Goodman, a Decatur County commissioner of at least 24 years. "The majority of the people want it to close because they know we can't afford it. It's not going to make it. The writing's on the wall."
The hospital board has full authority over Decatur County General Hospital, but the county commission controls the taxpayer money that funds the facility. Goodman and other commissioners voiced concerns Tuesday that taxpayers continue to foot the bill for a facility hemorrhaging money and staff.
Over the past several years, the hospital has accumulated around $3 million in debt and struggles to meet its payroll costs. Hospital staff who have stayed through the turbulence are now looking for other work or reducing their hours as closure appears increasingly imminent.
Decatur County General, built in 1965, could be the 12th rural Tennessee hospital to close since 2012. West Tennessee has been hit particularly hard, recently losing hospitals in Gibson, Haywood, McNairy and Carroll counties.
Hospital CEO Melinda Hays-Kirkwood said losing the hospital would be "devastating" for the county.
"If you don't have a health care infrastructure in some way, lives are going to be lost," she said.
Representatives from Braden Health, a private company slated to take ownership of nearby Henderson County Community Hospital on March 31, made a last-minute pitch to purchase Decatur County General Tuesday.
The pitch was the third the board and county commission have heard in the past four years. Community leaders agreed to partner with NorthCrest Medical Center in Sept. 2016 in an effort to save the hospital, but the company quickly bowed out, leaving the county to pay the bill for its operating costs.
On Jan. 31, the hospital's most recent manager, Progressive Medical Group, similarly defaulted on its agreement and "disappeared," leaving suspicions of fraud in their wake, Goodman said.
Hays-Kirkwood confirmed Tuesday that the hospital is under investigation by the Tennessee Comptroller's Office, though she could not provide details.
Money and staffing woes The hospital holds 40 beds, but typically staffs only five per day, according to state reports. On average, the facility sees less than one patient daily.
But Hays-Kirkwood said its existence is vital for the area's aging population and those who need emergency treatment after suffering ATV, horse, or boating accidents.
"People complain that all they do is patch you up and transfer you out," she said. "That's right. It's a rural hospital, and they do what needs to be done in an emergency situation and get people stabilized to send them out (to specialized facilities)."
If the hospital closes, the closest specialized facility is Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, about an hour away. Other rural hospitals, including Henderson County Community, are closer, but still require an estimated 15-minute ambulance ride.
With news of its previous management company's default and the county commission's vote to shut it down, Hays-Kirkwood said people don't know that the hospital is still open. Patients have called to see if they can still get their blood work done there.
Financial struggles that have plagued the hospital for years have worsened in the fallout from its two past management companies. A $60 wheel tax meant to provide extra funds for the facility made only a small dent.
"If we doubled the property tax and added on a $100 wheel tax for the hospital, it still would not save that hospital," Goodman said.
The strain is also resulting in shrinking staff: 20 people have recently left or reduced their hours. The hospital's director of nursing has worked for 14 days straight to cover the open shifts. Hays-Kirkwood said she has enough staff to cover the next two weeks, but the future is uncertain.
"The whole thing is a safety issue: an overworked, understaffed hospital," Decatur County Commissioner Anthony Alexander said. "We've got the best people. They're staying until the bitter end, but there's been so many people that have left. I don't think they can function safely."
Braden Health makes last-minute pitch to buy Beau Braden, manager of Braden Health, introduced a potential deal to purchase the hospital Tuesday. No financial agreement had been discussed prior to the meeting, officials said.
Braden said the company specializes in transforming rural hospitals, and he saw an opportunity to share some of the administrative costs with Henderson County Community Hospital (HCCH), which will be in Braden Health's control by April.
Braden Health is a registered LLC in Florida and North Carolina. The New York Times wrote an article about Braden's efforts to build a small hospital in a struggling Florida town in 2018. HCCH is the company's first project in Tennessee.
Though no official deal is on the table, Braden said his offer would be to buy out the hospital without assuming the responsibility of any previous fraud, including issues his team spotted after reviewing Decatur County General's books for about 15 minutes Tuesday morning.
The rough proposal includes plans to streamline the hospital's systems and administration, add telemedicine options and purchase updated equipment.
"We're here to try to figure out a way to invest in your community and keep your rural hospital open," Braden said.
Hays-Kirkwood said she has four questions about a potential sale:
What is going to be the significant revenue stream?
What kind of investment is the company willing to make?
How will the company fix the hospital's billing issues?
What will the company do with the hospital's debt?
Braden said his lawyer could provide a bank letter to ensure sufficient funds, but the details of those concerns were not discussed in-depth as county officials had not yet entered into negotiations with the company.
Alexander said anyone who wanted to purchase the hospital would have to get the approval of the attorney general, as the facility is owned by the taxpayers.
"That's the third time we've heard the same story," he said. "I'm not taking anything away from the man, I'm sure he's done great things, but we've heard that same thing three different times."
What happens if the hospital does close? HCCH Chief Nursing Officer Gary Stewart knows that if Decatur County General closes, his facility will be the community's closest medical facility.
Stewart has attended every recent hospital board and Decatur County Commission meeting to keep up with closure discussions and prepare his own staff for what may come next.
If emergency medical staff cannot fly a Decatur County patient to the nearest hospital, it's likely that they will be brought to HCCH to be stabilized for travel.
Many patients from Decatur County already come to HCCH for treatment, he said, especially in the last few months. In the event of a closure, HCCH's 911 call service would work with Decatur County's service to handle the call volume, and Henderson County may provide additional ambulances during the transition period.
Goodman and Alexander said Decatur County's ambulance services will need to expand, at the very least adding another team of EMTs.
The county currently has five ambulances and staffs two on any given day, according to Goodman.
"That's going to be our lifeline," Alexander said.
Teddy Myracle, who joined the hospital board in November, spent 46 years working in emergency medical services as an EMT and paramedic. In his career, he has seen seven hospitals close.
"It is not a pretty sight," he said.
Hays-Kirkwood said closure could cost as much as $3.5 million and come with a variety of other costs. Elderly community members receiving long-term care, for example, would need regular ambulance rides to other hospitals.
Myracle fears that any mass accident or coincidental onslaught of calls for help could overrun the county's ambulance capability in a matter of minutes. The more time it takes to get to a hospital, the more things can go wrong, he said.
Machines are limited in an ambulance, and equipment can fail. Decatur County may not be able to find more EMTs and paramedics to staff additional ambulances.
"No matter how good your EMS system is, it's not good enough," he said.
Discussion concerning the hospital's future will continue at the hospital board meeting on March 23 at 7 p.m.

Jazz hands now to stop the coronavirus

Texto completo: Over the weekend, the Italian government imposed a massive quarantine on nearly 16 million; it also closed schools and universities and suspended all sporting events. By midweek, the quarantine applied to the whole country. The government is also proposing to ban handshakes and even cheek kisses. When it comes to personal greetings, the novel coronavirus is turning social mores on their head.
In recent days other countries have followed suit. Government officials in France and Switzerland, according to The New York Times, have asked citizens to temporarily halt what's known as "la bise," the two-kiss greeting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now supports greeting others with "namaste" instead of a traditional handshake. Here at home, Vice President Mike Pence was videoed deploying the "elbow bump" instead of extending his right hand.
In that vein, I wondered whether Italian authorities (and others) had gotten their "no kiss" decree from the latest edition of Broadway Beat, an online magazine whose tagline is "Fake Broadway News for Real Broadway Newsies." A banner headline reads: "CDC urges citizens to avoid spreading coronavirus by greeting exclusively with jazz hands." According to the report, a made-up spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged "everyone to stop shaking hands immediately. Instead, we suggest greeting people in a manner both more sanitary and, frankly, more fabulous: jazz hands. If we have any hope of saving the world from this crippling disease, by God, it is with sassy, interpretative movement."
Coincidentally, I had made the same decision earlier in the week after North Carolina reported its first cases of coronavirus. While I'm hale and hearty, I've got friends and family members who are considered at high risk of this new coronavirus (that causes the disease known as COVID-19), either because they are over 60 or have underlying health problems. I want to make sure I don't become a carrier, inadvertently infecting them.
Just before the weekend, I walked into our local coffee shop, a place where everyone knows my name. Typically, there are all sorts of greetings – from handshakes to hugs, even some of that European-style cheek-to-cheek kissing. We're very cosmopolitan in Hillsborough.
As soon as I walked through the café's door, my friend Margo rushed from her chair to greet me. I know that she's a hugger and a kisser, and that she has spent a good deal of time in Italy. I stopped her dead in her tracks: "Margo!" I said with my outside voice, "I'm modeling manners in the Age of the Coronavirus. Keep your distance!" She laughed at me and continued to shrink the social distance between us. I then performed what I call my "namaste bow," folding my arms with a dip of the head. She looked dead straight at me, asking: "You're serious, aren't you?"
I was. I am. Public health officials are hoping that this change in our social habits may play a role in slowing this contagion.
But how do you reject a handshake, hug or kiss tactfully – especially if you live in a community with documented cases of coronavirus, or if some of your nearest and dearest are considered at high risk like older people and those with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, lung problems and weakened immune systems. (For instance, my sister – who has cancer – has a 3 1/2 times the risk of needing a ventilator or "other intensive care" should she become infected, according to STAT. If protecting her – and others – by refusing to shake hands or social kiss with friends and strangers, I'll make that choice.)
"It's really awkward to change social habits that could spread it," Bryce Eberhart, a marketing communications consultant, told me. (Eberhart lives in San Francisco, which is covered by California Gov. Gavin Newsom's state of emergency in response to the coronavirus.)
Humor, with the right public health message, is certainly one means to raise awareness. "The Late Show" host Stephen Colbert introduced us to a handful of new ways to greet each other last week, including the "Wuhan Shake," which is actually shoe bumping. Then there's "The Selfie," where you shake hands – with yourself – and "The Intern," no doubt a Hollywood-only phenomenon, which adds handshaking for your boss to a lowly assistant's job description. Alas, humor only takes us so far.
All this talk about changing behavior in the face of infection brings back memories from the earliest days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. I remember, awkwardly, first starting to use condoms with new sexual partners. Did this imply I was infected? I wasn't, but that wasn't the point. Many of my friends simply didn't know their HIV status, which was why widespread condom use was crucial.
At the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, where I worked, we developed a public health campaign titled "Be A Rubberman," which explicitly sought to make condom use a no-brainer in the gay men's community. One of the billboards, featuring a young man wearing only a pair of white boxers with a condom in his hand, declared in text: "I know tops get AIDS, but not this one. ... I use rubbers every time. DO YOU?"
Hector Carrillo, then a coordinator of the AIDS Foundation hotline and now a professor of sociology and gender studies at Northwestern, reminded me in a call that "the invention of safe sex and the emphasis on condom use was seen as an alternative to more draconian measures like asking gay men to stop having sex or closing the gay bars." (San Francisco did controversially shutter its gay bathhouses in 1984 as a means to halt the spread of the disease, known then as the "gay plague.") Such prevention campaigns, Dr. Carrillo said, "helped gay men change their attitudes and in turn their behaviors."
Does he see parallels to the current epidemic? "Yes," he said, "we're seeing an initial emphasis on the need to alter interactions like shaking hands, casual kissing and embracing."
With widespread adoption, let's hope that it may be possible to avoid more draconian measures like government-imposed quarantines, the school closings and the suspension of concerts and sporting events. Or, God forbid, the tattooing of those infected, a measure proposed by the late conservative writer William F. Buckley vis a vis those infected with HIV.
Over the weekend I had friends in for dinner. I have also learned the importance of being direct; the night before I emailed, "Alas, I am serious: We will greet each other with elbow bumps or namaste bows! And I will have individual hand towels in the bathroom."
When I do my "namaste bow" – instead of embracing or kissing you – understand this is a small price to pay in lieu of a much larger one. Last month, Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, wrote in Scientific American, "We should prepare, not because we may feel personally at risk, but so that we can help lessen the risk for everyone."
Jazz hands now, everyone. (Oh, and don't forget to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.)

Weinstein faces LA trial: What's next?

Texto completo: Now that former Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for two sex crimes in New York, the action will shift to Los Angeles where he has been charged with similar sex crimes that could net him more years in prison if convicted.
In fact, on Wednesday following his New York sentence, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced she had begun the process of extraditing Weinstein to California to face charges that were filed there in January. He has not yet been arraigned.
Weinstein was sentenced Wednesday in Manhattan to a total of 23 years in prison: 20 years for his conviction on first-degree criminal sexual act and three years for his conviction on third-degree rape, involving two victims.
The New York jury delivered is verdict on Feb. 24, after a trial that opened on Jan. 6. On the same day his trial began in New York, prosecutors in Los Angeles announced they had charged Weinstein with four sex crimes similar to the New York charges.
In Los Angeles County, he is charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over two days in Beverly Hills hotel rooms in 2013, for a total of four counts: one felony count each of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint.
The Los Angeles County charges involve two accusers, an Italian model whose name has not been disclosed and Lauren Young, an aspiring actress who testified as a "prior bad acts" witness in the New York case. She says Weinstein trapped her in a bathroom at a Beverly Hills hotel where he groped her in February 2013.
Weinstein was acquitted in New York of the three most serious charges against him, including first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault, which could have gotten him a life sentence.
In court, one of his lawyers, Donna Rotunno, said that because of his "multitude" of medical issues, there's a good chance Weinstein could die in prison even if he had been sentenced to the minimum of five years.
The verdict and sentence in New York meant Lacey would want to start the extradition process against Weinstein as soon as possible after sentencing. Because, the thinking goes, if he is convicted on the most serious charges in Los Angeles, Weinstein could be sentenced to up to 28 years in prison in California.
After the sentencing in New York, Gloria Allred, who represents multiple accusers of Weinstein including Lauren Young, vowed to reporters that she would see Weinstein again soon.
"Because the Los Angeles case – the criminal case against Mr. Weinstein – will move forward," she said.
The New York sentence "is not helpful" for Weinstein's prospects in Los Angeles, says Los Angeles criminal defense attorney Lara Yeretsian.
"Now that he's been convicted in New York, the likelihood of conviction in LA is higher," Yeretsian said. Defense lawyers "don't have much to lose by fighting the charges, but they also can't go wrong by trying to negotiate a deal for less time on lower charges."
Lisa Linsky, a former sex-crimes prosecutor in New York, notes, "The two women involved in the Los Angeles County cases are also entitled to their day in court."
Still, Neama Rahmani, a former assistant U.S. attorney and co-founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers in Los Angeles, said based on his experience, "it takes a long time" to transfer someone in the custody of another jurisdiction, so don't expect to see a Weinstein trial in Los Angeles County immediately.
Moreover, a Los Angeles County trial would not necessarily be a slam dunk, says Laurie Levenson, law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "Jurors sometimes have wacky notions of what they consider double jeopardy," Levenson said. "They may think he's already gone through this, and with the same witnesses and the same credibility issues."
Another factor that could influence a Los Angeles trial is politics and pressure from MeToo activists and women's groups who want to see Weinstein die in prison, Rahmani said.
"The sentence also creates political considerations for (Lacey)," Rahmani said. "Weinstein's California victims certainly deserve their day in court, but it is questionable whether the time and expense of a second prosecution will result in any practical impact on (Weinstein). Given his advanced age and health issues, 23 years is likely a life sentence for (him)."
If there is a Los Angeles County trial, it would have a significant difference from the New York trial: California does not have a predatory sexual assault statute which requires prosecutors to prove a defendant assaulted more than one person to achieve a higher sentence if convicted.
To meet that burden in New York, "Sopranos" actress Annabella Sciorra testified that Weinstein raped her in her New York apartment 27 years ago. But the verdict indicated the jury didn't believe her beyond a reasonable doubt.
"Obviously the (Manhattan) district attorney overcharged and I think they had a false sense of confidence," Rahmani said. "But there is no such statute in California. Instead, if there is a conviction, a judge could sentence him to consecutive sentences for multiple counts" and achieve a similar lengthy sentence.
Levenson thinks the lack of a confusing predatory statute (the New York jury asked to have it explained again during deliberations) could be "a blessing in disguise" for the Los Angeles prosecutors.
"It's a problem to have witnesses talking about near-30-year-old events – it's too long ago for jurors to be confident in witnesses' recollections" beyond a reasonable doubt," Levenson said.
A key similarity likely in a Los Angeles trial would be testimony by prior bad acts witnesses or "witnesses to uncharged acts," as the California-based Allred calls them. These witnesses, whose allegations are either too old to prosecute or out of jurisdiction, are offered by prosecutors to bolster their case that the defendant engaged in a distinct pattern of criminal behavior.
In the New York trial, three such witnesses, including Young, were allowed by Judge James Burke to testify, after he first conducted a closed hearing in which he weighed the probative value of their testimony against their potential prejudicial damage.
Young's testimony was challenged at the New York trial by a Mexican actress, Claudia Salinas, whom Young accused of enabling Weinstein to assault her in the hotel bathroom. "It didn't happen," Salinas said on the stand.
It is not clear whether the jury believed their stories in addition to the two complaining witnesses, Miriam "Mimi" Haleyi and Jessica Mann, on which they convicted. Following the New York verdict, the New York Times interviewed three anonymous jurors who said they spent little time discussing the prior bad acts witnesses, but one juror said the similarities in what they described lent credibility to their accounts.
At a press conference in Los Angeles after the New York verdict, a group of Weinstein accusers hailed the New York verdict and some of them said they would like to be called as witnesses in Los Angeles.
But one thing a Los Angeles jury is unlikely to hear, at least in the courtroom, is the outcome of the New York trial, Levenson said.

Pandemic spawns 'infodemic' Surge of misinformation about outbreak stumps social media companies

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - First, there were conspiratorial whispers on social media that the coronavirus had been cooked up in a secret government lab in China. Then there were bogus medicines: gels, liquids and powders that immunized against the virus.
And then there were the false claims about governments and celebrities and racial unrest. Taiwan was covering up virus deaths, and the illness was spiraling out of control. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who now runs a philanthropic organization, was behind the spread of the virus. Italians were marching in the streets, accusing Chinese people of bringing the illness to their country. None of it was true.
As the coronavirus has spread across the world, so, too, has misinformation about it, despite an aggressive effort by social media companies to prevent its dissemination. Facebook, Google and Twitter said they were removing misinformation about the coronavirus as fast as they could find it, and were working with the World Health Organization and other government organizations to ensure that people got accurate information.
But a search by The New York Times found dozens of videos, photographs and written posts on each of the social media platforms that appeared to have slipped through the cracks. The posts were not limited to English. Many were originally in languages ranging from Hindi and Urdu to Hebrew and Farsi, reflecting the trajectory of the virus as it has traveled around the world.
Security researchers have even found that hackers were setting up threadbare websites that claimed to have information about the coronavirus. The sites were actually digital traps, aimed at stealing personal data or breaking into the devices of people who landed on them.
The spread of false and malicious content about the coronavirus has been a stark reminder of the uphill battle fought by researchers and internet companies. Even when the companies are determined to protect the truth, they are often outgunned and outwitted by the internet's liars and thieves.
There is so much inaccurate information about the virus, the WHO has said it was confronting a "infodemic."
"I see misinformation about the coronavirus everywhere. Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other people are spreading conspiracies," said Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
In Taiwan, virus-related misinformation on social media has fed concerns that China might be using the crisis to undermine the government of the self-ruling island.
In recent weeks, there have been posts on Facebook and other sites claiming that Taiwan has concealed large numbers of coronavirus infections. There have been fake but official-looking documents promising giveaways of face masks and vaccines. A screen capture from a television news broadcast was doctored to say that President Tsai Ing-wen had contracted the disease and was in quarantine.
In a statement to The Times, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, blamed China's "internet armies" for the deluge of falsehoods.
The Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of China's territory, and Taiwanese officials have long accused Beijing of manipulating both traditional news media and social platforms to turn Taiwanese citizens against Tsai, who opposes closer ties with China.

Texto completo: Convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein has been sent to prison, but Rutgers University won't let go of his money.
Rutgers has decided to hold on to a $100,000 gift from the disgraced Hollywood mogul to help fund a campus feminist studies program despite his dual convictions of rape and sexual assault and his sentencing Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in lower Manhattan.
Weinstein, 67, was slammed with a 23-year prison sentence for raping an aspiring actress and forcibly performing oral sex on a female production assistant.
Weinstein's money is helping to pay for an endowed professorship named after feminist icon Gloria Steinem. His donation arrived at Rutgers just two months before his history of abusive behavior toward women was revealed in lengthy investigative reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker.
Rutgers at the time refused to send Weinstein's money back – or donate it to a charitable cause. Weinstein had not even been charged with any crimes yet.
But now, in the wake of Weinstein's conviction Feb. 24 in New York on charges of third-degree rape and first degree sexual assault against two women, that decision by Rutgers has resurfaced.
The verdicts followed a wrenching six-week trial that was considered a political and historical touchstone for the campaign to draw attention to sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinstein's conviction and likely prison sentence now begs this question: Why would any university use Weinstein's money to now fund studies in feminism?
In a statement Monday explaining why it was keeping the cash, Rutgers spokeswoman Dory Devlin pointed out that Weinstein was not the only donor. More than 425 people contributed $3 million to the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies.
Devlin, the senior director of Rutgers News & Media Relations, said Weinstein and his family's foundation contributed the $100,000 in August 2017 in honor of his late mother, "who shared Gloria Steinem's hopes for female equality."
Devlin added that Rutgers believes "that applying these funds to advance women's equality has been a good use of the donation."
She said the money "helped fund the endowed chair's efforts to teach, conduct research and immerse students in debate and scholarship on the relationships between media, politics, market forces and democracy."
In its statement, Rutgers did not comment on Weinstein's conviction — or the seeming contradiction of partially funding women's studies with money from a rapist. Also, neither Steinem nor the current Rutgers chair of feminist studies, Naomi Klein, responded to requests for comment.
Weinstein's possible prison sentence looms as yet another chapter in what has become known as the #MeToo movement.
In recent years, numerous women have come forward with accusations that led to the downfall of a wide variety of influential men, ranging from Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota to CBS executive Les Moonves and NBC's Matt Lauer.
Weinstein is considered the most notorious of the bunch, however. And his trial was viewed as one of the first legal tests of efforts to not only force sexual offenders from their jobs but to send them to jail.
In its presentencing letter to the judge, Weinstein's defense team wrote that he suffered a "historic" fall from grace as a result of the #MeToo movement.
Nearly 90 women in the film industry, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchette, Rosanna Arquette and Rose McGowanaccused Weinstein of some form of sexual misconduct or harassment.
Most of those incidents could not be cited in the New York trial, however. They either took place outside New York or were beyond the statute of limitations for crimes. Other incidents did not amount to crimes but were considered by prosecutors to be improper workplace harassment.
Weinstein's trial in New York focused on just two noncelebrity women — an aspiring actress and a production assistant for the TV show, "Project Runway."
The actress, Jessica Mann, said Weinstein raped her at a Manhattan hotel. The production assistant, Miriam Haley, said Weinstein forced her to let him perform oral sex on her.
But the women's testimony was complicated by the fact that each conceded they maintained cordial relationships with Weinstein after their assaults and even engaged in consensual sex with him. Mann, now 34, called Weinstein a "soulmate." Haley, 42, who is sometimes referred to as "Mimi Haleyi," admits she flirted with Weinstein.
In an attempt to show Weinstein's predatory style, Judge Burke allowed prosecutors to introduce testimony from four other women including Sopranos star Annabella Sciorra who said Weinstein raped her in the 1990s.
The prosecution's gamble failed. The jury of seven men and five women found Weinstein not guilty on the two most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, which could have resulted in a life sentence for him. Weinstein also was acquitted of first degree rape.
In an 11-page court filing last week calling for a lengthy prison sentence, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office resurrected its argument about Weinstein's history of alleged abusive behavior.
Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, in highlighting three dozen uncharged incidents, wrote that Weinstein carried on a "lifetime of abuse towards others, sexual and otherwise."
"Starting in the 1970s, he has trapped women into his exclusive control and assaulted or attempted to assault them," Illuzzi-Orbon said.
Weinstein faces another criminal trial in Los Angeles on charges that he raped one woman and sexually assaulted another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013. Law enforcement officials in Great Britain and Canada also are reportedly investigating Weinstein on sexual charges.
The accusations against Weinstein first emerged in October 2017 in reports in The New York Times and in The New Yorker. They coincided with a report two months earlier that Rutgers had accepted a gift of $100,000 from Weinstein for the Gloria Steinem chair.
Critics quickly demanded that Rutgers send the money back to Weinstein — or donate it to another charity. Rutgers refused, even though the University of Southern California turned down Weinstein's donation of $5 million to endow scholarships for women filmmakers.
At the time, Rutgers called the allegations against Weinstein "appalling and indefensible."
But it said "more work is needed to advance women's equality" and Weinstein's donation "will help those efforts."
"We think devoting these funds to advance women's equality," Rutgers said in a statement, "is a better use of the dollars than returning the donation to Harvey Weinstein and the H. Weinstein Family Foundation."

Texto completo: Women and presidential politics. I've spent more than 20 years thinking about women and politics; specifically focusing on one question: When will America elect a female president? So it is understandable that I'm feeling a bit glum as it becomes clear we will not elect Madam President in 2020.
Note that my work is nonpartisan. I keep my political views out of it. I write about the obstacles and the opportunities that women face as presidential contenders. It doesn't matter if they are Republicans or Democrats. It only matters that they are women, and as such they are seen through a gendered lens.
Some good news: In this presidential primary, we had more women running for president than we've ever had in the history of the United States. That's not nothing and, yet, presidential politics is winner take all and this time around it won't be "women take all."
Hillary Clinton's bids for the presidency both in 2008 and 2016 were the first time in United States history that a woman was not a symbolic presidential candidate. While 2016 was the only time a woman has been major party nominee in the United States, the 2020 candidate gender mix shows the United States is at the very least inching toward the necessary critical mass of candidates argued in early gender research as necessary for women to gain political parity.
Until the recent turn of events, it looked as though we may just keep building on the wo-mentum (if you will). And yet, alas, regardless of their resumes or rhetoric, the presidential prize remains elusive for each of the women who made presidential bids in 2020. Oh and that word: electability. Isn't it true that we don't know if anyone is electable until they get elected?
* Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the most feministic candidate
* Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the former prosecutor
* Marianne Williamson, who fervently asserted that love is the answer
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the winning, pragmatic worker bee whose record of sponsoring bills and getting the work done is impressive. She responded to her third-place finish in New Hampshire as though it was first place (I don't blame her - we have to celebrate every advance).
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the brilliant law professor-turned politician who often began her utterances with a drawn out "sooooooooo" as she attempted to make simple her intricate plans to strengthen the economy and the health care system.
As I gathered news clippings for my forthcoming book on women and presidential politics, Warren's file grew the largest. She was deftly organized so early, and seemed to have the best ground game full of young, smart aspiring politicos who checked and double-checked every point. But as the primary rolled on, even her notable debate performances could not make up for her lackluster showings. And when she failed to capture her own state of Massachusetts on Super Tuesday, her withdrawal from the race would be only a matter of time.
The youngest woman running, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a veteran of two tours of duty, has yet to bow out of the race, though she has long been unviable.
As a rhetorician, I write about what I see and hear from candidates, and it is challenging to ascertain just how much of the obstacles that these women faced on their presidential paths has been gendered. And yet, my early notes predict that we have less tolerance for "woman-splaining," or a woman never elected to anything before, or one whose major message is: Remember the women. Women struggle to gain acceptance as likable, competent leaders more than men do in United States presidential politics.
If this wasn't true, as Amy Klobuchar quipped, we'd be playing "Name your favorite woman president!" Alas, this is not likely to be a new app for your phone or a new board game.
But there's still hope.
Whichever 70-something white male nominee the Democratic party nominates, I'm holding out the hope that he will choose a female vice presidential candidate. We've only had two so far in the United States: Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin.
And the more I research and write about women and presidential politics, the more I'm convinced that vice could be nice, and the surest path to the Oval Office for Madam President.

Texto completo: Within a period of just 10 days, the Donald Trump election campaign filed libel lawsuits against The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN.
The Times was sued on Feb. 26, the Post on March 2 and CNN on March 6 for statements in opinion pieces published by the newspapers and posted on the CNN website that suggested Trump sought or welcomed Russia's intervention in the U.S. presidential election process.
The lawsuits claim the statements were false and defamatory (damaging to one's reputation).
Legal experts interviewed by news providers expect the lawsuits to be dismissed by the courts under the First Amendment guarantee of a free press. Two reasons were cited:
First, the courts grant wide latitude to opinions in the media about public matters. Second, a public figure must provide evidence the defendant knew a false statement was false or failed to check it out.
Fox News legal analyst Mercedes Colwin told MediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz the lawsuit against the Times is "DOA — dead on arrival" because the offending article is the writer's opinion.
Even if Colwin is correct, the lawsuits could still dampen negative commentary about Trump carried by smaller news outfits with limited resources to defend themselves.
"The Trump campaign is trying to send a message, both to the press and the public, that you criticize the president at your peril," Brian Hauss, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberty Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, told The Associated Press.
The piece in the Times was written by former Times executive editor Max Frankel.
A spokeswoman for the newspaper said the Trump campaign was trying "to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable."
A piece in the Post cited by the Trump campaign was by staff opinion writer Paul Waldman.
Fred Ryan, publisher of the newspaper, called the lawsuits "a shameful ploy designed to intimidate news organizations as they work to inform voters on the important issues at stake in this election."
The piece on cnn.com was by contributor Larry Noble, a former Federal Election Commission general counsel.
Brian Stelter, host of CNN's "Reliable Sources," called the lawsuits "publicity stunts."
Trump — who condemned the news media as "enemies of the people" — has threatened to take a close look at our country's libel laws. In January 2018, he said current libel laws are "a sham."
The AP noted that the Times, the Post and CNN have been frequent targets of Trump's Twitter attacks against the press At the AP's last count, the president had posted 191 tweets about CNN, 106 of which contained the word "fake."
The ACLU's Hauss told The Hill big news organizations "have the resources to hire excellent legal counsel who will demonstrate why these lawsuits are completely meritless."
He added: "But news publications or even individuals who who don't have access to these resources are very naturally going to think twice before saying something criticizing the president if they're worried that the president's campaign team is going to be filing even a meritless defamation lawsuit against them."
Not surprisingly, Jenna Ellis, senior legal adviser to the Trump campaign, has a different view.
"False statements are not protected under the U.S. Constitution," she said. "Therefore, these suits will have no chilling effect on freedom of the press."
I think she is wrong. That's an opinion, which I hope is protected by the First Amendment.

Texto completo: After being stuck in Atlanta for the night, the Knicks boarded a flight back to New York on Thursday afternoon. Like much of the NBA, they were unsure what was next.
Back in town, they deferred to the league to provide guidance about where they can go and what they can do. But in the long term, the entire NBA faces at least a 30-day hiatus after the decision Wednesday night to suspend the season after the first positive test for the coronavirus by a player.
On Wednesday, after a long day of discussing how to handle the pandemic, NBA commissioner Adam Silver was considering the options when Utah's Rudy Gobert tested positive, prompting Silver to cancel the game the Jazz were scheduled to begin minutes later against the Thunder in Oklahoma City. Moments later, Silver announced the suspension of the season.
After Jazz player Donovan Mitchell tested positive Thursday and another day of meetings took place, Silver set a hopeful but realistic tone.
Speaking on "NBA on TNT," he provided some hope that the season can resume in a month. But when asked if the season could be over, he said, "Of course it's possible. I just don't know more at this point."
As other leagues and college tournaments, most notably the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments, followed the example the NBA set, shutting down on Thursday, Silver pointed out that there is so much we don't know right now.
"I think we're at the point now that this has been declared a pandemic," he said. "And it's virtually impossible to contain it. It's going to be widespread and the NBA community is not immune and so it's going to spread throughout our community as well."
In a letter to fans, Silver said, "This remains a complicated and rapidly evolving situation that reminds us that we are all part of a broader society with a responsibility to look out for one another. That is what the NBA will continue to do, and we are grateful for your understanding and for being the best fans in sports.''
Silver said he had spent the two days in conference calls with the NBA's Board of Governors and consulting with experts including Vivek Murthy, the former Surgeon General of the United States. He said that even Wednesday, there was uncertainty about whether it would be necessary to empty the arenas as a public health matter.
"In the two full board meetings I had yesterday and today, not one team raised the issue of money," Silver said. "The entire discussion was about the safety and health of the players, the community around our teams. This hiatus will most likely be at least 30 days. We don't know enough to be more specific than that. Then the question becomes is there a protocol, with or without fans, to resume games."
That decision has been taken out of the NBA's hands in many places, including New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday morning that gatherings of more than 500 people would be banned for the foreseeable future. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio then declared a state of emergency and added that venues such as Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center could be vacant for as long as six months.
"The last 24 hours have been very, very sobering," de Blasio told reporters at a news conference. "Yesterday morning seems like a long time ago. We got a lot of information in the course of a day yesterday and a lot changed then, then last night it just seemed the world turned upside down in the course of just a few hours."
The Madison Square Garden Company said in a statement: "We support Governor Cuomo's decision and starting tomorrow night, our New York venues will only host events that adhere to the Governor's very clear parameters. This is a fluid situation and we will be back with further details when available."
NYCB Live's Nassau Coliseum said in a statement, "NYCB LIVE, home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, and their partners are following the Governor's call to restrict group gatherings amid COVID-19 concerns. The health and safety of our patrons and staff is our foremost priority."
The Knicks provided no updates on their status, but The New York Times' Marc Stein tweeted, "The NBA has notified its teams that all players are advised to stay in their home markets, remain home as much as possible and that teams are not allowed to hold group practices, meetings or workouts through at least March 16.
"The NBA, league sources say, has also asked team doctors and athletic trainers to check in at least once a day with players on their health status and use a "one player, one coach, one basket" rule if multiple players are working out at the same time in team practice facilities."
ESPN reported that in a team conference call, Lakers players were told they can conduct individual workouts at the team facility - but that the team would schedule the workouts so players do not come in contact with each other.
Cavs' Love giving $100G. The Cavaliers' Kevin Love is committing $100,000 toward helping arena workers in Cleveland impacted by the shutdown resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, The Associated Press reported.
Love, who has been very open about his struggles with anxiety, said he appreciates that the outbreak can be "extremely overwhelming" to people and that the suspension of the NBA season has caused a "sudden life shift" for workers at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, home of the Cavs.

The IRS Proves the Left's Favorite Economists Wrong

Texto completo: 'The Rich Really Do Pay Lower Taxes Than You" read a headline in the New York Times last fall. This astounding claim, presented in the media as fact and evidence of inequities baked into President Trump's 2017 tax cut, came from two economists at the University of California, Berkeley. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman asserted that 2018 was the first year in U.S. history that the average tax rate on the 400 wealthiest income earners dipped below the rates paid by the lower-middle class and poor.
Finally, we had proof the rich weren't paying their fair share. But new data from the Internal Revenue Service suggest it isn't true.
The Saez-Zucman analysis raised eyebrows among other economists who study tax data, in part because they claimed it reflected the first full year under the new tax rates. At the time they published their study, the IRS had yet to release the data necessary to make the calculations they described. Preliminary numbers for 2018 income-tax returns, covering all filings made by last year's Oct. 15 extended deadline, came out only last week. These data tell a very different story: America's wealthiest earners still carry the lion's share of the tax burden.
Closer inspection reveals that Messrs. Saez and Zucman imputed the tax rates they claim for 2018 from records that predated the Trump tax cut, and therefore didn't capture its effect on the measured distribution of income. They built in opaque assumptions that now appear to have exaggerated the tax cut's benefit to high-income earners.
This wasn't the only problem with the Saez-Zucman statistics. Their alleged 23% tax rate paid by the highest earners -- encompassing all federal, state and local taxes -- fell below the Congressional Budget Office's estimates for the top income percentile's federal tax rate alone. The two economists' tax rates for the poor also looked suspiciously high. A 25% rate for the lowest quintile of earners would be almost twice the level found in other estimates, including those using better-established data from the Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The discrepancy arose from Messrs. Saez and Zucman's exclusion of the earned-income tax credit for low-income households, artificially inflating the amount of tax the poor really pay.
The new IRS numbers now provide reason to doubt Messrs. Saez and Zucman's entire narrative of a regressive U.S. tax system designed to favor the rich at the expense of the poor. The IRS reports effective income-tax rates on the adjusted gross incomes of different groups of earners. That's the percentage of income that people actually pay to the government, as distinct from the statutory tax rate.
According to the IRS, the top 0.01% of earners -- those with incomes above $10 million -- paid a 24.8% effective federal income-tax rate in 2018. This isn't very different from the 25.3% the group paid in 2017, and is higher than the average rate of 22.5% on the same group during the George W. Bush administration. As these rates only encompass federal income taxes, most filers can expect to add another 8% to 12% of income from other forms of taxation, placing their total burden well above the Saez-Zucman numbers.
How does that affect the claims of regressivity? It's true the remainder of the top 1% (those with incomes between roughly $500,000 and $10 million) paid a slightly higher effective rate, at 26.5%, than the top 0.01% did. But tax rates drop rapidly from there, with filers in the $50,000 to $75,000 reporting bracket (approximately the median U.S. family income) facing an average federal income-tax rate of 8.4%.
People who earned between $15,000 and $40,000 paid an average federal rate of merely 4% of their adjusted gross incomes in 2018. And thanks to the earned-income tax credit and others like it, the poorest earners paid very little if any federal income tax at all.
In short, the federal income-tax structure still places the unambiguous bulk of its burden on the highest earners. The Trump tax cut hasn't changed that. In 2018, the top 1% of U.S. earners paid roughly 37% of all federal income taxes. The top 5% paid around 58%. This suggests that policy makers wishing to mitigate regressive features of the tax system should look elsewhere. State and local sales and property taxes may be a more promising area for reform.
The IRS's preliminary data also suggests that the needle on income inequality -- the motive force behind the Saez-Zucman research and the wealth-tax proposals it has been used to support -- hasn't moved lately. The share of adjusted gross income that went to the top 1% in 2018 was essentially the same as it was a decade earlier, at least going by the IRS numbers. The same is true of the top 0.1% and even the top 0.01%, the ultrarich so often targeted in political rhetoric from the left.
The full economic effects of the Trump tax cut extend beyond personal income-tax rates, and will be seen in the data only when future statistical releases become available. The corporate income-tax cut, for example, will likely prompt high earners to shift income from their personal returns to corporate returns, further lowering the measured income shares of the top 1%. Ironically, the reduction in the corporate tax rate could lead to a statistical reduction in income inequality.
In their rush to embrace a convenient political narrative last fall, much of the press and political classes never considered the possibility that the data would undermine their story. It did.

WEST LEBANON — As events around the area are canceled and people begin to self-quarantine due to concerns around COVID-19, many people say they are still unclear about what to do if they start feeling unwell.
Dartmouth-Hitchcock announced Thursday evening that it is seeing an uptick in patients sent directly to its emergency department for COVID-19 screening and testing — but in fact, D-H is asking patients and providers to take other steps first if a person does not need emergency care.
Patients’ symptoms
Initial symptoms of the virus can show up between two days and two weeks after exposure, and include a fever, shortness of breath and a cough, according to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s website. The virus can also cause fatigue and some gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea, according to The New York Times.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Vermont Department of Health say people who are concerned they may have the virus should not immediately go to the hospital. Instead, they should call their primary care provider right away for advice. People who don’t have health care providers can call the New Hampshire Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at 603-271-4496 or the Vermont Department of Health at 802-863-7240.
Dartmouth-Hitchcock patients “who are experiencing fever, cough, or shortness of breath or are concerned about potential exposure to COVID-19” should first call the D-H COVID-19 hotline at 603-650-1818 for screening and, if appropriate, scheduling testing, according to D-H.
Anyone with questions or concerns regarding the virus can also call 211 hotlines in both New Hampshire and Vermont.
Recommendations for providers
Dartmouth-Hitchcock advised providers against sending patients directly to the DHMC Emergency Department as a first step.
“If a patient does not exhibit signs that warrant an emergency department evaluation or immediate hospital admission, providers should ask the patient to don a mask and return to their home for self-quarantine and follow (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines pending further decisions on COVID-19 testing,” D-H announced Thursday evening.
Self-isolation
The best thing potentially infected or exposed people can do is start quarantining themselves at home, according to CDC recommendations. While at home, they should frequently wash their hands, limit contact with family members and pets, and clean household surfaces.
“It’s about limiting the impact on the community,” said Jenn Alford-Teaster, a senior research scientist at Geisel School of Medicine and former senior research support specialist at the New England Center for Emergency Preparedness. Alford-Teaster, who said she is not speaking on behalf of Dartmouth College, said 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, and that self-isolation is largely about protecting more vulnerable people.
At higher risk
People who have recently traveled to China, Italy, Iran, South Korea or Japan, or who have come in contact with someone who’s known to have the virus, are urged to call their Department of Health, according to a news release on Vermont’s Health Department website.
Anyone over the age of 60, or with underlying health conditions like cardiovascular disease, lung disease, asthma and diabetes, are at higher risk of catching the virus. The CDC says people at higher risk should call their doctor, avoid other people and crowds, wash their hands often and stay home when sick.
Many people will not get tested unless they have a recent history of travel or a known exposure to the case, University of Vermont Medical Center officials said in a press conference Thursday.
Worsening illness
For some who get sick, the illness may get more severe and could require hospitalization, but the CDC says a person should always call their provider before going into the hospital. Worsening conditions could include more difficulty breathing, bluish lips or face, pain or pressure in the chest, and confusion, according to the CDC.
Though there’s currently no approved antiviral medication for COVID-19, physicians treating more severe symptoms would first decide whether to test a patient and isolate them in the hospital for assessment, according to Dartmouth-Hitchcock’s website.

Texto completo: After a disastrous performance in his first debate with Walter Mondale, many in the media began to openly question the then-73-year-old Ronald Reagan's mental fitness.
Writing in The New York Times, James Reston pointed out that Reagan "got his figures mixed up, and didn't seem to be mentally alert in dealing with Mr. Mondale's arguments." The Wall Street Journal noted that "the president's rambling responses and occasional apparent confusion injected an unpredictable new element into the race" and pointed out that at age 75, "10 percent of people suffer from significant mental impairment - senile dementia, or senility." The networks ran montages of Reagan stumbling over his words and brought on doctors to discuss the effects of aging on mental capacity.
When the second debate came around, Reagan put the aging question to rest with his now-famous line: "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience." A decade later, Reagan announced to the world that he had Alzheimer's disease.
Joe Biden is 77, four years older than Reagan was during the 1984 campaign. If Biden is elected, he'll be older on the day he takes office than Reagan was on the day he left office. So yes, his mental fitness is a legitimate issue.
There is plenty of cause for concern. Biden recently announced "I think we can win back the House" and promised to ban the "AR-14." He mistook Super Tuesday for "Super Thursday," and forgot the words of the Declaration of Independence, saying "We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created, by the, you know, you know the thing." In South Carolina, he declared, "My name's Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate." On three occasions last month, Biden declared he was arrested trying to visit Nelson Mandela in prison - an incident his campaign later admitted never happened. He earlier described meeting a Navy captain in Afghanistan, but The Washington Post reported that "almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect." He claimed to have worked with Chinese leader "Deng Xiaoping" on the Paris Climate Accord (Deng died in 1997). He claimed during a debate that "150 million people have been killed (by guns) since 2007" (which would be nearly half the U.S. population). He said he met with Parkland victims while he was vice president, even though the shooting took place after he left office. He has declared that "poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids." He pledged to use biofuels to power "steamships." He repeatedly gets confused about what state he is in; called "Fox News Sunday" anchor Chris Wallace "Chuck"; said his late son Beau "was the attorney general of the United States"; and confused former British Prime Minister Theresa May with the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Any one of these gaffes in isolation would be nothing more than that. But taken together they raise questions about whether Biden has experienced a cognitive decline. Biden's defenders say this is unfair, and some have even suggested raising it is ageism. No, it's not. His socialist rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is 78 - almost a year older than Biden - yet no one is questioning his mental fitness. On Monday night, Sanders spent an hour at a Fox News town hall where he was challenged to defend his policies and answered in great detail and without any gaffes. Could Biden do the same?
Many of President Trump's critics have suggested that he suffers from cognitive impairment. Well, in 2018, Trump took a test designed to screen for dementia - the Montreal Cognitive Assessment - and the White House physician reported he received a perfect score. Will Biden submit to the same test?
Sanders took a subtle dig at Biden during the town hall, pointing out that while he speaks for 45 minutes to an hour at his campaign events, Biden recently spoke for seven minutes. The two will have their first mano-a-mano debate Sunday. How will Biden perform over the course of a two-hour discussion? Perhaps he will put concerns about his mental fitness to rest. This much is certain: Democrats are about to pick a man they hope will be the first octogenarian president in American history. It is fair to ask whether voters are choosing a candidate who's not up to the job.

Texto completo: The COVID-19 travel time bomb just blew up. A week ago, people were optimistic but still planning to travel. This week, more travelers are changing their plans.
Take Tim McVay and David Bush, of Shadyside. They had planned a trip to the Chianti region of Italy.
"Our friends from Norway had invited us to spend a week later in April in Tuscany with them in a lovely villa," Mr. Bush said.
They had rented a place on a vineyard but began to have concerns as the news changed.
"We delayed our decision until [Tuesday] morning because our hesitation was less about getting sick and more about being quarantined," Mr. Bush said.
They've canceled, joining the growing numbers of people choosing to stay home.
Travel adviser Christina O'Toole, with Avenue Two Travel in Sewickley, said the situation in the popular European destination caught a lot of would-be travelers' attention.
"A week ago, people became cautious with the news out of Italy," Ms. O'Toole said.
"Travelers wanted to know their options before they decided to cancel or postpone their trip," she added.
With problems on cruise ships, concerns about flights and travel rules changing - along with serious moves like all of Italy going into quarantine - options started to shrink.
The good news, Ms. O'Toole noted, is that the travel industry is trying to accommodate its patrons.
"This week, tour operators, cruise lines and airlines have adjusted their cancellation and change fees, and airlines are waiving change fees," she said, adding that cruise lines like Silversea allow cancellations with a full refund 30 days from the sailing date.
The changes are giving travelers and organizations time to make an educated decision.
The Carnegie Museums Travel Program has decided to cancel all of its planned trips through April.
"Our travelers are the most important part of our program," said Barbara Tucker, the director of the museums' travel program. The Carnegie takes groups of eight to as many as 18 depending on the trip.
"We will continue to evaluate the situation and are refunding our travelers," she added. "I have never seen anything like this in my 19 years with the Carnegie - it is unprecedented."
Talk to anyone who had travel plans - especially international plans - and they are either reconsidering, canceling or delaying, especially in light of the president's latest travel ban.
"We were planning on flying to Frankfurt, Germany, to eventually get to Strasbourg, France, and Baden-Baden, Germany," Michael Danek said.
He and his wife, Heather, both of the South Hills, are avid travelers and had planned this trip in October. Concerned about the current hyper-vigilance because of COVID-19, he contacted the local tourist board in Stuttgart, Germany, to see what they were doing.
"I received a couple of very professional emails, and I was satisfied with their precautions," he noted.
His wife works for the University of Pittsburgh, however, and the university asked faculty and students not to travel to France, Italy or Germany over spring break. That was the tipping point for the Daneks to start to change their travel plans.
"Delta had a couple of websites that explained the rules to rebook without a fee," he said. "They were pretty flexible, but the websites had a bunch of dead links and there was a 7.5-hour wait on the phone."
"This is exactly why you work with a trusted travel adviser," insisted Ms. O'Toole. "As travel advisers, we have been through it all - 9/11, SARS, Ebola, volcanic eruptions - and our main concern is always the health and safety of our clients."
The Daneks were not able to rebook to Frankfurt because of fine print requiring the same fare class to be available.
But Mr. Danek was able to take care of the rebooking via direct messages on Twitter with Delta customer service.
"Instead of 7.5 hours, it took 40 minutes beginning to end," he recalled. Their new plans will take them from Poland to London in May.
Mr. McVay and Mr. Bush may have canceled their visit to Italy, but they are still hoping to attend a wedding in Wiltshire, England, this summer.
"Hopefully, the situation will have been resolved," Mr. Bush said.
"If we cannot attend, you might get sick of seeing us in our new morning suits," he joked.

Texto completo: Milan, Italy. Daegu, South Korea. Qom, Iran. Many of the world's largest coronavirus outbreaks took root in and around well-traveled cities, but they have since grown to encompass entire countries.
Cases have spread across Italy's north and down to Rome, leading to a lockdown of the entire country. Iran's capital, where leaders dismissed the virus just two weeks ago, has seen thousands infected. And cases continue to surge across Europe.
The outbreaks are not all heading in the same direction. South Korea has managed to slow growth of new cases for now, through intensive testing and monitoring of infections. Italy, Iran and the United States are still reporting large numbers of new cases every day.
Official case totals are an imperfect method of judging the world's outbreaks. Every country has more cases than it has been able to detect through lab tests. And a shortage of testing kits in some countries, like Indonesia and the United States, along with a lack of public disclosure in others, like Egypt, means official reports are probably masking large outbreaks.
Here's the extent of some of the largest outbreaks in the world and information on how these countries are trying to slow the spread of the virus.
Italy
An outbreak in Lombardy has threatened the entire country.
With more than 15,000 confirmed cases, Italy has reported the largest outbreak outside of China. Italian authorities first put restrictions in place in the northern region of Lombardy, where the outbreak first accelerated, before moving on Monday to restrict the movement and end public gatherings for all 60 million citizens in the country. At least 1,000 people have died because of the virus.
On Wednesday, the government shut down basically all commercial activities, including bars and restaurants. Supermarkets, pharmacies and newsstands can remain open. All schools are closed until at least April 3. But Italy's nationwide lockdown, the first in Europe, is not a severe ban on movement like the one put in place in Wuhan, China. Italians are still able to move around for work, to buy groceries and other essentials, and for reasons having to do with health, child or senior care. Police checkpoints have been set up around the country, at which people are required to stop and fill out official forms explaining their movements.
The number of new cases in Italy had steadily increased for more than a week before dropping on Tuesday. On that day, though, there were still almost 1,000 new cases.
Italy is aggressively testing for the virus, which could help explain why its total confirmed cases are higher than some other countries in Europe. On Tuesday, more than 60,000 tests had been performed, more than twice as many tests than the United Kingdom had done.
"Today, the red zone is Italy," Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, told The New York Times. But in 10 days, he warned, it will be Madrid, Paris and Berlin. If Italy cannot show how to stop the virus, he said, "the red zone will be Europe."
South Korea
Infections have slowed after weeks of intense surveillance and testing.
In contrast to most other countries, South Korea's reports of new cases have begun to slow -- at least for now. Unlike other countries with major outbreaks, South Korea, with a population of 50 million, has not outright restricted the movement of its citizens and has instead focused on aggressively monitoring for infections. More than 7,800 cases and 66 deaths have been reported.
More than 235,000 people have been tested, and health officials carefully track down people who may have symptoms, testing more than 10,000 people each day. The government even opened drive-through testing centers. While health officials are battling smaller clusters of infections in other cities, much of the effort has focused on Daegu, the center of the outbreak, where many people were infected in a large church congregation.
Health officials also introduced aggressive public awareness campaigns, sending out mobile phone alerts to citizens whenever a new case is reported in their districts. Updates are provided on government websites and mobile apps as to how many people have been tested and where, along with brief sketches on each patient: their gender, how they became infected and where they are being treated, as well as which places they visited before testing positive.
Officials have advised against holding large gatherings, like outdoor rallies and religious services. Schools remain closed.
Iran
The true size of the rapidly expanding outbreak is unknown.
Two weeks ago, Iran's leaders denied the coronavirus epidemic would be a problem. Now, with the total number of cases standing at more than 10,000, and with more than 400 people dead, Iran is scrambling to control one of the worst outbreaks in the world.
The virus started in the holy city of Qom, where thousands of pilgrims from Iran and around the Middle East travel each day. Two days after the first deaths and cases of the virus were reported in Qom, Iran held parliamentary elections, which are widely believed to have been the cause of the virus spreading to other provinces.
The authorities failed to take protective measures at this early stage. But the problem became impossible to ignore after nearly three dozen Iranian government officials and members of parliament were infected, and a senior adviser to the supreme leader died.
Now, Friday prayers are canceled, and schools and universities are closed until mid-April. Government offices remain open, but employees must work reduced hours. For everyone else, officials are asking people to leave their homes only when necessary.
A severe shortage of testing kits in Iran means the spread of the virus is likely much higher than reported. One study projected a week ago that the true total of infections may have been more than 18,000, "and a week ago is eons when we are talking about an epidemic," said Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto doctor who is a co-author of that study.
Jason Horowitz contributed reporting from Rome, Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul and Farnaz Fassihi from Tehran.

Texto completo: LEISURE
Disney to Close Its Theme Parks in California
The Walt Disney Company said on Thursday that it would close the Disneyland resort in Anaheim for the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks, and just the fourth time in its 65-year history, because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure -- two adjoining, but separately ticketed theme parks -- will close on Saturday morning through the end of the month. Disney's hotels in Anaheim will remain open until Monday.
Disney noted that there had been no reported cases of the virus at the resort.
The company said it would continue to pay its employees while the resort is closed. Refunds will be given for hotel bookings during the closure period.
MEDIA
Networks Cancel Showcases
CBS and NBC both canceled their annual spring showcases for advertisers, known as upfronts, on Thursday because of fears surrounding the coronavirus.
At the star-studded events, which take place in mid-May and are among the biggest in the television industry, entertainment executives unveil their new upcoming television series and do their best to persuade advertising agencies to buy commercial time.
Both companies, along with others like Twitter, YouTube and Roku, said they would instead post video presentations online. WarnerMedia and Xandr, AT&T's advertising unit, said on Thursday that they would scrap their joint live event in May in favor of "a unique video experience." Cable outlets like Fox News and AMC Networks have also canceled events.
POLLS
Virus Panic and Partisanship
Most Americans are worried about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, with concern greatest among Democrats and independent voters, according to a nationwide poll conducted by the online research firm SurveyMonkey for The New York Times.
The partisan gap in attitudes in the survey, which was begun last week and completed on Sunday, may reflect Republicans' greater receptivity to President Trump's assurances that the economy remains strong and that the virus is under control in the United States.
Three-quarters of independents and more than eight in 10 Democrats said they worried that the virus outbreak would hurt the economy. Two-thirds of Republicans expressed similar concern.

Texto completo: After another strong showing by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Tuesday's primary contests, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced that he was staying in the race for president. But Mr. Sanders will need to do substantially better in the contests that remain to secure enough delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Here are some possible outcomes for the primaries, and what the candidates will have to do to reach them.
What if:
Biden keeps doing as well as he has
If Mr. Biden performs as well as he has in previous contests, he will secure the nomination by late April or early May, according to New York Times estimates of how the candidates might fare in upcoming primaries. These estimates are based on the support each candidate has received in primaries and caucuses since Super Tuesday. The results make Mr. Biden a favorite in nearly every remaining contest, at least if he maintains the approximately 20-point lead he holds in national polls. Mr. Biden's lead could be even greater: Our estimates do not assume who will get support from many of the delegates of candidates no longer in the race, though many are likely to back Mr. Biden after all but one withdrawn candidate with delegates endorsed him.
What would it take:
For Biden to lose his delegate majority
Mr. Biden could do about 12 percentage points worse than he has and still win a majority. If he fared any worse, Mr. Biden would fall short of a majority and risk a contested convention. This means Mr. Biden could lose a bit of the support he has gotten so far and still be on track for the nomination. He could still win a majority of delegates even if he loses big states where he's currently favored, like New York, Illinois and Arizona. However, Mr. Sanders has said that Mr. Biden should still be the nominee if he wins the most delegates, even if he falls short of a majority.
What would it take:
For Biden to lose his delegate lead
Mr. Sanders would need to perform about 17 percentage points better to receive a plurality of delegates. Mr. Sanders would need to win a majority of the vote share in all but a handful of the remaining states to secure a delegate plurality. Mr. Sanders has said that the candidate who receives the most delegates should be the nominee, even if they do not receive a majority, but other candidates disagree.
What would it take:
For Sanders to win a majority of delegates
Mr. Sanders would need to do about 21 percentage points better to win a majority. More than half of all delegates remain up for grabs, and Mr. Sanders has another opportunity to gain support nationwide during the one-on-one debate with Mr. Biden on Sunday. But Mr. Biden's momentum over the last two weeks will make his decisive lead difficult to overcome. Mr. Sanders would need to perform much better than he has so far to secure a majority of delegates before the convention.
Senator Bernie Sanders would have to do about 21 percentage points better to secure a majority of Democratic delegates. (PHOTOGRAPH BY HILARY SWIFT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: 'SHE PERSISTED, THE MUSICAL' AT THE LINDA GROSS THEATER (Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday, 10:30 a.m.; Thursday, 5:30 p.m.; through March 22) Yes, she persisted, "she" being Harriet Tubman, Sally Ride, Sonia Sotomayor, Florence Griffith Joyner or one of the other historic female figures onstage. Portrayed by actors, these trailblazers all appear in this production, which demonstrates how a woman's unrelenting determination can change lives -- and sometimes the world. (Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose persistence the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, famously criticized in 2017, is not featured here.) An adaptation of the children's book of the same title by Chelsea Clinton, "She Persisted" is set during a fourth-grade museum field trip that ultimately takes one of the students, Naomi (Amber Jaunai, above left, with Cynthia Nesbit as Griffith Joyner, and Heather Sawyer), on a journey into the past. Created by Adam Tobin and Deborah Wicks La Puma and presented by Atlantic for Kids, the children's division of the Atlantic Theater Company, the show "is an exuberant, time-traveling history lesson that instills confidence, too," Laura Collins-Hughes said in her review in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Rufus Sewell stars in an Agatha Christie adaptation on Amazon. And a coming-of-age drama debuts on Disney Plus.
What's Streaming
AGATHA CHRISTIE'S THE PALE HORSE Stream on Amazon. Fans of Rian Johnson's recent Agatha Christie-style, murder-mystery "Knives Out" can get a taste of the real thing in "The Pale Horse," a mini-series adaptation of Christie's novel of the same name. The series, which aired overseas earlier this year on BBC One, stars Rufus Sewell ( "The Man in the High Castle") as a man whose name is found on a note in a dead woman's shoe. That discovery thrusts him into the center of a mysterious string of deaths, which are the apparent product of witchcraft. But their actual cause may be even more sinister.
STARGIRL (2020) Stream on Disney Plus. For a novel adaptation that's more "who am I" than "whodunit," hold off on "The Pale Horse" and consider instead this coming-of-age drama, based on the Y.A. best seller by Jerry Spinelli. Directed by Julia Hart ("Fast Color"), "Stargirl" follows Leo (Graham Verchere), a teenager at a small-town Arizona high school who quits trying to fit in after the arrival of a new, freewheeling student, who goes by the name Stargirl (Grace VanderWaal). In his review for The New York Times, Jason Bailey wrote that "some of the story beats and character qualities (particularly those of the rather precious title character) have congealed into cliché." (The novel was published in 2000.) But Bailey added that Hart "is such an enchanting filmmaker, her storytelling style so warm and welcoming, that those concerns fade -- particularly in the picture's second half, as her characters' interactions and motivations become more complex."
LOST GIRLS (2020) Stream on Netflix. The documentarian Liz Garbus ("What Happened, Miss Simone?") makes her fiction-feature debut with "Lost Girls," a drama based on Robert Kolker's nonfiction book "Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery." Like the book, the movie revisits a string of unsolved murders on Long Island. It stars Amy Ryan as a mother who presses law enforcement to search for her missing daughter, a mission that conjures up questions of gender, power and social justice. The film is "serious, respectful, gravely melancholic," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "Yet anger best describes the movie's atmosphere, its overall mood and its authorial tone." Dargis called it "a sober chronicle of victimization and empowerment."
What's on TV
PORTALS TO HELL 9 p.m. on Travel Channel. "There's bones in here, guys," the TV personality Jack Osbourne says in the Season 2 premiere of this paranormal investigation series, which is hosted by Osbourne and the investigator Katrina Weidman. The episode finds that pair exploring an old, purportedly haunted jail in Paulding, Ohio. The building, they are told, is home to several spirits, including that of a murder victim from the mid-20th century. When Osbourne discovers bones in a neglected basement jail cell, he sounds a bit triumphant -- and a bit spooked.

Texto completo: More evidence has emerged that the Indian police took part in violence against Muslims or stood aside during fighting in the capital last month.
NEW DELHI -- Kaushar Ali, a house painter, was trying to get home when he ran into a battle.
Hindu and Muslim mobs were hurling rocks at each other, blocking a street he needed to cross to get to his children. Mr. Ali, who is Muslim, said that he turned to some police officers for help. That was his mistake.
The officers threw him onto the ground, he said, and cracked him on the head. They started beating him and several other Muslims. As the men lay bleeding, begging for mercy -- one of them died two days later from internal injuries -- the officers laughed, jabbed them with their sticks and made them sing the national anthem. That abuse, on Feb. 24, was captured on video.
"The police were toying with us," Mr. Ali said. He recalled them saying, "Even if we kill you, nothing will happen to us."
So far, they have been right.
India has suffered its worst sectarian bloodshed in years, in what many here see as the inevitable result of Hindu extremism that has flourished under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His party has embraced a militant brand of Hindu nationalism and its leaders have openly vilified Indian Muslims. In recent months Mr. Modi has presided over a raft of policies widely seen as anti-Muslim, such as erasing the statehood of what had been India's only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.
Now, more evidence is emerging that the Delhi police, who are under the direct command of Mr. Modi's government and have very few Muslim officers, concertedly moved against Muslims and at times actively helped the Hindu mobs that rampaged in New Delhi in late February, burning down Muslim homes and targeting Muslim families.
Several videos showed police officers beating and throwing rocks at Muslim protesters and waving on Hindu mobs to join them.
A police commander said that as the violence erupted -- at that point mostly by Hindu mobs -- officers in the affected areas were ordered to deposit their guns at the station houses. Several officers during the violence were later overheard by New York Times journalists yelling to one another that they had only sticks and that they needed guns to confront the growing mobs. Some researchers accuse the police force of deliberately putting too few officers on the streets, with inadequate firepower, as the violence morphed from clashes between rival protesters into targeted killings of Muslims.
Two thirds of the more than 50 people who were killed and have been identified were Muslim. Human rights activists are calling it an organized massacre.
Though India's population is 14 percent Muslim and New Delhi's is 13 percent, the total Muslim representation on the Delhi police force is less than 2 percent.
India's policing culture has long been brutal, biased, anti-minority and almost colonial in character, a holdover from the days of British rule when the police had no illusions of serving the public but were used to suppress a restive population.
But what seems to be different now, observers contend, is how profoundly India's law enforcement machinery has been politicized by the Bharatiya Janata Party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist governing bloc.
Police officials, especially in states controlled by Mr. Modi's party, have been highly selective in their targets, like a Muslim school principal in Karnataka who was jailed for more than two weeks on sedition charges after her students performed a play about a new immigration law that police officials said was critical of Mr. Modi.
Some judges have also seemed to be caught up -- or pushed out -- by a Hindu-nationalist wave.
A Delhi judge who expressed disbelief that the police had yet to investigate members of Mr. Modi's party who have been widely accused of instigating the recent violence in Delhi was taken off the case and transferred to another state. And at the same time that the Supreme Court has made a string of rulings in the government's favor, one of the judges, Arun Mishra, publicly praised Mr. Modi as a "visionary genius."
All of this is emboldening Hindu extremists on the street.
The religiously mixed and extremely crowded neighborhoods in northeastern Delhi that were on fire in late February have cooled. But some Hindu politicians continue to lead so-called peace marches, trotting out casualties of the violence with their heads wrapped in white medical tape, trying to upend the narrative and make Hindus seem like the victims, which is stoking more anti-Muslim hatred.
Some Muslims are leaving their neighborhoods, having lost all faith in the police. More than 1,000 have piled into a camp for internally displaced people that is rising on Delhi's outskirts.
Muslim leaders see the violence as a state-sanctioned campaign to teach them a lesson. After years of staying quiet as Hindu lynch mobs killed Muslims with impunity and Mr. Modi's government chipped away at their political power, India's Muslim population awoke in December and poured into the streets, along with many other Indians, to protest the new immigration law, which favors migrants belonging to every major religion in South Asia -- except for Muslims.
Mr. Modi's government, Muslim leaders say, is now trying to drive the whole community back into silence.
"There's a method to this madness," said Umar Khalid, a Muslim activist. "The government wants to bring the entire Muslim community to their knees, to beg for their lives and beg for their livelihoods."
"You can read it in their books," he said, referring to foundational texts by Hindu nationalists. "They believe India's Muslims should live in perpetual fear."
Mr. Modi has said little since the bloodshed erupted, except for a few anodyne tweets urging peace. Delhi police officials deny an anti-Muslim bias and said they "acted swiftly to control law and order," which both Muslims and Hindus in those neighborhoods have said was not true. The police responded "without favoring any person on religious lines or otherwise," according to a written reply to questions, provided by M.S. Randhawa, a police spokesman.
Police officials said that Mr. Ali and the other Muslim men were hurt by protesters and rescued by the police -- though videos clearly show them being hit by police officers. Police officials also pointed out that one officer was killed and more than 80 injured; videos show a huge crowd of Muslim protesters attacking outnumbered officers.
The violence in New Delhi fits a pattern, experts say, of chaos being allowed to rage for a few days -- with minorities being killed -- before the government brings it under control.
In 1984, under the Congress party, which often bills itself as representing the interests of minorities, the police in New Delhi stood back for several days as mobs massacred 3,000 Sikhs.
In 1993, again under a Congress government, riots swept Mumbai and hundreds of Muslims were killed.
In 2002 in Gujarat, when Mr. Modi was the state's chief minister, Hindu mobs massacred hundreds of Muslims. Mr. Modi was accused of complicity, though he was cleared by a court.
Several retired Indian police commanders said that the rule in quelling communal violence was to deploy maximum force and make many arrests, neither of which happened in Delhi.
Ajai Raj Sharma, a former commissioner, called the performance "unexplainable." "It can't be forgiven," he said.
When the violence started on Feb. 23 -- as Hindu men gathered to forcibly eject a peaceful Muslim protest near their neighborhood -- much of it became two-sided. By day's end, both Muslims and Hindus had been attacked, and dozens had been shot, apparently with small-bore homemade guns.
But by Feb. 25 the direction had changed. Hindu mobs fanned out and targeted Muslim families. Violence crackled in the air.
Police officers watched as mobs of Hindus, their foreheads marked by saffron stripes, prowled the streets with baseball bats and rusty bars, looking for Muslims to kill. The sky was filled with smoke. Muslim homes, shops and mosques were burned down.
When a reporter for The New York Times tried to speak to residents standing near police officers that day, a mob of men with darting eyes surrounded him and ripped the notebook out of his hands. When the reporter asked police officers for help, one said: "I can't. These young men are very volatile."
The home ministry, which controls Delhi's police force and is led by Amit Shah, one of the most combative Hindu nationalists in the B.J.P., has come under heavy criticism for the policing failures. Delhi police officials denied being instructed by the central government to go easy on the troublemakers. The home ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
On Thursday, during a debate in parliament, Mr. Shah vowed to bring the culprits to justice, "regardless of their caste, religion or political affiliations." He has defended the police and called the violence a conspiracy, saying investigators found links to the Islamic State. Many observers question how much, if at all, the Islamic State had anything to do with what unfolded.
And then there's the composition of the police. The Delhi force, numbering around 80,000, has fewer than 2,000 Muslim officers and just a handful of Muslim commanders, according to an analysis done in 2017 by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. Delhi police officials did not deny this, and Muslim leaders said that police behavior was biased across India.
"Indian police are extremely colonial and caste-ist," said Shahid Siddiqui, a former member of Parliament. Police behavior, he said, is always "more violent and aggressive toward the weak."
India's population is about 80 percent Hindu, and gangs of Hindus threatened Muslims in several Delhi neighborhoods to leave before the Hindu holiday Holi that was celebrated this week.
One Muslim woman, who goes by the name Baby, opened her door a few days ago to find 50 men outside with a notebook in their hands, listing the addresses of Muslims. She packed up. She may be leaving soon.
"O, Allah, why didn't you make me a Hindu?" she said, her voice quavering. "Is it my fault that I was born a Muslim?"
Shalini Venugopal contributed reporting.

Texto completo: For centuries, novelists and fiction writers have imagined what plagues and virus outbreaks could look like, and many readers are seeking these books out amid concerns about the coronavirus.
You're probably reading and hearing a lot about coronavirus -- the symptoms, its spread around the world, the calls for "social distancing."
If the constant news and updates are making you anxious, consider one of these novels or stories. You wouldn't be alone: Publishers are reporting booming sales for books whose fictional plots revolve around pandemics, including Albert Camus's "The Plague" and Ling Ma's "Severance." And while many of these books conjure an all-out apocalypse, you might find comfort in dipping into a fictional worst-case scenario -- and, with some of them, seeing how the characters make it out alive.
[ Looking for more information about other real-life epidemics? Here's an essential reading list . ]
'The Andromeda Strain,' by Michael Crichton
When an unknown microorganism reaches Piedmont, Ariz., all but a few of the town's residents die. What follows is a race by scientists to understand what it is and how to keep it from harming others. Our reviewer called this book, published in 1969, "a reading windfall -- compelling, memorable, superbly executed."
'Cold Storage,' by David Koepp
In his 2019 debut novel, Koepp, who wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of "Jurassic Park," describes the race to contain a zombielike fungus that hijacks the brains of its hosts. There's plenty of grossness here, though this is a classic thriller; our reviewer said Koepp "has a wicked sense of humor and his characters are so keenly, intelligently and even movingly drawn that they might have stepped out of a literary novel."
'The Companions,' by Katie Flynn
Katie Flynn's debut novel, "The Companions," grew out of her "unhealthy fascination with outbreaks." "The Companions," published earlier this month, takes place in a future California where citizens have been quarantined in the wake of a deadly virus. The borders have been shut down and survivors live under surveillance, sequestered in high-rise towers. In a surreal twist, the dead persist as sentient machines called "companions," devices that dying people upload their consciousnesses into. The narrative, which unfolds from the perspective of eight characters, wrestles with the question of what separates humans from intelligent machines.
'The End of October,' by Lawrence Wright
In his forthcoming novel, "The End of October" -- which will be published on April 28 -- The New Yorker writer Lawrence Wright describes the chaos that a global pandemic might unleash: hundreds of millions of deaths, hospitals and health care systems stretched to the breaking point, the collapse of governments and civil society. The novel's protagonist, a microbiologist and epidemiologist named Henry Parsons, is on the front lines of trying to slow the virus's spread and engineer a vaccine as the pandemic cripples countries around the world.
In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Wright said he was alarmed by the overlap between his fictional pandemic and the coronavirus outbreak. "When I read the accounts of the spread of this new disease, I feel like I'm reading chapters from my own book," he said. "I just hope it turns out better in real life than it does in the novel."
'The Masque of the Red Death,' by Edgar Allan Poe
In this 1842 short story, the "happy and dauntless and sagacious" Prince Prospero and a thousand of his nobles retreat to a walled abbey to escape the Red Death, a plague that kills its victims within an hour. When Prospero holds a masquerade ball in seven different colored rooms of the abbey, he and his court find a figure donning blood-splattered robes and Red Death symptoms making his way through each of the rooms.
'The Passage,' by Justin Cronin
In this 2010 novel, the human race is nearly obliterated when a failed government experiment produces a mass of hungry vampires, or "virals," into the world. Years later, fewer than 100 humans remain, and the light source that keeps the virals at bay is on its last legs. Hoping to find power for their batteries, several survivors venture into a world they barely know anymore to figure out how to survive. This book, according to our reviewer, is "astutely plotted and imaginative enough to satisfy the most bloodthirsty reader."
'The Plague,' by Albert Camus
In this 1947 classic, a disease spreads through an Algerian town under quarantine. Interpretations of "The Plague" over the years have ranged from a critique of the Nazi occupation during World War II to a leading example of existentialist literature. It is one of several books about pandemics whose global sales have spiked as the coronavirus has spread.
'The Stand,' by Stephen King
In King's 1,200-page novel, a computer error at a lab doing biological warfare research leads to the release of an influenza strain that kills over 99 percent of the world's population. Survivors -- both good and evil ones -- converge and attempt to set up governments, but they soon realize that "the reality of a democracy no longer exists: 'The President is dead, the Pentagon is for rent, nobody is debating anything in the House or the Senate except maybe for the termites and the cockroaches."' What follows, our reviewer writes, is "a nation exposed over and over to itself, as in an enormous mirror, part trite situation comedy, part science fiction, part cop show."
'Station Eleven,' by Emily St. John Mandel
A pandemic has wiped out most of the global population, and it brings about a near-total societal collapse. Twenty years later, the world is practically unrecognizable, with borders and countries dissolved. Kirsten, the central character, is part of a troupe that travels among the remaining towns scattered across North America, performing mostly Shakespeare, to keep spirits afloat. Our reviewer said this 2014 novel "offers comfort and hope to those who believe, or want to believe, that doomsday can be survived."
'Severance,' by Ling Ma
Shen Fever has broken out in New York: Families evacuate, scores of people fall ill and life all but stops. But Candace, the heroine of this 2018 debut novel, remains, part of a small group of healthy workers; when she's not working, she posts her photographs of the eerily empty city under an online pseudonym. Alongside the horror, the book interweaves a critique of capitalism while evoking "a first-generation immigrant's nostalgia for New York," our reviewer writes.
'Zone One,' by Colson Whitehead
A plague has turned most of humankind into zombies, or "skels," short for skeletons. The ones who survived are trying to regain control of their cities, aided by sweepers like Mark Spitz (not his real name) who search for straggler skels and put them out of their undead misery. Written by Colson Whitehead before he won the Pulitzer and National Book Award for "The Underground Railroad," this 2011 book is literary, gory and, according to our reviewer, "for all its ludic violence, strangely tender."

Photograph Sales are booming, publishers say, for books whose fictional plots revolve around pandemics, including Albert Camus's "The Plague" and Ling Ma's "Severance." Readers are dipping into worst-case scenarios -- and, maybe, hoping to see how some of the characters make it out alive.

Previews & Openings

'THE FRE' at the Flea Theater (in previews; opens on March 15). Having brought a dancing-penis kickline to Broadway, Taylor Mac has now sunk low. In this new work, set in and around a mud pit, a young aesthete tries to persuade his grubby hedonists to de-ooze. In this show, directed by Niegel Smith, "audiences will literally and figuratively jump into the mud," the theater warns.
212-226-0051, theflea.org
'GNIT' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (in previews; opens on March 19). Henrik Ibsen's fairy tale of man's search for self -- plus trolls -- arrives in a new, modern-day adaptation from the existentially oriented playwright Will Eno. In this Theater for a New Audience production, Jordan Bellow, Joe Curnutte, Crystal Dickinson, Deborah Hedwall, Matthew Maher and Erin Wilhelmi star. Oliver Butler directs.
866-811-4111, tfana.org
'LUNCH BUNCH' at 122CC (previews start on March 18; opens on March 29). Sarah Einspanier's compassionate comedy, about public defenders, their midday meals and what we owe to ourselves and one another, comes back for seconds. The Play Company revives this Summerworks show, directed by Tara Ahmadinejad with a cast that includes the original players Ugo Chukwu, Keilly McQuail and Julia Sirna-Frest.
866-811-4111, playco.org
'NOLLYWOOD DREAMS' at the Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater (previews start on March 19; opens on April 13). Jocelyn Bioh, an actress and playwright who has a wicked way with comedy, premieres a new play. In Lagos, Nigeria, in the 1990s, Ayamma (Sandra Okuboyejo), a travel agent, fantasizes about becoming a leading lady in that country's burgeoning film industry. Then she gets the chance. Saheem Ali directs for MCC.

Last Chance
'ANATOMY OF A SUICIDE' at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (closes on March 15). Alice Birch's play, dazzling in its form and devastating in its effect, ends its Off Broadway run. With dizzying simultaneity, the play follows three generations of women (Carla Gugino, Celeste Arias, Gabby Beans) in the throes of suicidal depression. Lileana Blain-Cruz directs.
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'EMOJILAND: THE MUSICAL' at the Duke on 42nd Street (closes on March 19). Get your sad faces ready as this symbolist musical by Keith Harrison and Laura Schein shuts down. A romantic comedy set inside a smartphone and starring Lesli Margherita and Lucas Steele, it was described by Laura Collins-Hughes as "the kind of sheer fun that sends you back into the world feeling a little more upbeat."
646-223-3010, emojiland.com
'SHE PERSISTED' at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (closes on March 22). This Atlantic for Kids musical about women who changed history sings its final anthems. Adapted by Adam Tobin and Deborah Wicks La Puma from Chelsea Clinton's best-selling children's book, the show, Laura Collins-Hughes wrote, "cleverly conveys positive values." She added, "This is bouncy fun with a serious streak."

KIDS FLEADH AT THE CRAIC FEST at Cinépolis Chelsea (March 14, 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m.). As St. Patrick's Day approaches, you can expect an influx of all things Irish, including, in this case, some unfamiliar vocabulary. "Fleadh" means a festive occasion, and "craic" is slang for fun, and children will find both at this movie theater on Saturday. Part of the larger Craic Fest of Irish music and cinema, the Kids Fleadh, for ages 5 to 12, presents award-winning short films by Irish and Irish-American directors. They include animated projects like Damien O'Connor's "Anya," the hopeful journey of a Russian orphan; Louise Bagnall's "Late Afternoon," which explores an elderly woman's memories; and Mark C. Smith's "Two Balloons," a comedy starring lemurs that fly dirigibles. The event will also offer storytelling, Irish step dancing and a post-screening reception.

'ROSIE REVERE, ENGINEER, & FRIENDS' at the Borough of Manhattan Community College Tribeca Performing Arts Center (March 14, 11 a.m.). If the name Rosie Revere reminds you of Rosie the Riveter, it's no accident. In the fictional world of the children's author Andrea Beaty, little Rosie Revere is the great-niece of the spirited woman whose can-do attitude symbolized female industriousness during World War II. In this musical from the estimable TheaterWorksUSA, the contemporary Rosie, whose engineering goals are based on her great-aunt's dreams, joins two other protagonists from Beaty's books: Iggy Peck, who longs to be an architect, and Ada Twist, who has her sights set on science. Created by Lauren Gunderson, Brian Lowdermilk and Kait Kerrigan, this musical adaptation celebrates inquisitiveness and ingenuity while also highlighting the wonders of science, technology and math.

'SHE PERSISTED, THE MUSICAL' at the Linda Gross Theater (March 14-15 and 17, 10:30 a.m.; March 19, 5:30 p.m.; through March 22). Yes, she persisted, "she" being Harriet Tubman, Sally Ride, Sonia Sotomayor, Florence Griffith Joyner or one of the other historic female figures onstage. Portrayed by actors, these trailblazers all appear in this production, which demonstrates how a woman's unrelenting determination can change lives -- and sometimes the world. (Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose persistence the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, famously criticized in 2017, is not featured here.) An adaptation of the children's book of the same title by Chelsea Clinton, "She Persisted" is set during a fourth-grade museum field trip that ultimately takes Naomi, one of the students, on a journey into the past. Created by Adam Tobin and Deborah Wicks La Puma and presented by Atlantic for Kids, the children's division of the Atlantic Theater Company, the show "is an exuberant, time-traveling history lesson that instills confidence, too," Laura Collins-Hughes said in her review in The New York Times.

Texto completo: In an effort to raise the influence of female political leaders and female voters, the meeting aims to pressure the Democratic Party to place greater focus on issues faced by American women.
WASHINGTON -- A coalition of the country's most prominent women's advocacy groups will host a meeting of top female organizers, activists and officials on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in July, part of an effort to raise the influence of female political leaders and voters who make up the backbone of the party.
The hosts of the event include diverse organizations, including abortion rights groups like Naral Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, political groups that foster the participation of women of color in politics and Emily's List, one of the country's oldest organizations funding women in politics.
The meeting is the first such event scheduled around a national party convention, say the organizers, and aims to pressure the party to place greater focus on issues affecting American women, including equal pay, sexual harassment, paid family leave, access to abortion, birth control and child care.
Female voters, activists and candidates have powered the Democratic Party's gains during the Trump era, both running for office and voting for the party in record numbers in recent years. Yet, a female candidate failed to crack the top echelons of the presidential race. Only one of the six women running in the primaries remained a viable contender until Super Tuesday. None of the female candidates won a single state.
They also could not count on backing from female voters. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out last week, ranked third among female voters in Super Tuesday contests, losing to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders by more than 10 percentage points.
The losses of major female candidates has sparked an aggressive push for a woman on the ticket as vice president, as well as a robust discussion within some quarters of the party over how to better support female candidates at the highest levels.
"It felt important to do something that brought women's groups together," said Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion rights organization Naral Pro-Choice America, a host of the event. "We're all coming to grips with the fact that there is some deep-seated stuff we have to deal with as a country in order to not just elect a woman but create policy that is centered around women."
A record number of women serve in Congress, yet female candidates still struggle to win more executive posts like governor or president. Republican women face an even larger gender gap: Of the 37 women who won House seats in 2018, only two were Republicans.
"Voters are still somewhat reluctant to see women in executive posts, and the challenge is both a likability competition and a competence component," said Gov. Kate Brown, the first female governor of Oregon elected in more than two decades.
For black, Asian, Native American and Latino women, some of the most reliably Democratic voters, the numbers are even starker: Forty-seven of the 127 women serving in Congress in 2020 are women of color. The decision by Senator Kamala Harris of California to drop out of the race before the first round of voting sparked a wave of frustration from some black female activists and politicians over their political standing in Democratic politics.
"Democrats need women of color, plain and simple. They need our votes, organizing, strategic insight and energy to mobilize voters to win in November," said Aimee Allison, president of She the People, a political advocacy organization for women of color. "Now it's time for the nominee and the entire Democratic establishment to back our leadership if they want to win."
Leaders of the organizations hosting the summit say they also wanted to send a message to the party as reproductive rights issues make their way to a majority conservative Supreme Court.
Last week, the court heard its first sustained arguments over abortion since President Trump's appointments of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh shifted the court to the right. Next month, the justices will take up whether the Trump administration may allow employers to limit women's access to free birth control under the Affordable Care Act.
While the organizers are planning for an in-person summit, they are exploring options for a virtual gathering should the spread of the coronavirus force the cancellation of events around the national convention. So far, officials at the Democratic National Committee, which is scheduled to take place from July 13 to 16 in Milwaukee, say there are no plans to reschedule the convention or move the proceedings online.
Ms. Hogue said the organizers were not planning a similar effort around the G.O.P. convention, arguing that the Republicans have little interest in issues of gender equality.
"We used to do that," she said. "But now, we've just given up the ghost."

Texto completo: His works often caught passers-by unawares. One was so lifelike that, after 9/11, firefighters are said to have tried to rescue it.
J. Seward Johnson Jr., a sculptor who may be responsible for more double takes than anyone in history thanks to his countless lifelike creations in public places -- a businessman in downtown Manhattan, surfers at a Florida beach, a student eating a sandwich on a curb in Princeton, N.J. -- died on Tuesday at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 89.
His family said through a spokesman that the cause was cancer.
Mr. Johnson had another distinction besides his art. As a member of the family that founded Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical and consumer products giant, he was one of six siblings who, in a high-profile court case in the 1980s, sought to overturn his father's will, which left his vast fortune to a former maid, Barbara Piasecka Johnson, whom the senior Mr. Johnson had married late in life. A settlement was reached just before the case went to the jury, giving the children a share of the estate but leaving most of it to Mrs. Johnson.
But more enduring were the sculptures, which often caught passers-by unawares; many would pause for a closer look and, in the cellphone age, a picture. One sculpture in particular became something more than a curiosity. It was a work Mr. Johnson called "Double Check": a seated businessman reviewing the contents of his briefcase.
The sculpture was in Liberty Park near the World Trade Center when the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, left the area in ruins. Many other artworks in the buildings and outside were destroyed that day, but the man with the briefcase, though knocked off his perch, survived, covered in debris.
The sculpture is so lifelike that firefighters are said to have tried to rescue it. It became a makeshift memorial -- a symbol of endurance to some, a reminder of the bodies never recovered to others. In 2006 it was installed in the newly named Zuccotti Park, not far from its original spot.
"I thought of him as a businessman Everyman -- with his briefcase -- getting ready for his next appointment, and people identified with him," Mr. Johnson told The New York Times in 2005. "So when he survived, it was as if he was one of them -- surviving as well."
John Seward Johnson Jr. was born on April 16, 1930, in New Brunswick, N.J. His father was the son of one of the founders of Johnson & Johnson. His mother, Ruth Dill Johnson, was a native of Bermuda whose father had been Bermuda's attorney general.
Mr. Johnson, by his own admission a poor student, was sent to the Forman School in Litchfield, Conn.
"It was a place for dyslexics," he told The Times in 2002, "although we weren't called that then."
He tried college at the University of Maine, where he studied poultry husbandry. ("It was the only thing they'd let me into," he said.) Then, in 1951, he joined the Navy.
After leaving the Navy in 1955 he took a management job in the family company, but a troubled first marriage, to Barbara Kline, proved distracting. He is said to have hired private detectives to raid his own house in the middle of the night hoping to catch her in an indiscretion; she was alone, thought the detectives were intruders and shot one of them, injuring him.
Soon after their divorce in 1964, Mr. Johnson married Cecelia Joyce Horton, who got him interested in art. Sometimes they would paint together, although he wasn't very good at it.
"I didn't like what I could do with paint," he told The Times, "so my wife suggested sculpture because I had some mechanical ability."
He took some classes and made his first piece, in stainless steel. It won a contest sponsored by U.S. Steel.
"I thought, oh gee, this is great, maybe sculpture isn't so bad after all," Mr. Johnson told the newspaper U.S. 1 in 2002. "I never won anything after that."
In 1974 Mr. Johnson established the Johnson Atelier in Hamilton, N.J., a sculpture school and foundry where artisans helped fabricate his sculptures as well as those of other artists, including George Segal and Joel Shapiro. The foundry operated until 2004.
In 1984 Mr. Johnson created Grounds for Sculpture, a 42-acre sculpture park on a former fairground in Hamilton. Some of Mr. Johnson's trompe l'oeil works are there, surprising visitors as they wander the property, but much of the work is by others, with abstract and other genres well represented.
"Seward is the artist that everybody loves to hate," David Levy, director of the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, said in 2005, a reference to those who dismiss his work as kitsch. "But quietly and selflessly, he is an enormously important citizen of art."
Not all of Mr. Johnson's sculptures are as realistic as "Double Check" or "Out to Lunch," the sandwich eater on the curb in Princeton.
One of his best-known works is "The Awakening," a 15-foot-high depiction of a giant struggling to emerge from the earth. For years it was at Hains Point in Washington, though about a decade ago it was moved to Prince George's County in Maryland. Another well-known piece, which exists in several versions, is "Unconditional Surrender," a 25-foot-high re-creation of the famous V-J Day photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square.
Mr. Johnson also made a series of works called "Beyond the Frame," three-dimensional translations of 18th- and 19th-century paintings by Manet, Renoir and others. An exhibition of those works at the Corcoran in 2003 did not impress Blake Gopnik, who reviewed the show for The Washington Post.
"Bad art is made every day, by tens and hundreds of thousands of well-meaning people," he wrote, "and this is just more of the same. It's not shameful; it just happens to be hideous and dumb."
Mr. Johnson seemed unbothered that the art world sometimes dismissed his work.
"Most people who like my work are timid about their own sense of art," he told The Times. "I love to draw it out of them, because they have strong inner feelings. They've been intimidated by the art world."
In addition to his wife, Mr. Johnson is survived by a son, John Seward Johnson III; a daughter, India Blake; and five grandchildren.
Several other Johnson works are part of the landscape of Princeton besides "Out to Lunch," which is in Palmer Square in the center of town. There is, for instance, "The Newspaper Reader," near Trinity Church. A seated man -- Mr. Johnson envisioned him as a conservative fellow, as evidenced by his tie and wingtips -- is reading The Times. Mr. Johnson cast the newspaper pages from mats used by the newspaper in the printing process.
The issue in the man's hands is dated March 22, 1974. But on the bench beside him is the newspaper of Aug. 9, 1974. You've probably seen it: Its lead headline, in gigantic type, says, "Nixon Resigns."
In a 1975 interview, Mr. Johnson said he had already completed the metalwork when that news broke; he felt he had to add the August newspaper to the scene as a nod to history.

Re "Closing Schools May Not Help," by Jennifer Nuzzo (Op-Ed, March 11):
As a first-grade teacher, I find it unwise to determine at this juncture that schools can remain open during the coronavirus crisis. Over the last few weeks, we have stepped up surface cleaning, started hand sanitizing as students enter the classroom and practiced hand washing technique.
Meanwhile, I'm still constantly reminding students to remove their hands from mouths, noses and one another. Six- and 7-year-olds do not practice social distancing. It's laughable to imagine a primary classroom with students placed six feet apart.
The best news we've had since the outbreak is that children seem to tolerate the virus without serious illness. However, many of my students live with grandparents, or routinely interact with them as caregivers and chauffeurs.
Communities and districts need plans for providing meals and care for their students in need, should schools close. They also need plans for providing access to devices and internet for distance-learning purposes.
This pandemic is the first time we've had to grapple with the logistics of large-scale school closings, and we are not prepared.

Texto completo: Readers see a lack of compassion and leadership and speculate about why Britain was excluded from a travel ban. Also: School closings in a pandemic; a failed effort in West Africa.
To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Limits Travel After W.H.O. Cites Pandemic" (front page, March 12):
Even if we allow for the factual mistakes President Trump made in his speech Wednesday night, the most devastating takeaway was that the man read from a teleprompter without emotion. He did not appear to relate to or empathize with the American people.
Americans craved a little compassion and reassurance from their leader. They did not need to hear that it was a "foreign virus."
Mr. Trump is incapable of compassion. Too bad for our Republic.
Merritt H. Cohen
East Hanover, N.J.
To the Editor:
Is the exemption of Britain from the travel ban due to President Trump's admiration for Boris Johnson, his support for Brexit or, most important, his business ventures -- i.e., hotels and golf course in Scotland and ties to British banks? Coronavirus will not be stopped from crossing the English Channel, and therefore the reason has to be embedded in the president's self-interest and wedded to his animosity toward the European Union.
Gilbert Whisnant
Jamestown, N.C.
To the Editor:
Surely the most overworked phrase of the week is "out of an abundance of caution." While the president exhorts the public to "Just stay calm. It will go away," schools are closing, events are being canceled and businesses are asking employees to work remotely "out of an abundance of caution."
This only serves to spotlight the absence of strong leadership and preparation from the Trump administration and the dearth of reliable information from our public health agencies, forcing community, business and school officials to make their own public health decisions. While the president peddles falsehoods about the availability of tests and misstates the details of his own policies in an Oval Office address, the rest of the country is piecing together the advice of local officials and the actual public health experts who have managed to make their voices heard.
We're trying to do the best for students and employees, making up best practices as we go along -- out of an abundance of caution.
Randy Brett
New York
To the Editor:
Re "Talks Underway on Stimulus Plan to Weather Virus" (front page, March 11):
The proposal by the Trump administration to stimulate the economy by reducing the payroll tax may appear, at first blush, to be well intentioned. But the payroll tax is the funding mechanism for Social Security and Medicare. I suspect that this proposal is nothing more than another attempt by Republicans to chip away at these programs. If the administration is truly interested in assisting workers who are disadvantaged by the coronavirus outbreak, there surely are better ways to achieve that end.
Terry Freedman
Sandy Springs, Ga.
To the Editor:
Re "Twitter Pulpit Is No Match for Viral Foe" (news analysis, front page, March 9):
Despite a lifetime of morally, ethically and legally questionable activities, President Trump has escaped mostly unscathed. He has survived numerous scandals, as well as national and international crises of his own making, not to mention the Mueller probe and, of course, impeachment. Could it be that this self-proclaimed germophobe, the Teflon Don, will finally be brought down by his avowed archenemy, a lowly virus?

The Military Failure in West Africa
To the Editor:
"U.S. Sends a Mixed Message in a Region Bloodied by Terrorism" (news article, Feb. 29), while reporting concerns about prospective U.S. troop cuts in the Sahelian region of West Africa, didn't take account of the failure of military policies there since 2013.
In Mali, where an officer who received U.S. anti-terrorist training led a coup triggering ethnic and jihadist insurrections, about 20,000 U.N. peacekeeping and French regional forces have succeeded only in dispersing armed groups over a wider area.
U.S. training of corrupt and abusive Sahelian militaries and logistical and drone assistance to France's counterinsurgency operations have unintentionally provoked and facilitated rebel and government killings of civilians.
Policymakers who view these insurrections through simplistic, charged labels like "terrorism" and "Islamic State and Qaeda affiliates" miss the local political energy behind them. At their core lies the absence of public services and protection, ethnic discrimination, corrupt and repressive militaries and a lack of economic opportunities for young people.
These insurrections will not be quelled until Sahelian governments are obliged (and helped) to undertake political and economic reforms instead of depending on illusory foreign military saviors.

#MeToo overreach is real

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault conviction, and the 23-year prison sentence imposed Wednesday, have been hailed as a vindication of the #MeToo movement unleashed by the Hollywood mogul's downfall more than two years ago.
No doubt, achieving more accountability for high-status sexual predators and empowering women to speak out about abuse are a #MeToo gain. But those who rightfully celebrate Weinstein's punishment should not ignore evidence that #MeToo has also brought forth more troubling episodes - ones in which those accused of wrongdoing have had to contend with seemingly insurmountable presumptions of guilt and vague, subjective definitions of sexual misconduct.
Although Weinstein is the emblematic #MeToo perpetrator - a man who coerced unwilling women through intimidation, manipulation and sometimes force - other men have taken a fall over far more ambiguous allegations.
Take a January story by Kelefa Sanneh in the New Yorker - the magazine that played a major role in Weinstein's undoing - about the travails of Pinegrove, an independent rock group struggling to recover from its lead singer's #MeToo problem.
In November 2017, Evan Stephens Hall agreed to take a one-year hiatus and seek therapy after a crew member who had toured with the band accused him of "sexual coercion." The charge stemmed from a brief relationship the accuser eventually came to see as damaging (partly, perhaps, because it led to a breakup with her previous boyfriend) and, in the magazine's words, "implicitly manipulative." The woman acknowledged that Hall wielded no power over her - the band had an unstructured, egalitarian atmosphere and was not a source of steady income - but said that "in the bubble of tour, I really felt like he did." For his part, Hall "believed we were mutually in love," as he said in a statement on Facebook, but apologized for being blind to his "inherent privilege" as a man and a "recognized performer." Remarkably, after 2,700 words, the New Yorker article asked: "Is this enough?"
Or consider the professional repercussions suffered by Jack Smith IV, formerly a journalist for the progressive website Mic. A September 2018 story by Julianne Escobedo Shepherd, editor in chief of the feminist Website Jezebel, about taking #MeToo into "gray areas," vilified Smith based on accounts from a "whisper network" of five women with whom he had sexual relationships, none of whom worked with him at Mic but all of whom, according to Jezebel, accused Smith of "emotional abuse, manipulation, and gaslighting." Apart from one allegation of nonconsensual choking during sex, which Smith denied, their claims discussed "coercive" sex and "emotional manipulation" such as alternating between affection and aloofness or hostility. A Mic investigation sparked by one of the women's earlier allegations on social media had cleared Smith of impropriety at work. Nonetheless, he was fired hours after the article was posted because of what Mic's executive news director called "multiple, disturbing allegations."
Very quickly after #MeToo emerged, the movement's focus expanded from abuse of power in the workplace to a wider terrain of male misbehavior. But what does "misbehavior" mean? Human interaction, intimate or professional, is often a tangled web. People routinely revise their memories, especially when a romance or friendship sours - and when the personal becomes political. In a cultural moment that urges the reexamination of male-female dynamics through the lens of patriarchal oppression, a messy relationship can easily be reframed as one-sidedly abusive, and a reciprocal flirtation with a colleague can be recast as reluctantly tolerated sexual harassment.
Disturbingly, even some accused men who are exonerated can remain in #MeToo's shadow. In 2018, writer Junot Diaz was accused of nonconsensually kissing a female writer and misogynistic verbal aggression toward two other female writers at events. One allegation of verbal abuse was undercut by an audio recording. Although Diaz responded to the first accusation with a statement saying that "I take responsibility for my past" and emphasizing the need to "continue to teach all men about consent and boundaries," he later specifically denied the kissing allegation. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston Review conducted investigations and decided not to cut professional ties with Diaz. These decisions were met with a social media outcry. "A month after accusations of sexual misconduct, Junot Díaz is more or less unscathed," one headline said, as though the writer had gotten away with bad acts. Sales of his books fell 85 percent in seven months, the New York Times reported in an article on #MeToo fallout in classrooms.
It's impossible to tell how common unjust allegations and "gray area" cases are, especially since injustice and ambiguity are also, to a large extent, in the eye of the beholder. But the #MeToo movement has succeeded largely on the power of personal stories, and there are certainly enough compelling personal stories to suggest that #MeToo overreach is real. It can ruin careers and lives, and it tarnishes the movement's positive accomplishments.

Texto completo: In the span of just a few weeks, the top editors of two leading digital-news outfits called it quits. Ben Smith, who ran BuzzFeed News for eight years, took a job writing a column at the New York Times; Lydia Polgreen is leaving HuffPost to oversee a podcast company.
Two does not make a trend, but it does raise a question: Do their departures - smack in the middle of the busiest news cycle in years - say something about the troubled state of the digital news media?
Both editors answer with a firm no. They say their decisions were personal, not an extension of some larger industry malaise. Nevertheless, it's impossible not to notice the context.
HuffPost and BuzzFeed were once the shooting stars of the new-media galaxy, innovators that showed "legacy" media organizations how news could be edited and packaged for the young and digitally savvy. The former pioneered high-volume commentary, almost entirely liberal, and eventually coupled it with some first-class reporting, becoming one of the first digital-only news organizations to win a Pulitzer Prize. The latter began as a purveyor of "listicles," quizzes and other clickbaity content but under Smith developed into a newsroom that broke several important stories but also famously flopped in its reporting about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of President Trump.
These days, however, the sky no longer seems the limit, not just for BuzzFeed and HuffPost but for the entire field of digital-news sites that had once seemed to be journalism's future.
Digital publishers face the same issues that have beset, and decimated, whole swaths of the traditional media, particularly local newspapers. Digital ad rates have fallen steadily for years amid an unending supply of competitors and slow-growing demand from sponsors. Looming over the entire business are the twin colossi, Facebook and Google, which collect about 60 percent of every dollar spent by digital advertisers.
Video streaming, once thought to be a savior, turned out to be a high-cost investment with mixed returns. And few digital publishers have been able to convert their visitors into regular subscribers, which seem to be a key to long-term financial stability.
The result has been a pullback by venture capital firms that once showered start-up dollars on the likes of BuzzFeed, Vice, Vox, Business Insider and other digi-news ingenues. There's also been shrinkage within: Over a few days in January last year, BuzzFeed, AOL, Yahoo and HuffPost - the latter three all owned by Verizon Media - collectively laid off more than a thousand employees. Smaller sites, such as Mic, Refinery29, the Outline and PopSugar, have sought financial stability by selling to larger sites.
None of the major digital players has undergone as radical a transformation as HuffPost did under Polgreen. The site once emphasized "user-generated content" - a hodgepodge of political opinion and personal essays by celebrities, quasi-celebrities and random writers. Polgreen, a former editor at the New York Times, moved HuffPost toward more original journalism.
The upshot has been that far fewer people now visit HuffPost, although those who do stay longer - the kind of increased "engagement" that advertisers like. Figures compiled by the ComScore tracking firm show that HuffPost's monthly traffic plunged by nearly half, from 66.5 million in January 2018 to 34.9 million in January while the time-per-visit grew from 8.8 minutes to 11.3 minutes, a 28 percent increase. (HuffPost disputes the January 2020 number, which would also mark an unusual drop from ComScore's records of HuffPost's traffic through the final months of 2019.)
What this means for HuffPost's overall financial condition is unclear. Verizon Media said it doesn't comment on its financial performance; Polgreen herself said the answer is a bit of a mystery.
"I wouldn't even know how to answer that," she said in an interview. "I've asked that question myself."
Polgreen, who is joining the podcast company Gimlet Media as head of content, said it's a fluke that she and Smith departed their companies around the same time and that neither departure tells a larger story. "This [new job] was just an opportunity that sparked my imagination," she said.
Smith, in a brief interview, made a similar comment, saying his decision to leave BuzzFeed was "very much a personal choice." He said he wanted to return to writing, though he didn't explain why he couldn't do so at BuzzFeed. He said he remains "optimistic" about the company's future.
Yet Smith himself hinted at the trouble underlying the digital-news sector in his first column for the New York Times, in which he noted that the Times had regained its financial footing at a time when others are struggling.
Smith wrote that the Times has poached "many of the [digital journalists] who once threatened it," including the former top editors of sites such as Gawker, Recode, Quartz and now BuzzFeed. The newspaper has also stocked its newsroom with star journalists from another digital start-up, Politico, where Smith himself used to work, including White House correspondent Maggie Haberman and political reporter Jonathan Martin.
More ominously, he quoted Josh Tyrangiel, a former senior vice president at Vice, as describing the gulf between the Times and other publications as a "moat . . . so wide that I can't see anyone getting into it. There's no new thing coming."
Smith's former boss, BuzzFeed chief executive Jonah Peretti, says his company turned a profit in the second half of last year, and is on track to make 2020 its first full-year profit since 2013. "We're in a better spot than we've ever been," he said. "The past two to three years were tough, but now we're on the other side of it. Ben left us in good shape."
But others won't be so lucky, Peretti thinks, as the eager venture money of years past evaporates. "The smaller companies need to find a home with the bigger companies in the digital-media space," he said. "There could be more consolidation in this industry. We're fortunate to be at a scale where we can stand alone. We're able to operate without having to consolidate."
Even so, the digital survivors "are unlikely to turn into the high-margin businesses that newspapers once were," said Jim Brady, the chief executive of Spirited Media, which formerly operated local-news sites in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Denver.
Brady, the former executive editor of washingtonpost.com, says there's a simple reason for Smith and Polgreen's abdications.
"Running digital news sites are grueling jobs," he says. "You're running 24/7. Huffpo and BuzzFeed are constantly under the microscope. You're managing huge staffs. And you have to be active participants in discussions about the business."
He added, "We're at the point where anyone running a site covering this election needs to either buckle up and get ready for the ride or get out of the car now so that there's time to get someone new in place and up to speed."

The U.S. is imitating the wrong Korea

Texto completo: The outbreak of an epidemic is something like a natural disaster - a spontaneous, accidental eruption that is no one's fault. But that does not mean we can do little about it and just wait for it to run its deadly course. The evidence is now clear: The spread of the virus can be greatly reduced if governments act early, aggressively and intelligently. Unfortunately, that does not describe the response of the U.S. government to the coronavirus pandemic.
We can track the speed of the outbreak since January, by which time the virus had spread from China to other countries. In South Korea, after an initial spike, the number of new cases has slowed. Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan - despite lots of travelers from China - have kept numbers low from the beginning. In the United States, however, we are seeing accelerating increases.
What did the successful countries do that seems to have worked? They began testing early and often. They coupled these tests with careful quarantines of those infected and tracking of where they had been, to better predict where the next outbreaks might occur. The public health systems had surge capacity because funding had been adequate. And authorities largely communicated simple, clear and consistent messages to the public.
One new study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, argues that without enhanced detection and restrictions on movement, the number of cases in China could have been 67 times higher by the end of February. And had China started acting just one week earlier, there could have been 66 percent fewer cases.
"Who would have thought we would even be having [this crisis]?" President Trump said last week. In fact, the director for medical and biodefense preparedness policy of his own National Security Council gave a speech in Atlanta in 2018 saying, "The threat of pandemic flu is our number one health security concern. We know that it cannot be stopped at the border." The day after she made this speech, the White House eliminated her unit. (Hat tip to "The Daily" podcast from the New York Times.)
Trump did make one very good decision - to ban most travelers from China from entering the United States, on Jan. 31. That bought the United States time. Alas, that time was wasted as testing turned into a fiasco.
If this were a war, the generals in charge of this operation would have been relieved of their command. Just one comparison: South Korea has tested more than 230,000 potential cases with a population of about 50 million. In the United States, this would be about 1.5 million. In fact, the United States has conducted about 10,000 tests in public health labs (and more in private labs). Per capita, the United States has tested far fewer people than most other advanced countries.
Trump's most recent, dramatic move - the travel ban on most of Europe - is symbolic of the administration's actions. The thousands of Americans currently in Europe are apparently exempt, as are a small number of others. More importantly, the disease is already in the United States and spreading. The policy was so poorly thought through that amendments, corrections and reversals were made to the president's speech within minutes of his having delivered it.
This crisis seems to have been designed to bring out the worst in Trump. The president doesn't like or trust experts, often explaining that he knows more than they do. He has bluffed and fibbed his way through much of his life and thinks nothing of doing so again - except this time we are not charmed or amused by the bluster but rather frightened.
In most global crises, the United States takes the lead and provides comfort and assurances to the world. In this one, Trump has been mostly AWOL. When he does appear, it is to blame the disease on foreigners and announce policies that are designed to reinforce that view. The broad collapse in global markets is surely in part a reaction to the vast vacuum of leadership in the White House.
Trump views everything from the narcissistic prism of his ego. He dismisses opposing views and insists that even the senior-most members of his administration repeatedly praise him and his leadership at all times. Watching the heads of America's leading science agencies prefacing their statements with ritual praise for the "dear leader" has been depressing.
Come to think of it, the Trump administration has been copying the wrong Korea. Instead of the intelligence and expertise of South Korea, it is emulating the sycophancy, incompetence and propaganda of North Korea.

Texto completo: Making it clear on coronavirus

As COVID-19 spreads throughout the world, the language surrounding the disease continues to evolve. This glossary defines the commonly used phrases present in news coverage and conversations.

Community spread

Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected, according to the CDC. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading infectious disease expert on the federal Coronavirus Task Force, said Tuesday that Florida was one of the states where community spread is occurring.

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Quarantine vs. isolation

These two terms have been used interchangeably during the COVID-19 outbreak, but there is a clear difference.

Isolation separates people who are sick with a contagious disease from those who are not sick.

Quarantine is the compulsory separation and restricted movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease. People who are well are quarantined to see if an illness develops and can last until people no longer pose a risk to others.

Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Conference of State Legislatures

Mild cases vs. severe or critical cases

According to WHO, 80 percent of cases are mild.

The New York Times defined mild cases as those involving lung infection, but mild to no signs of pneumonia.

The next level, severe cases, included lung issues like shortness of breath and low blood oxygen saturation.

Critical cases (the most serious level) can involve septic shock, organ dysfunction or respiratory failure.

Sources: World Health Organization and the New York Times

Outbreak vs. epidemic vs. pandemic

An outbreak is the sudden rise in the number of cases of a disease.

An epidemic occurs when an infectious disease spreads rapidly to many people.

A pandemic is defined by WHO as the worldwide spread of a new disease. Pandemics can often be caused by viruses that are new or have not been spread in a long time.

WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic Wednesday.

Source: Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology and the World Health Organization

Presumptive positive case vs. confirmed case

If an individual tests presumptively positive, it means at least one respiratory specimen was tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 at a state or local laboratory.

Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive at a CDC laboratory.

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Social distancing

Social distancing is a term that includes staying out of crowded public spaces, from shopping centers to stadiums. This includes cancelling large gatherings and avoiding events. Other examples of social distancing include working from home and switching from in-person lectures to online classes, as universities around the country have done.

The WHO recommends staying at least three feet away from individuals who are sneezing or coughing. This is because the virus is spread through droplets from the nose or mouth. The CDCs definition recommends staying about six feet of away from others when possible.

Met Museum to Close Due to Coronavirus, Leaving the Met Gala’s Fate Uncertain

Texto completo: On Thursday, in the wake of a flurry of event cancellations and museum closings in response to the spreading coronavirus, yet another famous institution was added to the list: the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced around lunchtime that its flagship location on Fifth Avenue, the Met Breuer and the Cloisters will be closed beginning Friday, March 13 in order to contain the spread of the virus. The museums have not yet announced firm dates upon which they can be expected to reopen. Additionally, on the same day, it was announced that effective immediately, the Metropolitan Opera has canceled all performances and rehearsals through March 31. New York Times reporter Michael Cooper also tweeted that Carnegie Hall had been closed.
“While we don’t have any confirmed cases connected to the museum, we believe that we must do all that we can to ensure a safe and healthy environment for our community, which at this time calls for us to minimize gatherings while maintaining the cleanest environment possible,” Daniel Weiss, the president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said in a statement to the New York Times .
Throughout this worldwide mess, a lot of people have been wondering whether the Met Gala, the annual fashion and celebrity extravaganza that takes place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will still be taking place. This year’s event, which revolves around the theme “About Time: Fashion and Duration,” is still a go to commence on the first Monday in May, according to Nancy Chilton, the chief external relations officer of the Met’s Costume Institute. “We are proceeding as planned and look forward to a wonderful evening,” Chilton told The Cut on March 10. “We will of course continue to keep a close eye on the situation,” she added, referring to the coronavirus.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Harvey Weinstein was sentenced Wednesday to 23 years in prison after breaking his courtroom silence with a rambling plea for mercy in which he professed to be "totally confused" by the #MeToo movement that spelled the Hollywood producer's downfall.
His accusers - those who testified against him and many others who have spoken out elsewhere against the former Hollywood mogul - hailed the near-maximum punishment for his rape and criminal sex act convictions as long overdue.
The 67-year-old Weinstein, who arrived at the courthouse Wednesday in a wheelchair and used a walker throughout the trial after recent back surgeries, could spend the rest of his life behind bars.
He was convicted last month of raping a once-aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on former TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi at his apartment in 2006. He faced a minimum of five years and a maximum of 29 years in prison.
The conviction marked the first criminal fallout from a raft of allegations that the Oscar-winning movie producer used his clout to lure women, sexually assault or harass them and then silence them.
"Although this is a first conviction, this is not a first offense," Judge James Burke said in imposing the sentence.
Weinstein, who did not testify during the trial, addressed his accusers, saying, "To all the women who testified, we may have different truths, but I have great remorse for all of you." But he also argued that men are being accused of "things that none of us understood."
"Thousands of men are losing due process. I'm worried about this country," he said in a calm but creaking voice. "I'm totally confused. I think men are confused about these issues."
Both of the women Weinstein was convicted of assaulting told the court about the damage he did to them, and the empowerment they felt when testifying against him.
"Rape is not just one moment of penetration. It is forever," said the 2013 rape accuser, who recalled a moment during the trial when she left the witness stand in tears and then could be heard screaming from an adjacent room.
It was, she said, "the day my voice came back to its full power," she said.
Asked later about her reaction after the sentence, she wiped her eyes, raised her arm and nodded her head.
Haleyi broke down in tears as she told the court the 2006 attack scarred her deeply and "stripped me of my dignity as a woman." The encounter made her rethink her career in the entertainment business and left her feeling afraid of retaliation, she said.
The Associated Press typically does not name people, without their consent, who say they were sexually assaulted. It is withholding the rape accuser's name because it is not clear whether she wishes to be identified.
Weinstein, who has maintained that any sexual activity was consensual, showed no reaction to the sentence.
In his address to the court, he touched on his past charitable fund-raising, his filmmaking career and a pledge that his new "mission is to help people." He said his "empathy has grown" since his downfall.
Years of whispers about Weinstein's behavior burst into public view in The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017. In the aftermath, more than 90 women, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Salma Hayek and other actresses, publicly accused Weinstein of sexual assault and sexual harassment. The takedown energized the #MeToo movement for speaking up about sexual assault.
Time's Up, an organization created in the wake of #MeToo, on Wednesday hailed the women who testified against him for "the impact that they have had on our culture at large."
Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno bristled at his sentence, saying the judge and jury had "caved" in a #MeToo and media atmosphere where Weinstein "really never had a fair shake from day one."
"We were looking for fairness, and we didn't get it," Rotunno said.
Weinstein's lawyers sought a five-year sentence - the shortest possible in the case - citing his age and frail health.
Prosecutors said the man once celebrated as a titan of Hollywood deserved a harsh sentence that would account for decades of alleged wrongdoing.
The sentence "puts sexual predators and abusive partners in all segments of society on notice," said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.
Weinstein was convicted on two counts: criminal sex act and rape in the third degree. He was acquitted of the more serious charges against him of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault.
Now that Weinstein has been sentenced, his lawyers can move forward with a promised appeal. He also faces rape and sexual assault charges in California, where Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey tweeted Wednesday that her office was working on extraditing him. No arraignment date has yet been set.

Texto completo: And then there were two. The inflated field of Democratic presidential contenders that crowded debate stages and gasped for attention just a few months ago has collapsed like an undercooked soufflé. But the two Democrats remaining (three, if you count Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, but let's not) can still benefit from the solid policy work of the 20-something other campaigns, both in the march to November and in a hoped-for new administration. Before they fade in memory, here is a selection of proposals from several worthy also-rans.
■ Elizabeth Warren Amid the Massachusetts senator's blizzard of specific plans for health care and the economy, one proposal didn't get the traction it deserved: Warren's “ Blue New Deal " for the world's exploited oceans. This rescue plan for 71 percent of the earth's surface would build climate-ready fisheries, restore coastal wetlands that absorb five times as much carbon as forests, reduce pesticide and fertilizer use near water sources, and end offshore oil drilling. You've heard of Mother Earth. Time to meet Sister Ocean.
■ Kamala Harris The former California attorney general and current US senator placed bail reform at the center of her criminal justice agenda. Although the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits excessive bail for pre-trial defendants, some 450,000 people — who haven't yet been convicted of a crime, remember — are sitting in jails today because they are too poor to make bail. Harris filed a bill with Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky that would encourage states to develop alternatives to cash bail, a step toward fundamental fairness that incidentally would reduce needless spending of taxpayer dollars now used to warehouse defendants.
■ Pete Buttigieg The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., raised a seemingly obscure issue when he called for full, permanent funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund , a pool of royalties from federal offshore leases (not taxpayer dollars) intended to protect the nation's natural resources. The fund receives nearly $1 billion a year, but the full amount is rarely appropriated, as Congress siphons off millions for other pet projects. Since it was enacted in 1964, the fund has protected public lands from the Grand Canyon to the Minuteman bikeway. Spending the full $1 billion as it was intended is a debt about 56 years overdue.
■ Michael Bennet The former superintendent of the Denver public schools, now US senator from Colorado , knows something about the relationship between poverty and education. His anti-poverty plan included universal preschool for all three- and four-year-olds, so that children arrive at kindergarten ready to learn. The Democratic debate has focused disproportionately on billionaires, but Bennet was one of the few who awakened voters to the plight of those on the other end of the economic spectrum: the poor.
■ Julián Castro The former HUD secretary had a robust plan to relieve a housing affordability crisis in which 38 million Americans pay more than 30 percent of their incomes to keep a roof over their heads. He proposed an innovative renters' tax credit , refunding whatever a tenant pays over that 30 percent. (Castro would limit the subsidy to families making between 50 and 100 percent of an area's median income.) Massachusetts has something similar in the income tax deduction renters are allowed as part of the property-tax-reducing Proposition 2-1/2, but it is capped at $3,000, and a tax credit is more direct.
■ Amy Klobuchar The Minnesota senator's prescription for election security is deceptively simple: Mandate paper ballots . A bill she sponsored, the Election Security Act, would give $1 billion in grants to state and local governments to replace voting machines, hire IT staff, and conduct audits. It would require backup paper ballots in all 50 states, a no-brainer that nevertheless seems to tax the brains of Senate Republicans, who have repeatedly blocked the measure as too expensive.
■ Andrew Yang By contrast, Yang had a dreadful idea for election reform: institute voting by mobile app using (whoa!) blockchain. But his signature plan, for universal basic income is worth trying, if only on a pilot basis. Stockton, Calif., has been doing just this since 2019, offering $500 debit cards each month to a target group of 125 low-income residents. The effect of the experiment on hunger, family stability, and other factors is still being evaluated, but given that 40 percent of Americans can't absorb a single $400 emergency, a little cash could go a long way toward economic security.
Floating these kinds of creative solutions are the best part of political campaigns. The candidates may be gone, but their ideas should not be forgotten.

Word of the Week: 'Problematic'

Texto completo: If you are older than I am, you will think it is trivial when I say there was a time when we didn’t constantly call things “problematic.” If you are younger, you will think it’s unthinkable. I loathe this word. Its wretched, bastard children, “problematize” and (shudder) “problematization,” are maybe even more popular today, because words that come into common usage for reasons of pure ideological fashion inevitably mutate and then pass out of it for the same reasons. The real, presumptuous purpose of a word such as “problematic” is more like a threat than an argument. It is not employed to try to convince you that there is some particular problem you should be concerned with, but to remind you that there is a consensus against saying something.
“Problematic” wasn’t the harbinger of these words that are used to end arguments without further discussion. Before that, we talked about whether it was “OK” to say things and called things we wanted to suppress “not OK.” “Is It O.K. to Joke About Occupy Now?” asked the headline of a 2012 New York Times piece that answered it was not. (How about now, I wonder?) And before that, there was, of course, “offensive.”
The question raised in each case is “So what if it is?” Why shouldn’t we talk around problems, and offense, and the not-OK parts of life? Are we all one another’s therapists? We are not, but two very depressing examples from the past week have convinced me that picture of ourselves remains the default for too many people. First: WNYC, the public radio station for what is supposed to be the most bohemian and sophisticated city in the world, is running the following warning over archived recordings of old radio programs: “This episode is from the WNYC archives. It may contain language which is no longer politically or socially appropriate.”

Second: The darkly comic lyricist and cult favorite rocker Nick Cave responded to a listener comment on his newsletter from a fan, who asks: “Do you ever feel the need to change lyrics, when performing live, which may be problematic in 2020, for example, ‘A fag in a whalebone corset dragging his d--- across my cheek?’” Cave’s reply says it better than I can hope to, and it's worth quoting at length:
“What songwriter could have predicted thirty years ago that the future would lose its sense of humour, its sense of playfulness, its sense of context, nuance and irony, and fall into the hands of a perpetually pissed off coterie of pearl-clutchers? How were we to know?

Perhaps we writers should have been more careful with our words — I can own this, and I may even agree — however, we should never blame the songs themselves. Songs are divinely constituted organisms. They have their own integrity. As flawed as they may be, the souls of the songs must be protected at all costs. They must be allowed to exist in all their aberrant horror, unmolested by these strident advocates of the innocuous, even if just as some indication that the world has moved toward a better, fairer and more sensitive place. If punishment must be administered, punish the creators, not the songs. We can handle it. I would rather be remembered for writing something that was discomforting or offensive, than to be forgotten for writing something bloodless and bland.”
Indeed.

Ivanka Trump to headline New York fundraiser even as events canceled due to coronavirus

Texto completo: Ivanka Trump will headline a reelection event for her father in New York next month, following recent announcements of Trump campaign cancellations.
The invitation comes as events were called off this week in Colorado, Nevada, and Wisconsin due to the coronavirus outbreak. A three-day “Women for Trump” bus tour with the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump and other senior campaign surrogates was also suspended. As of Thursday, New York City had 62 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with a state of emergency declared statewide.
The April 1 event will also feature campaign manager Brad Parscale, senior campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, and RNC co-Chairman Tommy Hicks Jr.
The evening event bookends a two-day stretch that includes lunch events in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Naples, Florida, all with Ivanka Trump as a special guest.
Trump’s increased participation is a departure from her more quiet role in the last general election cycle.
Trump claimed in an interview with the New York Times this month she could outraise former Vice President Joe Biden, recounting an event where she raised $2 million in one 45-minute sitting.
The Trump campaign, the RNC, and joint fundraising committees pulled in a combined $86 million in February, or a little less than $3 million a day, a jump from the $60 million they raised in January. The RNC has added more than 2.5 million new donors since Trump’s election.
A former registered Democrat, the president’s eldest daughter is a heralded surrogate for President Trump.
She is viewed, along with her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, as a moderating force within the family. She has also advocated for paid family leave, ending human trafficking, and boosting female business owners.
The campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: The head of the New York Times’s much-hyped 1619 Project concedes she got it wrong when she reported that “one of the primary reasons” the colonists revolted against England was to preserve the institution of slavery.

Journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones claims now that she meant to say “some of” the colonists fought to preserve slavery, not all of them.

The admission comes seven months after her faulty assertion first appeared in the New York Times’s package of essays arguing that America’s founding is defined by chattel slavery. The admission also comes after Hannah-Jones mocked and debased the many academics who directed mild and good-faith criticisms at her bogus statement.

And, yes, the New York Times reporter admitting she got it wrong comes only after a 1619 Project fact-checker published an op-ed revealing she explicitly advised the paper against printing the erroneous claim that the American Revolution was fought primarily to preserve slavery.

It cannot be stressed enough that Hannah-Jones’s since-corrected version of historical events was key to the entire project, the premise of which is that America was founded upon, built upon, and primarily formed by slavery.

But, hey, better late than never!

“Yesterday,” Hannah-Jones tweeted, “we made an important clarification to my #1619Project essay abt the colonists' motivations during the American Revolution. In attempting to summarize and streamline, journalists can sometimes lose important context and nuance. I did that here.”

In her original essay, she writes:
Conveniently left out of our founding mythology is the fact that one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.
That passage now reads:
Conveniently left out of our founding mythology is the fact that one of the primary reasons some of the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.
“The clarification is small — just two words — but important,” Hannah-Jones said on Twitter.

Along with not understanding the difference between “all” and “some,” it appears the New York Times reporter struggles also with the definition of the word “small.” Because amending her essay to say that some of the colonists revolted to preserve slavery, as opposed to asserting it was a driving force behind the entire revolt, is a hell of a lot more than a “small” clarification.

Then again, there is always the possibility that she is merely being disingenuous, which would not be surprising considering she has not conducted herself as a good-faith operator since the 1619 Project’s debut in August 2019.

In fact, there are a few things suggesting Hannah-Jones and the New York Times corrected the record not for a love of truth and accuracy but begrudgingly and half-heartedly. First, there is the lengthy editor’s note the paper published this week arguing her original error was, essentially, fake but accurate. There is also the fact that her article’s title still reads, “Our democracy’s founding ideals were false when they were written. Black Americans have fought to make them true.”

Also, there is the rather uncomfortable fact that the correction comes only after a 1619 Project fact-checker revealed last week that her recommendations were explicitly ignored by the editorial staff. The timing of the fact-checker's allegation and the New York Times's correction leaves one with the distinct impression that the paper’s admission of error was more or less forced. It cannot go on simply dismissing critics as ignorant, possibly closeted racists when one of those critics is its own fact-checker. At that point, they have to own up to the mistake. Hence the resentful, mealy-mouthed correction.

Unsurprisingly, some in the news media are hailing Hannah-Jones for doing the bare minimum required of any journalist who bungles a story.

“As an [New York Times magazine] staffer who lives in an academic community,” tweeted Emily Bazelon, “shout out to [Hannah-Jones] … for making this change. They're recognizing that there is a more accurate account of this historical point & adjusting accordingly. That's what intellectual exchange is about.”

Do not be like Bazelon.

Hannah-Jones deserves no praise for at long last correcting an error fundamental to her entire project, which had been brought to her attention almost seven months ago by multiple academics whose objections any intellectually serious, humble person would have heeded.

Texto completo: Sen. Ron Johnson announced his intent to subpoena Blue Star Strategies executives and produce records as part of an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy firm that once employed Hunter Biden.
The move by Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, marks a change in strategy one day after the panel scrapped a vote to subpoena a former consultant for the Washington-based consulting firm.
“This subpoena is in furtherance of the Committee's ongoing work to address the many unanswered questions about potential conflicts of interest and the extent to which representatives of Burisma — including officials at Blue Star — used individuals with close personal connections to high-level officials within the Obama administration to gain access to and potentially influence U.S. government agencies,” the Wisconsin Republican wrote in a letter Thursday to Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the committee.
The subpoena calls for every record between Jan. 1, 2013, to the present of work done by Blue Star Strategies on behalf of Burisma Holdings or individuals associated with Burisma, such as Burisma owner and Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky.
Burisma is the Ukrainian gas company on which Hunter Biden, son of the current Democratic presidential front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden, served on the board from 2014 to 2019, including when the elder Biden took a leading role in carrying out U.S. policy toward Ukraine. President Trump and his allies have alleged the former vice president leveraged his position to protect his son from a Ukrainian investigation into Burisma's owner.
The subpoena also calls for Blue Star CEO Karen Tramontano and COO Sally Painter to testify before the committee about the documents the committee subpoenaed from their firm.
The subpoena of the Blue Star documents, Johnson noted in his letter to Peters, came after months of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on the committee over issuing a subpoena to former Blue Star consultant Andrii Telizhenko. Democrats on the committee were reluctant to go forward with the Burisma investigation, urging Johnson to focus more on potential Russian interference in the 2020 election.
Telizhenko is a political official at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., who claimed former Democratic National Committee consultant Alexandra Chalupa wanted him to participate in anti-Trump operations during the 2016 presidential cycle. Chalupa has denied this accusation.
By Wednesday afternoon, Johnson said both Republican and Democratic members of the committee agreed to subpoena documents related to their investigation from Blue Star as opposed to Telizhenko himself.
“During the course of these discussions, the suggestion was made by both Democrat and Republican members of our Committee that we should issue a subpoena directly to the source of the documents relevant to our work: Blue Star. I appreciate the engagement of our Committee members on this issue, and believe the appropriate course of action at this time is to accommodate that request,” Johnson wrote.
“Accordingly, pursuant to the Committee rules, this letter constitutes official notice that I intend to issue a subpoena to Blue Star, for the requests described in the enclosed schedule," Johnson said.
He added, “I stated I would seek documents from the consultant directly because, although he was willing to cooperate with the Committee's investigation, he was bound by a non-disclosure agreement,” Johnson said. “Conversely, Blue Star's responses to the Committee's December 3, 2019, request were incomplete.”
Tramontano recently told the New York Times her firm has provided dozens of documents to the Homeland Security panel and "will continue to cooperate" with the investigation "to the best of our ability.”

Texto completo: President Trump should go into a modified self-quarantine for his own safety and that of the entire senior ranks of the U.S. government.
He should do so because earlier this week he was standing immediately adjacent to a man who now has tested positive for the coronavirus. The man, Fabio Wajngarten, is the press secretary for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who had dinner with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.
In adopting some sort of quarantine, Trump would be following the lead of fellow Republicans — Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona, Doug Collins of Georgia, and Matt Gaetz of Florida — each of whom self-isolated after learning they had close contact with a man who soon thereafter was diagnosed with the virus. It also would track the response of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is in a form of voluntary self-isolation because his wife is exhibiting mild flu-like symptoms after a trip to the United Kingdom.
While it may not be practical to completely isolate the president, he should be tested for the virus, he should meet in person (rather than by electronic means) with as few people as practicable, and he should be kept physically as far as possible from those with whom he must meet in person. The modified quarantine should extend at least to the outer extent of the known incubation period for the COVID-19 virus.
The presidential quarantine is advisable both for Trump’s own safety and for the good of the U.S. government and people. For Trump, the consideration is this: If he has indeed contracted the virus, his health and very survival as a 73-year-old depend on him being kept as otherwise healthy as he can be. If his system is compromised by the virus, it could be more vulnerable than usual to any other pathogens. So-called secondary infections are common with viruses, and if the coronavirus pandemic behaves like the great flu pandemic in 1918-1920, the risk of death from secondary infections may be even greater than from the virus itself.
The world’s leading representative democracy cannot afford to be hobbled by the lack of a healthy president during a crisis of the sort we now face.
The need to keep other high officials safe is equally strong. No matter how confident Trump feels in his own health, the fact is that this is a highly contagious virus, and it can be spread even before its victims are symptomatic. It is not a sign of machismo, but of folly, for Trump to refuse to be tested and to continue interacting directly with the vice president, Cabinet members, top staff, and members of Congress. The current crisis could grow to massive proportions if the entire top ranks of government, along with the president, are in sick beds, perhaps fighting for their lives. With no healthy top officials and uncertain lines of authority below them, chaos could ensue.
Right now, this nation doesn’t need a president who is tough; it needs a chief executive who is humble, selfless, and wise. Trump may chafe at a modified quarantine, but the good of the nation requires it.

Ross Douthat: Sanders lost to Biden. And to the coronavirus.

Texto completo: There are two stories about how Joe Biden’s campaign, given up for dead two weeks ago, stormed back to take control of the Democratic primary, effectively burying the Bernie Sanders movement that had briefly seemed poised for an insurgent victory. One is for the pundits; the other, I suspect, is for the history books.
The pundit’s story analyzes the Democratic primary in terms of the Sanders campaign’s strategy, which seemed to assume that it was possible to win the party’s nomination as Donald Trump won the GOP nomination in 2016 — as a plurality candidate in a divided field who gradually brings the reluctant majority along when no other candidate can consolidate a larger coalition.
This strategy was by no means crazy; after the first three primaries it appeared likely to work. And had it worked, Sanders, like Trump before him, would have taken over a national political party on his own terms, conceding nothing to existing power brokers and would therefore have a clear opportunity to impose his will to remake the Democrats in his image, to dictate the terms of the establishment’s surrender.
But the rest of the field did consolidate, suddenly and surprisingly, around a resurgent Biden, and Sanders had neither prepared adequately for that possibility nor was quick enough to pivot in response.
It was not clear before Super Tuesday, but it does seem clear now, that Sanders had allowed himself to be tugged a bit too far left on culture-war issues to win the white working class in 2020 the way he did in 2016, while remaining too radical on economics to reassure and win suburbanites. And the moments when Sanders could have anticipated a possible Biden comeback — the days after his victory in Nevada — weren’t spent reassuring either set of Democrats that they could support his campaign without supporting a far-left revolution; they were spent in an either admirably principled or insanely truculent argument about how, no matter what the Cuban Communists did to political prisoners, you gotta hand it to their literacy efforts.
So Sanders lost because of his own choices, in the pundit story — because he expected a divided field and surging youth turnout and got a consolidated field and no youth surge, didn’t have a plan to win over waverers or moderates, and lost as he intended to win, a factional candidate to the end.
This story is entirely plausible, it fits with my analysis throughout the primary ... but still I suspect that in historical memory a different story will prevail, one that centers around neither candidate but instead makes the coronavirus the crucial player in the Democratic drama.
In this story, the Biden consolidation will be a subplot in the drama of contagion, the story of an America slowly awakening to the scale and scope of the coronavirus threat, and his swift victory will be placed in the same category as universities canceling classes and sending students home, or airports and tourist attractions emptying — all of them examples of a flight to safety, the surrender of grand plans and big ambitions in favor of a desire to just survive. Michigan voted for Biden overwhelmingly for the same reason that both Biden and Sanders canceled rallies just before the vote — because this is now the coronavirus election, against whose stark existential stakes all normal political battles must give way.
In this telling Sanders has less agency: There might have been more he could have done to reassure Democratic voters ideologically, but there was no way — even with Biden’s age and verbal stumbles — for a consummate outsider like the Vermont senator to portray himself as the most plausible choice to deal with such a mortal threat. Biden’s link to Barack Obama, in particular, gave him an insuperable advantage as the candidate of putting People Democrats Trust back in charge, and no clever socialist argument that Medicare for All would make it easier to take care of coronavirus patients was going to overcome the former vice president’s safe-choice status.
Is it possible to harmonize the two stories? To some extent: One can say that Sanders’ factional strategy enabled the Biden comeback, and that the coronavirus ratified it; one can say that, absent the coronavirus, Sanders could have extended the race for another month, but without a plan to expand beyond his true believers he still would have ultimately lost.
But Sanders supporters can take a cold sort of comfort from the fact that history likes to keep things simple. And the simplest way of describing the last two weeks of hectic politics and looming calamity is to say that whatever mistakes he made, whatever opportunities he passed up, in the final analysis Sanders didn’t lose the race because of his choices. He was vanquished only by an act of God.

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump will not be tested for the coronavirus after coming into contact with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus just days after participating in meetings with him in Florida, the White House said Thursday.
Fabio Wajngarten, a top communications aide to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, tested positive days after accompanying him to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and posing for a photo with the president and Vice President Mike Pence. In the photo, which he posted on social media, Wajngarten is standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump, who is clutching a brown “Make Brazil Great Again” baseball cap.
A video from the event also showed Wajngarten standing directly behind Trump and Bolsonaro as they spoke to a crowd.
After his meeting with the Brazilian delegation, Trump hosted a dinner for Bolsonaro and his aides. But Pence did not stay for the dinner, an aide said, and had not received any guidance from his physician that he needed to be tested or quarantined.
Wajngarten also stopped by the birthday party of Kimberly Guilfoyle, an adviser to Trump’s reelection campaign and the girlfriend of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., a campaign aide said. President Trump also attended the party.
But the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, played down Trump’s level of exposure. “Both the president and vice president had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,” Grisham said in a statement Thursday.

She also indicated that neither Trump nor Pence intended to self-quarantine as a precautionary measure. “There is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine,” Grisham said. “Exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps.”
While the White House has indicated that its bar for testing the commander in chief is high, Dr. Judith N. Wasserheit, a professor of global health and medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle, recommended otherwise. “Because of the critical roles that the president and vice president play, it would be wise to have a low threshold for testing regardless of symptom status,” she said.
Dr. Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said that anyone within 5 feet of an infected individual for five minutes or more had potential exposure to the virus. The recommendation for someone who had exposure would be to “stay home and monitor themselves” for 14 days, File said. “If they develop symptoms, they would be tested.”
In contrast to Trump and Pence, Sen. Rick Scott of Florida announced Thursday that he was self-quarantining after potential contact with Wajngarten.
Trump also chose not to get tested for the coronavirus last week after he had attended the Conservative Political Action Conference, where an attendee who was infected with the virus mingled with lawmakers. Four members of Congress — including Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who traveled with Trump on Air Force One last week — announced they were self-quarantining, citing an abundance of caution after coming into contact with the infected individual at the conference.
Trump, however, did not choose to take any precautionary measures. “He has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed Covid-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,” Grisham said this week. “President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.”
In an interview with “Fox & Friends” this week, Grisham dismissed the coronavirus as “something that is like a flu” and said that when it came to his own exposure, Trump was “not concerned about this at all” because he “uses hand sanitizer all the time.”
Still, some experts warned the risk was high. “Any public figure, including the president, who really doesn’t want to get infected has to understand: They can no longer be in the public domain with person-to-person contact like this and not get infected,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. “This virus will penetrate into our population.”
In the past, presidents made a point of personally taking precautions as an example to the public. In 1976, when President Gerald Ford embarked on an ambitious crash program to vaccinate tens of millions of Americans against what was thought to be a dangerous new strain of influenza, he was photographed receiving the vaccine in the White House as part of a public awareness campaign.
In 2002, President George W. Bush was vaccinated against smallpox after American troops and civilian health care and emergency workers were ordered to have inoculations before the invasion of Iraq out of fear that the country’s leader, Saddam Hussein, had biological weapons.
Administration officials have said they would consider starting a public-relations campaign around testing if that becomes necessary. But they noted that the White House was not recommending mass testing across the country, focusing instead on older Americans with underlying health conditions.
Photo ops of Trump or Pence getting tested, they said, would be inconsistent with a message that people should follow the recommendations of their doctors and that healthy Americans are likely to stay healthy.

Texto completo: Memo to Joe ...
Hey, things are going great. Take it easy.
Our former vice president is on a roll. A man who’d never won a primary before in three presidential campaigns pretty much swept the board on Super Tuesdays I & II. This was probably the best week of his entire political career.
Except maybe for the visit to an automobile plant in Detroit, where Biden called a union worker “full of s---” while shushing an aide who tried to get him to calm down.
It was during an argument over gun control. When his adversary said, “You’re working for me, man,” Biden swiftly retorted, “Don’t be such a horse’s ass.”
Several problems here, including the fact that when an, um, voter says, “You’re working for me,” the preferable response is: “Well, I certainly hope to be soon. You know, in the White House.”
Biden’s supporters are quick to note that said union member popped up on Fox News the next day, claiming the former vice president had gone after him for supporting the right to bear arms. Or actually, the right to bear semi-automatic weapons.
One way or another, it was a bad moment. But hey, Biden is 77 and he’s been schlepping all over the country, giving speeches, eating bad food, shaking hands. (Don’t shake hands!) During his big, celebratory appearance after the primaries last week, his wife had to fight off a sign-wielding vegan who stormed the victory podium.
So the Detroit incident is hardly a moment that’s going to live on in history. We could forget about it instantly were it not a reminder that Biden is not great at spontaneous back-and-forth, like you get in ... a debate. One of which is scheduled for Sunday, when he meets Bernie Sanders one-on-one.
Even Sanders seems to hope his opponent doesn’t screw this one up. Bernie’s I’m-still-in-it announcement Wednesday did not contain a single negative word about Biden. (On the other hand, within the first 50 seconds, he managed to call Donald Trump a “pathological liar” as well as “racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe and a religious bigot.” Kudos.)
Sanders began by acknowledging he’d had a bad night Tuesday, vote-wise. Indeed, any address in which a candidate’s most positive remark is “on the other hand, we won in North Dakota” could probably be described as bleak. Particularly when combined with an acknowledgment that tons of his admirers are saying that they’re going to vote for Biden because they think “Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.”
Which is kinda the whole point. Truly, if it was a choice between nominating the reincarnation of George Washington or the candidate most likely to defeat Donald Trump, Democrats would know which way to go.
All Sanders wants now is for Biden to adopt more of his political positions. And for the most part, the two men are on the same wavelength. It’s just that Sanders’ wavelength is more ... intense. For instance, he said he’s planning to ask Biden: “Are you really going to veto a Medicare-for-All bill if it is passed in Congress?” A perfectly fair answer would be to say: “Bernie, if I win, the chances that Congress is going to send me a Medicare-for-All bill when I want something less sweeping are approximately the size of an anthill. An anthill constructed for an ant-chihuahua. Don’t be a dope.”
Forget the part about not being a dope! Exactly where we are trying not to go.
The Biden camp thinks voters have no problem with his tendency to retort creatively. (Like the time a student asked about caucuses, and he wound up calling her “a lying dog-faced pony soldier.” Which was a joke. Seriously.)
Sure, it’s unlikely that debate teams of the future are going to be studying his rhetoric. Remember the time an 83-year-old Iowan claimed Biden was “too old” to be president and Biden challenged him to a pushup competition? But we’re talking choices here. Who wouldn’t rather have a president with a habit of babbling than one who’d move into the Oval Office and start deconstructing the government’s pandemic control team?
Perhaps you remember a speech to college students Biden gave a couple of years back, in which he semi-ranted about Trump’s record on manhandling women — always a perfectly reasonable target. But he then devolved into his dream of going back to high school to “beat the hell out” of the “guy who ended up becoming our national leader.” It sorta went downhill from there, with Biden saying that his experience in locker rooms told him that a man who talked like Trump “was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room.”
He seemed to be getting carried away. Although of course we’ve been through a lot since then. If he was giving the speech now, Biden could say the guy in the locker room “was usually the one who’d claim he knew all about medical science because one of his relatives taught at MIT.”
I’m only recalling this since it gives me a chance to point out that after I wrote, rather disapprovingly, about that particular address, Biden called to thank me “for showing me what a jerk I was.”
Try to imagine Donald Trump doing something like that.

Texto completo: Los Angeles • The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it would close the Disneyland resort in Anaheim for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and just the fourth time in its 65-year history, because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure — two adjoining, but separately ticketed theme parks — will close Saturday morning through the end of the month. Disney’s hotels in Anaheim will remain open until Monday.
Disney noted that there had been no reported cases of the virus at the resort.
The company said it would continue to pay its employees while the resort is closed. Refunds will be given for hotel bookings during the closure period.
Disneyland looms large in the popular imagination as the “happiest place on Earth,” where visitors trade an imperfect world for a perfect one. There is no trash blowing down Main Street U.S.A. Dream big, and the utopian technology of Tomorrowland just might come true. The animatronic figures inside It’s a Small World never stop smiling and singing. The park receives almost 19 million visitors from around the world each year.
In recent days, as sporting events, concerts and other mass gatherings have been canceled in response to the pandemic, Disneyland and its bigger sibling in Florida, Walt Disney World, remained crowded. On Wednesday night at 9, so many people were trying to get on Space Mountain at Disneyland that the line stretched more than an hour. Disneyland’s Indiana Jones ride had a 45-minute line.
In a statement posted online shortly before midnight Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said that gatherings of 250 or more people “should be canceled or postponed” to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
“Changing our actions for a short period of time will save the life of one or more people you know,” Newsom said. “That’s the choice before us. Each of us has extraordinary power to slow the spread of this disease.”
That seemed to apply to Disneyland and other California theme parks, including Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Knott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park. But Newsom backtracked at a Thursday morning news conference, saying that his guidelines excluded large parks like Disneyland and places such as casinos and movie theaters because of “the complexity of their unique circumstances.”
Disney made its announcement shortly thereafter.
“After carefully reviewing the guidelines of the governor of California’s executive order and in the best interest of our guests and employees, we are proceeding with the closure of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure,” the company said in a statement.
Disneyland, which employs roughly 31,000 people, has had unscheduled closures only three times since opening in 1955. The first time was in 1963 for a national day of mourning after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The second was in 1994 after the Northridge earthquake. The third was after the Sept. 11 attacks.
The resort has grown substantially since the last closing. It now consists of two popular theme parks: Disneyland and California Adventure, which together recorded attendance of roughly 28.7 million in 2018, the last year for which figures are available. Disney also operates three hotels in Anaheim and a shopping district called Downtown Disney, which will remain open.
Hundreds of other businesses in Anaheim and the surrounding cities rely on Disneyland to keep their cash registers ringing, from nearby mom-and-pop motels to fast-food restaurants outside the park gates to busing companies that shuttle families to and from airports. A 2018 study by professors at California State University, Fullerton, found that the Disneyland resort had an $8.5 billion annual impact on Southern California.
Walt Disney World in Florida — eight separately ticketed parks with combined annual attendance of 93 million — has so far not been affected. Disney Cruise Line, which operates four ships that can carry 13,400 people at any given time, also remains open.
Disney World, where Disney also owns and operates roughly 30 hotels, has experience with sudden closures. Disney has shuttered the resort for various lengths of time because of hurricanes, including Matthew in 2016, Frances in 2004 and Floyd in 1999.

Nicholas Kristof: Twelve steps to tackle the coronavirus

Texto completo: At least Emperor Nero supposedly only fiddled while Rome burned; he didn’t tell the Romans that the fire was no big deal.
President Donald Trump squandered two precious months trying to downplay the new coronavirus while attempting to talk up the stock market. We still have no idea how many Americans are infected, because the administration bungled diagnostics. As of a few days ago, South Korea had conducted up to 700 times more tests per capita than the United States.
Trump’s passivity will cost lives, but we can still make preparations before hospitals risk becoming overwhelmed by a pandemic that is both more contagious than the seasonal flu and apparently many times more lethal. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warns that in a plausible worst-case scenario, this virus could kill more than 1 million Americans.
After speaking to epidemiologists and public health specialists, I have a list of a dozen practical steps that the president and other officials should take immediately, while there is time.
1. Invest in a huge rollout of free testing so that we know who is sick. The University of Washington set up a drive-through system so that certain people can be tested without contaminating a clinic; South Korea did the same. We urgently need “rapid tests” — offering results in minutes — and before long we will also desperately need tests to determine who has had the virus and now has immunity.
2. Cancel large gatherings in parts of the country where community transmission is occurring, as Gov. Jay Inslee has done in Washington state. Employers should encourage people to work from home where possible. Even with social distancing, more than one-third of Americans may eventually be infected (a worst case is that 70% become infected, as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has cautioned for her country).
But lives will be saved by flattening the curve so that infections grow more slowly. We are much better off if 100 million Americans contract the coronavirus over 18 months rather than over 18 weeks, and this also gives scientists the chance to test treatments and develop vaccines, and to see if warmer weather helps. South Korea’s experience suggests that aggressive measures, well short of China’s, do help.
3. Expand telemedicine so that patients can get medical advice while staying home. The aim is for people to not go to a doctor’s office or ER unless necessary.
4. Plan for hospitals to be overwhelmed, as happened in Wuhan, China, and in Iran and northern Italy. Epidemiological models suggest that by late April we could have millions of Americans infected, and the danger is that people with other ailments die for want of care in the chaos. Several epidemiologists suggest that we could easily see 100 million infections of the new coronavirus in the United States, of which 5% or 10% might require hospitalization and 1% might need a ventilator. That could mean almost 1 million people needing ventilators just for COVID-19, although not all at the same time, yet we have only about 72,000 full ventilators in the United States.
5. Cancel vacations of health workers, bring back retired doctors and nurses, and repurpose cardiologists and pediatricians to deal with a torrent of coronavirus patients — in expectation of record numbers of doctors out sick. We should prepare to allow military medics to assist in ERs as well.
6. Make nursing homes, assisted-living centers, homeless shelters, prisons and dialysis treatment centers safer, by encouraging use of personal protective equipment and limiting visitors.
7. Make plans in case first responders, such as firefighters and ambulance paramedics, become sick in large numbers. That may mean calling in the National Guard.
8. Ensure that as many people as possible have access to medical care. That means expanding Medicaid in remaining states and establishing a mechanism so that no one needs to pay (including a copay or deductible) for testing for or treatment of COVID-19.
9. Congress should promptly pass legislation (shamefully stalled for the last 16 years) mandating paid sick leave for all workers.
10. Greatly step up production of personal protective equipment needed in hospitals. Some hospitals are already running short of N95 masks, and America’s emergency stockpile has only 12 million N95 masks — approximately a one-day supply for the country during an epidemic.
11. Prepare for public school students to attend classes remotely in parts of the country most affected. Researchers found that during the 1918 Spanish flu, cities that canceled schools and public gatherings — and did so early — fared better than other cities. Unfortunately, today at least 6 million American schoolchildren don’t have internet access at home; that may mean that schools hand out hotspots and laptops to students without computers. A nonprofit called FirstBook is trying to send out 6 million books to low-income schools so that kids can at least read while at home.
12. Instead of bailing out airlines or cruise lines, make people in quarantine eligible for unemployment insurance and waive work requirements for benefit programs. Don’t let struggling families become homeless because they suddenly can’t make the rent or meet mortgage payments.
Enough with your fiddling, Mr. President. Let’s roll.

Jana Riess: Dear Latter-day Saints, please take coronavirus seriously

Texto completo: On Wednesday, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints took the rare step of prohibiting attendance at its upcoming semiannual General Conference, which is scheduled for April 4–5, because of the coronavirus. The conference’s 10 hours of programming will go forward as planned, with speakers and music being streamed live online, but the 21,000-seat Conference Center in Salt Lake City will be empty.
The church has been promising for months that this particular General Conference, which will commemorate the 200th anniversary of founder Joseph Smith’s “First Vision,” would be historic and unlike any other previous conference. Well, it’s certainly new and different, but not in the ways we hoped for. It’s not the absolute first time that General Conference has been closed to the public, but it has not occurred during many members’ lifetimes; this happened roughly 75 years ago during World War II. President Russell M. Nelson, who is 95, no doubt remembers that, but most of the rest of us do not.
I was glad to hear the church’s announcement, because over the past few weeks I’ve seen many members fail to take this virus seriously. Just this Sunday at church a very smart person I care about complained that the threat is overhyped and people are panicking for no reason, since it’s just like the seasonal flu.
She’s not alone in voicing this, but the view is dangerously wrong.
This is not the seasonal flu. Even if the death rate from coronavirus turns out to be just 1% instead of 2% to 3%, which the earliest studies showed, or over 6% (!), which is what it is as of today in Italy, a death rate of 1% is still 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.
This is a novel virus for which we have no prior immunity and no vaccine.
Let that sink in for a minute. This means the two things that normally slow the spread of a viral infection are not available to us. The only protection we have is to try to slow the virus as it moves through the population, so that it can’t reproduce faster than the world’s health care systems can treat the sick. And the only ways to do that are through quarantines, compulsive hand-washing, and (we pray) prayer.
In Italy, the infection is spreading so quickly that hospitals can’t keep up. There are reports of ICU patients being treated in hallways because there are no beds available. A Newsweek op-ed by someone who identifies herself as “a doctor in a major hospital in Western Europe” says her colleagues in northern Italy are actually having to prioritize which patients to save, because the system is overwhelmed with so many people being sick at the same time.
Remember that statistic about how more than 80% of people experience only mild symptoms with coronavirus and feel like they have the regular seasonal flu? Terrific — for them. But that means that up to 20% can have more severe cases, some requiring hospitalization and even acute respiratory care. If our health care system is slammed all at once, the U.S. is in trouble. According to The New York Times, the U.S. has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people, which is even less than Italy (3.2).
We have got to Slow. It. Down.
Having the church step in and so clearly take the coronavirus seriously is a significant step in getting Latter-day Saints around the world to pay attention. And church leaders didn’t just stop at limiting General Conference. Some other announcements included:
* A ban on large religious gatherings in areas “where illness caused by COVID-19 is a challenge,” including much of Asia, Europe, the United States and Canada.
* Restrictions on new recruits to the Missionary Training Centers in Provo and Preston, England. As of March 16, anyone who had been scheduled to enter those MTCs to train for a mission will “be trained remotely by videoconference.”
* Cancellations at church-owned Brigham Young University, including graduation exercises, the annual BYU Women’s Conference, devotionals, lectures, performances and concerts. Some of these things will be livestreamed; others will be postponed or canceled altogether.
* More temple closures. This is something I was particularly grateful to see, since so many temple patrons are elderly and therefore more vulnerable to the virus. The temple ceremonies themselves also involve a fair amount of physical contact and hand-to-hand touching. These closures are happening all over the world now, not just in hot spot places like Japan and Italy. I woke up to the news that our own region’s temple in Louisville will be closed effective immediately, at least through the weekend.
* Sunday meeting cancellations. The last part of the church’s statement says that “In relation to weekly worship services, activities and other meetings, members should follow the guidance of their local leaders, who will receive direction in the usual manner.” This suggests that sacrament meetings and Sunday school will be canceled in some parts of the U.S., as has happened elsewhere in the world. This afternoon, Utah’s governor stated that starting on Monday, through month’s end, there should be no meetings of 100 people or more anywhere in the state. “This includes church gatherings,” he clarified.
Most of the chatter I’ve seen in reaction to the church’s decisions has been positive, though some Latter-day Saints wonder if the church overreacted by not permitting the public to attend conference. It is not an overreaction. It boils down to this: Which member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Presidency do you see as expendable? The death rate for the elderly is disproportionately high, apparently in the range of 10% to 12%. Statistically, that means that if all 15 elderly men in the Quorum and the First Presidency came down with the virus, one or two of them would die of it.
I hope that Latter-day Saints who are lucky enough to stay healthy over these next weeks and months will remember that we’re isolating ourselves to protect the most vulnerable people in our society. Sam Brown, an ICU physician in Salt Lake City, has a wonderful post about this at By Common Consent, in which he outlines things that members of the church can do to practice “social distancing” (isolation) while also continuing to study the gospel together online, take care of the poor, and keep each other’s spirits afloat. For once I would advise also reading the comments. They’re actually helpful and interesting, especially this one from Sam, who says that our swift action now can mitigate disaster:
“We have vulnerable people at high risk for imminent death, and we can actually step in and save them with modifications to our society that only last a month or two. This is a Willie and Martin handcart company moment, in my view.”
Yes, this is a Willie and Martin Handcart company moment. The Sunday sermon for every Sunday in the near future is this: Do everything you can to benefit your neighbor, even at cost to yourself. The gospel lesson every day for the weeks and months to come is this: The job of the 80% is to deliver the 20% to safe harbor.

Texto completo: Our sermon for today concerns a workplace problem that everyone has, except me.
Everybody is dying to read what I write at work. Take you, for example. But what you write -- an insightful memo, an urgent email, a game-changing report -- nobody wants to read.
Or so says Aaron Orendorff.
Orendorff is the author of "Your Colleagues Don't Read Anything You Write. Here Are 8 Ways to Change That," a recent article in The New York Times.
A sympathetic soul, Orendorff is quick to assure you that "it's not personal." "We're just inundated," he writes, with a flood of communications. The result is a "wasteland of no response," in which "our words disappear into the ether."
The following are a few tips for making your verbiage irresistible -- just like mine.
No. 1: "Write less often."
Pick one or two critical areas, and concentrate your communications on those subjects. For example, instead of emailing your managers that your CFO has just purchased a one-way ticket to the tropical island of Bongo-Bongo, an offshore banking oasis with no extradition treaty, make the subject of your next email an in-depth analysis on the significance of Max cheating with Dayna on "Vanderpump Rules."
Now that's a critical area on which you can concentrate that everyone wants to read.
No. 2: Establish a 24-hour waiting period.
"Armed with technologies like smartphones, Slack and Skype, it's easy to operate in rapid-response mode," warns author Liz Wiseman, who further advises, "When another recipient could or should answer, give that person the right of first response."
Excellent advice. You will be known as someone who is considerate, and you are significantly less likely to put forward a dumb response that will lead to a short meeting with human resources and a very long period of unemployment.
No. 3: "Use fewer words."
"Brevity is the soul of wit," wrote Shakespeare, a policy that Orendorff asserts should be applied to your own communications. I don't agree. Shakespeare had a cushy niche in the Elizabethan gig economy with no penny-pinching managers breathing down his ruffled collar. In your position, tenuous as it is, you want to use lots and lots of words to give the appearance that you are actually working.
Best of all, since no one will read your words, feel free to insert bits and pieces of random writing into your communications. I'll wager that you could slip the entire text of "Hamlet" into your next report, and no one will notice. (Even if they do read it, the inserted text will make perfect sense in your workplace. After all, the major themes of the play are betrayal and revenge.)
No. 4: "Put action words in your subject line."
To keep communications short and sweet, "tell your recipients before word one what's expected."
According to Orendorff's example, if you want feedback on an upcoming meeting, instead of writing "Agenda for Tuesday" in the subject line of your email, use "PLEASE COMMENT: Agenda for Tuesday."
This is probably a good rule for someone who does want feedback, but since you never want to deal with any opinions other than your own, adapt the technique for your own mildly egomaniacal approach to work with a subject line like "PLEASE IGNORE: Agenda for Tuesday," or "Agenda for Tuesday, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND KEEP YOUR NOSE OUT OF MINE."
An email like this is sure to get you the action you want -- being left alone.
No. 5: "Don't make it about you, or 'them.'"
When you are crafting your minimessage, make it about "us."
"When seeking assistance or buy-in, we typically ask colleagues for their 'opinion,'" Orendorff writes. "Turns out, that's a mistake. ... When we ask for 'advice,' people see themselves as partners. And advice versus feedback significantly increases both the amount and quality of responses."
By asking for "advice," you will have to deal with someone else's stupid ideas instead of your own stupid ideas, but you also get something truly valuable in return -- an accomplice. Yes, you can defend your ideas with figures and facts, but the best defense against management coming down on you is having someone else to blame.
Best of all, if your workplace BFF has offered their advice in writing, you have the proof you need to pin the disastrous outcome on someone else.
You may not keep your friend, but you will keep your job. And you will have certainly learned a bigger lesson: The only strategy better than keeping your written communications short is not to communicate at all.

Texto completo: Un gráfico resume (y aclara) la estrategia mundial ante el nuevo coronavirus y el objetivo que deben perseguir todas las naciones. La curva de la pandemia ayuda a entender cómo se puede reducir el número de muertes y de personas infectadas.
La infografía muestra, en realidad, dos curvas que los expertos llaman epi y que muestra la progresión de una enfermedad desconocida . Una de ellas, con un pico más pronunciado, indica los efectos del brote de coronavirus en el corto plazo . El otro, con una pendiente más plana, indica una tasa de infección más gradual , pero durante un periodo de tiempo más largo.
“Lo que necesitamos es aplanarla”, explicó Anthony Fauci director del Instituto Nacional de Alergia y Enfermedades Infecciosas. Para ello, explicó Fauci el martes durante una reunión en la Casa Blanca, se debe “interferir con el flujo natural del brote”.
“Comprender y controlar el aumento es una parte importante de la preparación”, dijo a The New York Times, el doctor Drew Harris, un analista que ha trabajado en el diseño de programas de preparación para una pandemia. En un curso de formación sobre el tema, Harris añadió al gráfico una línea de puntos que indicaba la capacidad del sistema sanitario “para dejar claro qué estaba en juego”.
Harris publicó el pasado 27 de febrero el gráfico en sus redes sociales y “ahora sé lo que significa hacerse viral”, dijo el doctor al Times.
Important to remember that #Covid-19 epidemic control measures may only delay cases, not prevent. However, this helps limit surge and gives hospitals time to prepare and manage. It's the difference between finding an ICU bed & ventilator or being treated in the parking lot tent. pic.twitter.com/VOyfBcLMus
— Drew Harris (@drewaharris) February 28, 2020
La curva más pronunciada (roja) indica una rápida propagación del virus, mientras que la más plana (azul), muestra que el virus se está expandiendo más lentamente. Al disminuir la velocidad de contagio, el segundo caso evita sobrecargar los recursos sanitarios (que representan la línea de puntos).
“El objetivo ideal en la lucha contra una epidemia o pandemia es detener por completo la propagación. Pero simplemente reducir la velocidad (mitigación) es fundamental “, explicó el doctor Harris. Al ralentizar la propagación de la enfermedad, las instituciones sanitarias tienen más tiempo para prepararse y no colapsar. Por tanto, aplanar la curva, aunque sea extendiéndola en el tiempo, “salvará vidas”.

Texto completo: 'The Rich Really Do Pay Lower Taxes Than You" read a headline in the New York Times last fall. This astounding claim, presented in the media as fact and evidence of inequities baked into President Trump's 2017 tax cut, came from two economists at the University of California, Berkeley. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman asserted that 2018 was the first year in U.S. history that the average tax rate on the 400 wealthiest income earners dipped below the rates paid by the lower-middle class and poor.
Finally, we had proof the rich weren't paying their fair share. But new data from the Internal Revenue Service suggest it isn't true.
The Saez-Zucman analysis raised eyebrows among other economists who study tax data, in part because they claimed it reflected the first full year under the new tax rates. At the time they published their study, the IRS had yet to release the data necessary to make the calculations they described. Preliminary numbers for 2018 income-tax returns , covering all filings made by last year's Oct. 15 extended deadline, came out only last week. These data tell a very different story: America's wealthiest earners still carry the lion's share of the tax burden.
Closer inspection reveals that Messrs. Saez and Zucman imputed the tax rates they claim for 2018 from records that predated the Trump tax cut, and therefore didn't capture its effect on the measured distribution of income. They built in opaque assumptions that now appear to have exaggerated the tax cut's benefit to high-income earners.
This wasn't the only problem with the Saez-Zucman statistics. Their alleged 23% tax rate paid by the highest earners—encompassing all federal, state and local taxes—fell below the Congressional Budget Office's estimates for the top income percentile's federal tax rate alone. The two economists' tax rates for the poor also looked suspiciously high. A 25% rate for the lowest quintile of earners would be almost twice the level found in other estimates , including those using better-established data from the Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The discrepancy arose from Messrs. Saez and Zucman's exclusion of the earned-income tax credit for low-income households, artificially inflating the amount of tax the poor really pay.
The new IRS numbers now provide reason to doubt Messrs. Saez and Zucman's entire narrative of a regressive U.S. tax system designed to favor the rich at the expense of the poor. The IRS reports effective income-tax rates on the adjusted gross incomes of different groups of earners. That's the percentage of income that people actually pay to the government, as distinct from the statutory tax rate.
According to the IRS, the top 0.01% of earners—those with incomes above $10 million—paid a 24.8% effective federal income-tax rate in 2018. This isn't very different from the 25.3% the group paid in 2017, and is higher than the average rate of 22.5% on the same group during the George W. Bush administration. As these rates only encompass federal income taxes, most filers can expect to add another 8% to 12% of income from other forms of taxation, placing their total burden well above the Saez-Zucman numbers.
How does that affect the claims of regressivity? It's true the remainder of the top 1% (those with incomes between roughly $500,000 and $10 million) paid a slightly higher effective rate, at 26.5%, than the top 0.01% did. But tax rates drop rapidly from there, with filers in the $50,000 to $75,000 reporting bracket (approximately the median U.S. family income) facing an average federal income-tax rate of 8.4%.
People who earned between $15,000 and $40,000 paid an average federal rate of merely 4% of their adjusted gross incomes in 2018. And thanks to the earned-income tax credit and others like it, the poorest earners paid very little if any federal income tax at all.
In short, the federal income-tax structure still places the unambiguous bulk of its burden on the highest earners. The Trump tax cut hasn't changed that. In 2018, the top 1% of U.S. earners paid roughly 37% of all federal income taxes. The top 5% paid around 58%. This suggests that policy makers wishing to mitigate regressive features of the tax system should look elsewhere. State and local sales and property taxes may be a more promising area for reform.
The IRS's preliminary data also suggests that the needle on income inequality—the motive force behind the Saez-Zucman research and the wealth-tax proposals it has been used to support—hasn't moved lately. The share of adjusted gross income that went to the top 1% in 2018 was essentially the same as it was a decade earlier, at least going by the IRS numbers. The same is true of the top 0.1% and even the top 0.01%, the ultrarich so often targeted in political rhetoric from the left.
The full economic effects of the Trump tax cut extend beyond personal income-tax rates, and will be seen in the data only when future statistical releases become available. The corporate income-tax cut, for example, will likely prompt high earners to shift income from their personal returns to corporate returns, further lowering the measured income shares of the top 1%. Ironically, the reduction in the corporate tax rate could lead to a statistical reduction in income inequality.
In their rush to embrace a convenient political narrative last fall, much of the press and political classes never considered the possibility that the data would undermine their story. It did.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In the Oval Office Thursday, a head of government laid out the measures he was taking to keep his country safe from the coronavirus: He would close schools starting the next day, ban indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, and suspend outdoor events with more than 500 people.
“We need to do this for a couple of weeks," he said somberly, “to make sure the virus doesn't spread."
The leader wasn't President Trump.
It was Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who had been welcomed to the White House by Trump amid a widening crisis that has upended daily life for millions of Americans and tested their tolerance for a president who prides himself on his capacity for disruption.
Varadkar's clear instructions and cautious tone bore a sharp contrast to Trump's freewheeling response to a crisis that threatens to subsume both his presidency and his campaign for reelection.
The collapse of the stock market and the spread of the coronavirus are creating a political and leadership crisis for a president who was elected on promises to blow up Washington bureaucracy and who has survived previous controversies by dismissing unfavorable facts and pointing to a roaring economy. His instinct to downplay what is now a global pandemic has sown confusion in the United States and given the man he will likely face in November, former vice president Joe Biden, the opportunity to present himself as a calming and stable force in a time of trouble.
“It'll go very quickly," Trump said breezily on Thursday of the outbreak, insisting he was taking decisive action even as his administration has struggled to address basic questions about testing for the virus and he himself seemed unsure about the exact number of people it has killed in the country so far.
“What is the number as of this morning, 32?" he asked as he sat next to Varadkar and referred to a reporter just off camera. “Is it 32 deaths, Steve?" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed the US fatalities on Thursday afternoon at 36.
“We do need separation for a little period of time in some cases," Trump added, without specifying exactly what that means. He urged Americans to wash their hands.
Trump's press conference with Varadkar came the morning after he gave a somber national TV address from the Oval Office in which he announced he was curbing travel to the United States from Europe — a policy health experts say would do little to stop the community spread already happening here.He uttered multiple inaccuracies that had to be corrected soon after the 10-minute speech. Even some Republicans said his performance did little to help his cause.
“His business-as-usual approach in the early days of the crisis leaves him uniquely vulnerable to attacks over his handling of the crisis," said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who advised Senator Marco Rubio's presidential run in 2016. “I think it's clear that this crisis is likely to define his term."
The coronavirus has forced Trump out of his comfort zone of improvisational and revved-up rallies, which have been canceled for now, and into the more difficult terrain of grave telemprompter speeches. But that's exactly the field where Biden, who struggles to attract passionate crowds on the trail and can make mistakes when off-script, would like the election to be played on.
By Thursday, Biden sought to capitalize on what his supporters see as a leadership vacuum by delivering a weighty coronavirus speech of his own and rolling out a sweeping plan to contain and stop the spread of the virus.
“President Trump is welcome to adopt all of it today," said Biden, who harkened back to his days dealing with the Ebola crisis during the Obama administration. “When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better, and recover better. We'll lead with science and listen to the experts."
Seeking to project presidential readiness, Biden has already convened his own Public Health Advisory Committee, and called for free coronavirus testing, more frequent reporting of vital public health statistics, and for the country to lead a coordinated global effort to stop the spread of the illness.
It was a split-screen moment that Democrats hoped would embody a fundamental contrast between Biden and Trump, as well as the former vice president's central argument for his own election: That the country needs to go back to stable leadership.
“Any time a crisis happens at this magnitude in the middle of an election, it fundamentally alters the way voters are perceiving the contest," said Ian Sams, a Democratic strategist who worked on Senator Kamala Harris's presidential bid, and who said Biden's depth of experience and measured tone could be an asset to him now. “This moment is sort of tailor-made for Biden's greatest strengths."
History is filled with examples of leaders who rose to the moment and it is possible that Trump will seek to change the narrative by acting decisively to vanquish the outbreak.
At that same time, public health experts insist that Trump needs to communicate more clearly and move more aggressively to increase testing and take other steps to prevent the spread of the virus, even as slow responses in Europe are blamed for mounting death tolls.
But Trump has not yet shown a willingness to make changes to his governing style that might help him do that.
“Trump was elected to shake things up and blow up the system and he's done that," said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist. “But this is a moment when people want strong steady leadership and Trump needs to adjust his style and he hasn't done that."
Biden, on the other hand, can take advantage of the suspension of regular campaign rallies — a format Trump loves, but where Biden is less comfortable — to deploy a “Rose Garden campaign where he can give serious scripted speeches instead of going out to rallies and making errors," Williams said.
On Thursday, Trump's Twitter feed was a mix of guidance from the CDC on hand-washing and other information and complaints about a “coup" against him, which is how he described the now-closed Russia investigation. He has claimed in recent days that anyone who wants to be tested for the coronavirus can be — an assertion that has been challenged by public health officials and even his own Republican allies.
“If you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test," he said, calling the whole process “smooth."
“People should stop saying if you want a test, you should get a test right now," Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, told CNN. “That's not here at this point."
On Thursday, the CDC website reported just 11,000 people had been tested for the virus in the United States since January — a stunning number compared to a country like South Korea, where 20,000 people are being tested every day in a strategy known as “trace, test, and treat."
The coronavirus isn't only threatening Trump's reelection prospects. On Thursday, the president dismissed concerns that he himself might be exposed to the virus, after it was revealed he spent time with a Brazilian official last week who has tested positive for it.
“We'll find out what happens," he told reporters. “Let's put it this way, I'm not concerned."

Trump's virulent state of denial

Texto completo: The coronavirus pandemic is already well entrenched on American soil. With more than a thousand diagnosed cases across 42 states and the District of Columbia — and probably many, many more undiagnosed patients yet to be tallied — it's clear that the virus is here inside our borders and spreading within our communities.
That's why it's perplexing that the president of the United States would choose this week to announce a ban on travel from 26 European countries as the centerpiece of his administration's response to the public health and economic crisis underway. At a time when we should have a leader in the White House equipped to respond and reassure the nation, the markets, and the world, Trump's announcement on Wednesday night took European leaders by surprise and distracted Americans from the real work that must be done to mitigate the spread of the virus in the United States. It also sent a harmful message to countries around the world that the US president, instead of being poised to collaborate to fight the pandemic across borders, views it as a foreign invasion.
Banning travel might have made sense in January, and it might still prevent some new cases. But what Americans need to know from the president now is what to do here at home. State and local leaders, many of whom lack direct access to the federal government's font of scientific expertise, need direction and support for critical decisions they should be making now to stave off worst-case scenarios, including whether to call off all large events, when to shut down schools, and how to shore up their hospitals and health care systems. The vacuum of leadership in the White House has forced many to read between the lines of statements from federal infectious disease experts like Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, who testified this week that Americans should avoid large gatherings and who has been subtly contradicting the president's blind denial in order to warn us that the worst of this epidemic is yet to come.
Trump sees the current crisis as “a global war not a global pandemic," Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security and a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, told the Globe Thursday. Calling Covid-19 “a foreign virus" and targeting travel from Europe, Kayyem says, is an “incomprehensible priority" at this stage of the pandemic. It's not that it won't make any difference, but it turns our attention away from the real challenge.
Given Trump's track record with science-based policy and with this epidemic, it should come as little surprise that he still fails to grasp the nature and scope of the current catastrophe and is still failing the country with his administration's response. In late January, the president was reassuring the nation that it was just “one person coming in from China," that all was under control, and that we would not have an outbreak in the United States. By late February, when it was clear to the government's own experts that an epidemic in the United States was emerging, he was still claiming that the number of people infected in the country was going down instead of rising. His primary goal, it seems, has been to keep the stock market up in an election year, but even on that measure he has epically failed: His equivocation, contradiction of science, and denial have made it clear to Wall Street that he can't be trusted at the wheel. His presidency will long be known for ending an 11-year bull run in the stock market in precipitous and calamitous fashion because of a foreseeable disaster he did little to prevent.
Imagine a president who could respond to this global crisis in a way that would incite action, allay fear, and bring Americans and the world community together to tackle the pandemic and do their part in service of the greater good. Whatever or whoever comes to mind, it's probably far from the person who spoke from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. It's too late to close borders. Our attention needs to turn to the dysfunction within.

Texto completo: Purely as a matter of economics, it’s perfectly understandable why Hachette Book Group would toss Woody Allen overboard hoping to keep his son Ronan Farrow happy.
At 32, Farrow is a journalistic supernova. His Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker articles about Harvey Weinstein in 2017 helped usher in the MeToo movement. And his book “Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,” a cloak-and-dagger account of how he got the story, was an instant best-seller, selling more than 200,000 copies. The publisher was Little, Brown & Co., one of Hachette’s two primary imprints.
Allen is 84. His career peaked more than 40 years ago. Though Allen has written books before - collections of short humor pieces - they also were published decades ago.
It is unlikely that Grand Central Publishing, Hachette’s other imprint, bought Allen’s memoir, “Apropos of Nothing,” expecting more than modest sales.
So when Farrow said he was severing ties with the company, and more than 100 Hachette employees walked out in protest of the Allen book it didn’t take Hachette long to fold.
From a revenue point of view, it was the obvious move. But in every other way, the decision stinks. There are times when the right thing to do is to stand up for principle, even if it costs some money or causes a valued performer to walk away. This was one of those times.
Farrow’s objection is that his sister Dylan - Allen’s adopted daughter - has accused Allen of sexually abusing her in the early 1990s when she was 7. (Her mother, Mia Farrow, has long made the same accusation.) In an email to Michael Pietsch, the chief executive officer of Hachette, Farrow wrote:
“Your policy of editorial independence among your imprints does not relieve you of your moral and professional obligations to the publisher of ‘Catch and Kill,’ and as the leader of a company being asked to assist in efforts by abusive men to whitewash their crimes.”
Farrow got it backward. Pietsch’s obligation was to publish Allen’s book.
There are two principles at stake. The first is the core American belief that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Allen’s case is much different from those of, say, Harvey Weinstein or Matt Lauer, whose actions were confirmed by investigations.
Although Allen has engaged in creepy behavior - there is his marriage to another of Mia Farrow’s adopted children, Soon-Yi Previn - Dylan Farrow is the only one who has ever accused him sexual abuse.
Allen always has denied Dylan Farrow’s accusation and has long accused her mother of planting the idea during their acrimonious breakup. Connecticut authorities investigated, bringing in the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale-New Haven Hospital, which concluded that Allen had not abused Dylan. He was never charged.
What this feels like is a sad family drama. Another of Allen’s adopted children, Moses Farrow, a family therapist, has supported his father. Mia Farrow has cut off all contact with Moses; Dylan and Ronan will have nothing to do with Allen or his wife, their sister.
But the MeToo movement changed the perception. A number of actors who had been cast in his films expressed regret. In 2018, Amazon.com abruptly ended a deal with Allen and canceled a movie. Now his memoir also has been canceled. Despite zero proof, the mob has pronounced him guilty.
Which leads me to the second principle: Mobs shouldn’t decide what gets published. That seemed to be Pietsch’s position. He noted: “We do not allow anyone’s publishing program to interfere with anyone else’s … Each book has its own mission … Our job as a publisher is to help the author achieve what they have set out to do in the creation of their book.”
But the rank and file were having none of it. Hachette held two town-hall meetings, which were followed by a walkout of more than 100 employees. They demanded that Grand Central cancel the book, but they also demanded that the company recognize that Hachette employees have the ability to speak up about books with which they disagree without fear of reprisal.
Sure, why not? Let’s see: Hachette has a division called Center Street, and a few months ago it published “Triggered” by Donald Trump Jr., a book devoted to mocking and smearing liberals. What’s to prevent an uprising of employees over that book or over his father’s autobiography when his presidency is over?
Hachette also publishes the work of acclaimed photographer Sally Mann, who has printed pictures of her naked children. Could you see a right-wing mob objecting to her work? I sure could.
In the aftermath of Hachette’s decision, author Stephen King tweeted: “Daniel Okrent, the author and former public editor of The New York Times, sent me an email that read in part: ‘Trump publishes. Hannity publishes. OJ publishes. HITLER publishes, for chrissakes.’ But not Woody Allen.”
I have no special insight into Allen’s memoir. My guess is he would have laid out his side of the controversy, thus giving readers additional context. But in the moment we’re living in, the employees of a large book publisher concluded that readers didn’t deserve that information. Their action is a repudiation of everything for which publishing is supposed to stand.
Friday, after Hachette announced it was canceling Allen’s book, Suzanne Nossel, the executive director of the PEN American Center, which defends free expression, issued a short statement: “As a defender of free speech and the availability of a wide breadth of books and ideas, we also fervently hope that the outcome does not lead publishers to shy away from manuscripts that editors think are worthwhile but that are about, or even by, people who may be considered contemptible.”
Sadly, they already have.

Texto completo: The Global Cinema Film Festival of Boston (March 20-22), as the title suggests, screens films that take us to different places in the world where people not unlike ourselves confront challenges we can recognize. Their perseverance inspires hope and sometimes suggests possible solutions for our own problems. (As of press time, the festival was going forward as scheduled.)
Our country may be wracked with divisions, but they can't compare with those simmering in Lebanon. The civil war that ended there 25 years ago and killed 250,000 people still reverberates, and its unresolved enmities threaten to undermine the country's fragile stability. Marlene Edoyan's “The Sea Between Us" (screens March 22 at 8 p.m. at the Studio Cinema in Belmont) tells the stories of two women from different sides of that struggle — Wafaa, a Christian who fought with the Phalangist militia, and Hayat, a Muslim whose two brothers died trying to protect their family.
Though some of her former comrades advise her to forget the past and move on, and though she even reminisces with former enemies about skirmishes in which they tried to kill each other, Wafaa still clings to the old divisions and dreams of restoring a sectarian Lebanon. Hayat, on the other hand, has become an activist working to bring together the former warring parties.
Meanwhile the ongoing civil war in neighboring Syria threatens to engulf their nation's tenuous peace. Wafaa and other Christians resent the influx of millions of displaced Syrians, and Hayat grieves when her nephew Ali is killed fighting across the border for Hezbollah. The film ends with the two women campaigning for opposing parties in a national election — a process that hopefully will bring about a peaceful reconciliation.
Diana Neille and Richard Poplak's “Influence" (screens March 20 at 9 p.m. at the Studio Cinema Belmont) also features activists campaigning for change, but in this case against a more insidious and sophisticated adversary — an onslaught of weaponized disinformation from foreign sources much like that inflicted on the United States.
The chief culprit is Lord Tim Bell (he died in 2019 at 77), a British advertising whiz whose five-decade-long career progressed from making sexy commercials for blue jeans to founding the “reputation-management" company Bell Pottinger. His groundbreaking methods of snappy simplification and obfuscating sloganeering helped British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher win three elections but fell short in a campaign for Chilean dictator August Pinochet's handpicked successor. Bell finally got his comeuppance when he was caught attempting to cover up the South African government's corruption by provoking atavistic racial conflict. The film credits in part the determination of opposition candidates to expose the deceit and unify the country for that turnaround.
Briskly edited, globe-hopping, and compulsively watchable, the film might have earned Bell's own admiration for its concision and cogency. He might also have appreciated its depiction of his image; as seen in interview clips, he comes across as Olympian, charismatic, and admittedly amoral.

Truth or consequences
Meanwhile, back in the United States, the democratic process endures the relentless assault of liars, manipulators, conspiracy mongers, amoral owners of vast social network platforms, and an infinite army of Russian bots.
How did we get here? Andrew Rossi's “After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News" takes us through the history of the phenomenon from back when “fake news" actually referred to misinformation designed to delude and manipulate the masses, to the present day when it has become a mantra demonizing real news reported by real journalists.
Does anyone remember the paranoia surrounding “Jade Helm 15," the 2015 US military exercise in Texas? Alex Jones of InfoWars and others convinced many residents that it was a plot to invade the state, disarm the citizenry, and imprison thousands of dissidents in Walmart stores via underground tunnels. So many lies and hoaxes have gone viral since then it's hard to keep them straight.
Like “Pizzagate" in October 2016 when reports on Reddit and 4chan alleged that then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta were running a pedophile ring in a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. Alex Jones ranted about the outrage while alt-right activists Michael Cernovich and John Posobiec and an army of bots promoted it, until a patriot with an assault rifle invaded the establishment. He wanted to save the endangered children, he told police, seemingly unaware that in doing so he was endangering the actual children who were there enjoying their pizza. Nobody was hurt, but the pizzeria owner still is inundated with death threats.
Other fake news highlights: The canard seized on by Sean Hannity and Fox News that Seth Rich, a Clinton staffer who was killed in 2016 in a botched robbery, was murdered to prevent him from spilling dirt on Hillary Clinton to Julian Assange and Wikileaks; the claim that David Hogg, survivor of the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting in which 17 people were killed, was in fact a “crisis actor" and that there was no shooting at all. Before long, you might feel like the BuzzFeed reporter who says that covering this beat is like spending the day “bathing in Internet garbage."
True, there's some satisfaction watching the charlatans Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl humiliated in 2018 when the press conference they hold to prove their accusation that special counsel Robert Mueller committed sexual assault goes disastrously awry. But it doesn't matter; as a New York Times reporter in attendance points out: By that time their work has been accomplished. They have turned credible journalists into accomplices by having them show up and cover the story and thus legitimizing it. Though debunked, their lies will spread online to the gullible millions.
“After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News" debuts on March 19 at 9 p.m. on HBO and on HBO NOW, HBO GO, partners' streaming platforms, and on HBO On Demand on March 20.

Texto completo: The city of Wuhan, China, where Covid-19 started, waited weeks before acknowledging human-to-human transmission and taking measures to control it. Wuhan thus experienced an out-of-control epidemic that overwhelmed the health care system. The city felt these effects for weeks after intense control measures were in place, as newly infected people got sick and required care.
Other cities in China watched Wuhan's experience and imposed strict controls at a much earlier stage in their epidemic: They closed schools, sharply limited social contact, and traced and isolated cases and contacts. These early interventions dramatically slowed transmission. No other Chinese city has repeated Wuhan's horrific experience so far. Now other hotspots of known transmission, including Iran and Italy, are tightly restricting social contact, but these interventions are coming late, and hospitals are teetering under the stress.
These experiences, and historical parallels, like the 1918 flu, show that early and sustained imposition of measures to limit social contact will slow the epidemic. This is desirable for many reasons — fewer total people get infected in a slowly moving epidemic; those who do get infected do so later, on average, so doctors will have learned more about how to care for the illness, and antiviral drugs may even be available. Most important in light of Wuhan's crushing experience, a controlled epidemic has a lower peak, reducing the strain on health systems. From the perspective of disease control, every effort should be made, as soon as possible, to slow the spread of the virus and flatten the epidemic curve. If these interventions are not sustained, spread will resume, but every action to slow it buys us some time and probably reduces the total size of the outbreak.
Many kinds of mitigation measures are needed immediately. Case-based interventions to isolate confirmed cases and trace and quarantine their contacts are already overwhelming some US health departments, consuming time and resources that could be better spent on implementing social distancing and trying to soften the blow of its effects. These case-by-case measures are unlikely to do much on their own when we know most cases are going undetected. Instead, we must focus on reducing social contacts in order to slow transmission, by keeping people at home and out of public spaces. Conventions, parades, sports events, and other large public gatherings that risk transmission should be canceled or postponed. Efforts to reduce contacts should focus on the most vulnerable (elderly and those with certain serious chronic medical conditions), but not be restricted to them, because all of us can become infected and transmit the virus, even without severe symptoms. Working from home, staying home when sick, hand-washing, covering coughs, and the like are all common-sense ways to reduce contacts and slow spread. Building ventilation should be improved wherever possible. The shameful lack of soap and hot water in many public school buildings needs to be fixed. Suspending public transportation, houses of worship, and other close quarters may soon be needed.
Many businesses and individuals are already canceling travel plans. This may be wise because travel involves close quarters with many people on planes and trains, and because much business travel revolves around attending large meetings. But it's wrongheaded at this stage to talk about “lockdowns" to prohibit travel to and from particular places where many cases have been found, as US government officials have done recently. Currently, we have little idea what locations in the United States are hotspots of transmission — testing has been so limited that we know about cases mainly after someone gets so sick that they are tested for Covid-19. For now, the hotspots in the United States are the places that have done the most testing.
One intervention where the way forward is less clear is school closings. School closings clearly hamper transmission of seasonal and pandemic flu; some evidence also exists for other respiratory viruses. Some districts in the United States are closing schools now. What role will this play in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19?
The data are limited and conflicting. Reports from China on over 44,000 cases suggested just 2.4 percent of confirmed cases were in children under 19. Korea, which has tested more widely, had twice that proportion, but still low case numbers in children. A study in Shenzhen, China, while smaller, found that children were just as likely to get infected as other age groups. It is clear that children have milder symptoms than adults, and it seems that studies that look harder, testing more and milder cases, find more cases among children. This suggests that children may play a role in transmission, perhaps less important than in flu, but still important. More research is desperately needed, but we may not have time to get compelling answers before decisions are needed. The decision on school closure will come down to a choice between two bad options.
Closing schools may be a major contribution to controlling the epidemic spread, but we can't be sure. Closing schools, however, has multiple costs — lost education, loss of essential workers, including medical and public health workers who need to care for their children if schools are closed, loss of school meals and mental health services, and other harms that will disproportionately hit the least advantaged.
The Biogen outbreak should help us realize that we are on the brink of experiencing a public health catastrophe. The examples of Wuhan, Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran should give us all a strong resolve to slow the epidemic before it is too late. Every intervention we try will be testing new waters, and evaluation is critical to make sure that, as we impose costs on society, we are getting the benefits of disease control. Just as important as when to act is when to let up on control measures. But we must act now.

Taiwan and the Virus; A hopeful example in public health.

Texto completo: Responding to the coronavirus is not cheap. Caitlin Ostroff, Joanne Chiu and Caitlin McCabe report in the Journal:
The U.S. stocks selloff that plunged the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a bear market continued at a furious pace Thursday as the coronavirus pandemic threatened to deeply harm global growth.
The S&P 500 shed more than 7% shortly after the opening bell, plunging the index into bear market territory and triggering a 15-minute halt in trading. The drop marked the second time this week that a rarely-used circuit breaker was triggered.
Stocks pared some of their earlier losses in afternoon trading after the Federal Reserve announced it will pump more $1.5 trillion into short-term funding markets.
But there is some good news. Across the philosophical spectrum and around the world, there seems to be an acknowledgment that Taiwan has responded well to the new threat. German government-backed broadcaster Deutsche Welle asks , "How has Taiwan kept its coronavirus infection rate so low?"
Liberty advocate Helen Raleigh of the Federalist is more or less the opposite of a public broadcaster. She writes, "What The Rest Of The World Can Learn From Taiwan's Success Containing Coronavirus." The apparent triumph in Taiwan is remarkable given its proximity to China and the large amount of air travel between them. According to Ms. Raleigh:
Taiwan hasn't experienced the need to cancel schools nor lock down major cities. At this critical period when the publicly feared coronavirus is amplifying in numbers worldwide, it's clear the Taiwanese government has done something right in its containment measures.
How did Taiwan do it? The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published recent findings crediting the Taiwanese government with recognizing the crisis early. Taiwan took swift and decisive actions, while Beijing and the World Health Organization (WHO) were busy downplaying the risks.
Some of Taiwan's actions may not be applicable at this stage, and some of its methods are bound to raise privacy concerns in the U.S. But its aggressive use of technology to identify and isolate people carrying the virus—and those most threatened by it—may help to inform the U.S. response. According to Stanford University's Dr. Jason Wang and colleagues:
COVID-19 occurred just before the Lunar New Year during which time millions of Chinese and Taiwanese were expected to travel for the holidays. Taiwan quickly mobilized and instituted specific approaches for case identification, containment, and resource allocation to protect the public health. Taiwan leveraged its national health insurance database and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics; it generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. It also used new technology, including QR code scanning and online reporting of travel history and health symptoms to classify travelers' infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days. Persons with low risk (no travel to level 3 alert areas) were sent a health declaration border pass via SMS (short message service) messaging to their phones for faster immigration clearance; those with higher risk (recent travel to level 3 alert areas) were quarantined at home and tracked through their mobile phone to ensure that they remained at home during the incubation period.
Moreover, Taiwan enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms (based on information from the National Health Insurance [NHI] database) who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19...
Deutsche Welle adds, "Taiwan's government introduced a travel ban on visitors from China, Hong Kong and Macau soon after the number of coronavirus cases began to rise in mainland China."
Taiwan's success is also bound to make some doctors question the value added by the World Health Organization, which has lately been excluding Taiwan to please the communist government in China.
A Journal editorial noted in February:
From 2009 to 2016, the World Health Organization allowed Taiwan to attend its annual policy meetings as a nonvoting observer and sometimes let its representatives participate in technical meetings. But at Beijing's behest, the WHO has given Taiwan the pariah treatment since Tsai Ing-wen was elected president in 2016. China's State Council said that Taiwan's absence from a key WHO meeting last year was "totally caused by the acts" of Ms. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party and its "separatist position of 'Taiwan independence.'"
The WHO has held two emergency meetings since the coronavirus outbreak. Taiwan wasn't permitted to attend, despite its proximity to China and its handful of confirmed cases.
When it comes to fighting disease without shutting down cities, here's hoping the U.S. will be as successful as Taiwan. Some fear that we will face a situation similar to Italy. Dr. Aaron Carroll warns in the New York Times:
A crucial thing to understand about the coronavirus threat — and it's playing out grimly in Italy — is the difference between the total number of people who might get sick and the number who might get sick at the same time. Our country has only 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. That's fewer than in Italy (3.2), China (4.3) and South Korea (12.3), all of which have had struggles. More important, there are only so many intensive care beds and ventilators.
On that score Niall McCarthy writes a somewhat more encouraging report in Forbes today:
According to a paper published in the Intensive Care Medicine journal utilizing 2012 data, Italy had 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 of its population that year while Germany had 29.2 ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants. A different paper published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information in 2015 states that capacity in the United States is even higher at 34.2 ICU beds per 100,000 people.
Fortunately the U.S. is also a younger country than Italy. Margherita Stancati reported on Monday in the Journal:
In Italy, which has the oldest population in the world after Japan, 58% of Covid-19 patients who died so far were over 80 years old, and a further 31% were in their 70s, according to the National Institute of Health, Italy's disease-control agency.
Ms. Stancati adds that the Italian government is buying thousands of new ventilators. It should also be noted that, like many socialized medical systems, Italy's system has a personnel challenge. According to the Journal report:
There aren't enough specialized doctors and nurses to staff intensive-care units. Intensive care wards across the country were already some 3,000 doctors short before the coronavirus outbreak, according to the union that represents them.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders took the lead in Spokane County on the second day of vote tallying in the presidential primary, but lost his statewide advantage to Joe Biden.
With at least 10,000 votes left to count in Spokane County, Sanders held a 431-vote edge on the former vice president after trailing Biden on Tuesday evening. Biden, however, amassed more of the statewide ballots counted Tuesday to take a roughly 15,000-vote advantage over Sanders, who handily won Washington's caucuses in 2016.
That's a 17,000-vote swing from Election Night, when Sanders held a 2,000-vote advantage. Biden has seen his support nationally swell as other high-profile candidates suspended their campaigns and endorsed him, including Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
The candidates are vying for 89 pledged delegates to the party's national convention in Milwaukee this summer, where a nominee will be formally chosen. Delegates will be awarded proportionally based not only on statewide results, but also within Congressional districts. Those totals won't be available until results are certified March 27.
Biden won the Idaho, Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi primaries Tuesday, posting a particularly strong showing in Mississippi. There, Sanders is in danger of failing to meet the 15% statewide threshold to receive any delegates. Sanders won 53% of the vote in North Dakota, and the edge in Washington's final delegate count remains up for grabs.
Sanders told national media he intended to debate Biden on Sunday in Arizona, but also admitted he was losing the "electability debate" to the former vice president.
Several American territories vote this week, and on Tuesday voters in the delegate-rich states of Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Ohio will weigh in.
A candidate will need 1,991 pledged delegates to wrap up the nomination, and the New York Times reported Wednesday that Biden had earned 864 delegates to Sanders' 710.

PEOPLE
The ripple effect of the new coronavirus on the entertainment industry reached late-night television and far beyond to the series "Survivor" in Fiji.
"The Tonight Show" and other late-night talk shows in New York announced Wednesday they will tape without audiences, while CBS said that production on the next season of "Survivor" was being postponed.
In a statement Wednesday, NBC said it was suspending live audiences for Jimmy Fallon's "Tonight Show" and "Late Night with Seth Meyers" starting Monday, citing the safety of guests and employees as the "top priority."
CBS announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" also will tape without an in-studio audience, as did Comedy Central's "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah" and HBO's "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver."
"For the past several weeks, 'The Late Show' producers have consulted daily to share information with other New York-based late night shows, who will also be moving forward without an audience," CBS said in a statement.
Also Wednesday, CBS said production on the 41st edition of "Survivor" has been postponed in response to the spread of the coronavirus. Filming was scheduled to begin later this month in Fiji, but CBS now says production will start on May 19.
Louis C.K. returns to sold-out performances
There were no protesters or picketers. Just roughly 1,800 people - couples on date nights, clusters of young men, boomer parents with their millennial kids - lined up on a downtown Washington, D.C., block, eager to watch Louis C.K. tell jokes.
Inside the Warner Theatre on Sunday, C.K. walked out in his familiar black T-shirt and jeans. He gently said hello and greeted the crowd. "How are ya? How was your  last couple of years?" he said, to laughs. "How was 2018 and 2019 for you guys? Anyone else get in global amounts of trouble?"
Then the #MeToo movement took off and the New York Times published allegations about C.K. He admitted that the rumors about him, the ones he'd denied for years, were true: He'd masturbated in front of female colleagues.
But not for everybody. C.K. may no longer be a celebrated auteur, but he still has an audience. He sold out two theater nights in D.C.
Unprompted, a dozen in the audience noted they liked how C.K. addressed the elephant in the room, but they mostly talked about how he delivered on their expectations.

A jazz-hands novel from Colum McCann Collage effect used to illustrate tragic deaths Book Review

Texto completo: Colum McCann's new novel, "Apeirogon," is based on an uplifting true story. It's about two fathers - Rami Elhanan, an Israeli, and Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian - who each lost a young daughter to senseless violence. They have become friends and work together, through an organization called Combatants for Peace, to bring the opposing sides together.
McCann takes their story and drops it to the ground, where it shatters. To read "Apeirogon" is to watch him pick up the shards. As befits a writer who ruminates about the nature of storytelling, there are 1,001 of these shards, each numbered, in an homage to "One Thousand and One Nights," the collection of Middle Eastern folk tales.
This is an early warning sign. It is possible to admire "One Thousand and One Nights" while having learned through hard experience that a writer who derives too much inspiration from it is generally one to avoid, unless what's desired is a self-inflicted intellectual glitter-bombing. Time magazine film critic Stephanie Zacharek, writing on Twitter, recently called "storytelling" a "jazz-hands word." "Apeirogon" is a jazz-hands novel.
In many of McCann's 1,001 shards, we follow Rami and Bassam in something like real time. They attend meetings, give lectures, worry about crossing border checkpoints. In others, we flash back to earlier points in their lives. From multiple angles, we witness the events that led to their daughters being killed. Rami and Bassam no longer want to silo their suffering. They want for their grandchildren what the narrator of Israeli writer David Grossman's novel "See Under: Love" wanted, "to live in this world from birth to death and know nothing of war." You sense you would like Rami and Bassam if you got to know them.
But we are not allowed to settle into the texture and nuance of their experience. We're evicted from the narrative on almost every page so that McCann can tweezer in arty and only vaguely relevant facts.
He's going for a collage effect. He'd like to chime with Shirley MacLaine in "The Apartment," who looks into a broken mirror and says to Jack Lemmon: "I like it that way. Makes me look the way I feel."
McCann's shards are set apart from one another on the page by a thumb's-width of white space. This trending method of organizing a novel (for example, Jenny Offill) is not yet insufferable but has a trap door: It exaggerates a writer's weaknesses.
Offill's weakness is that, despite her comic tone, her wit can fizzle. McCann's is that, even in his best novels, such as the National Book Award-winning "Let the Great World Spin," his work can be humorless and self-important.
"Apeirogon" - the title refers to a shape with a limitless number of sides - is so solemn, so certain of its own goodness and moral value, that it tips almost instantly over into camp, into corn. It's as if the author were gunning for the Paulo Coelho Chair in Maudlin Schlock.
In an author's note at the front of this novel, McCann writes: "We live our lives, suggested Rilke, in widening circles that reach out across the entire expanse." McCann has a gift for quoting others at their most flatulent: "The only interesting thing is to live, said Mitterand"; "Hertzl wrote: If you divide death by life, you will find a circle."
For added effect, McCann repeats lines he likes, such as the Mitterand quote, again and again.
McCann's numbered shards - they ascend from 1 to 500, then turn and begin to descend - offer structure in place of content. "Apeirogon" is not a meal but a table littered with ingredients: a paw of garlic, a frozen lamb shank, two potatoes, a big knob of celeriac, three peas.
When you insist on a lot of white space between paragraphs and sometimes between single sentences, and if your work is humid, the effect can unintentionally verge on the amusing. Each sentence has an apricot-colored scarf tied around its neck. And it's as if the reader has been given 10 seconds and a bong hit between each one; time to squint and nod and say, "So true."
As with Bob Geldof speaking of Ethiopian famine at the time of Live Aid, McCann's ardor is unmistakable. But his analysis of the predicaments that face the Middle East is not raw or original or sophisticated. His message is optimistic - we need to talk more, and understand each other's humanity - and banal.
Great writing, Walt Whitman wrote, is composed of words that are "whirled like chain-shot rocks." Enough rocks have been whirled in the Middle East. And this novel is only tossing around pillows.

Top reasons to read 'The Top 10 as We Hit Bottom' BOOK REVIEW

Texto completo: Since Ron Barrett illustrated the classic children's picture book "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" in 1978, the forecast for our world has become considerably more dire.
Fast-forward 42 years to "The Top 10 as We Hit Bottom," a darkly satirical but real collection of top 10 lists that highlight the predicament global warming and other impending catastrophes have put us into. The book has been researched and written by Jim Parry and illustrated by Barrett.
Although some might call this book a collection of "fake news," the lists are compiled and culled from respected authorities like NASA, the United Nations and the Union of Concerned Scientists. The creators think the heartwarming illustrations, to temper the harsh messages of the text, will have readers laughing their way all the way down in the race to the bottom.
The book's cover, reminiscent of the box for Screaming Yellow Zonkers (are you with me?), says the lists have been compiled by The Center for Impending Doom, for which Parry, voted Class Cynic of his high school graduating class, claims to be the founder.
The Top 10 may not solve any of these earthly issues, but can go a long way to increase awareness among the population. Among the topics of note: global warming, nuclear war, cyberwar, biowar, pandemics, earthquakes, tsunamis, supervolcanoes, blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes.
Pumped yet? OK: avalanches, landslides, wildfires, floods, droughts, famines, asteroids, alien attacks, solar storms, doomsdays past and future. There, feel better?
So here's 10 of the many Top 10 lists to whet your appetite for Earth's impending doom:
"Top 10 species we'll lose to climate change"
"Top 10 avalanches mostly caused by global warming"
"Top 10 climate change doubters"
"Top 10 times we almost had a nuclear war"
"Top 10 things that will happen when the Yellowstone Supervolcano erupts"
"Top 10 ways to try to stop an asteroid"
"Top 10 signs that the earth is about to be swallowed by a black hole"
"Top 10 ways a particle accelerator mishap could destroy the world"
"Top 10 end-of-world cults you can join now"
"Top 10 ways aliens could kill us all"
So why did Barrett, a legendary children's book illustrator, take on this project? "It's not a very long journey," he said. "The New York Times recently recommended 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' as one of the best books to teach children about climate change. It is, after all, a book about the weather gone awry. Unfortunately we have no toast boats to escape from becoming toast ourselves."
"I feel very strongly that the earth will become uninhabitable unless we do something to eliminate all carbon emissions by tomorrow morning. Yet Parry's meticulously researched book is about more than warming - it's all the ways forces in and out of our control threaten our existence."
The lists are more than just lists. Listen to Parry's introduction of the top species we'll lose to climate change: "The polar bear is the poster-creature of climate change victims, but these ten (on the list) are actually closer to extinction. One of them - a mosaic-tailed rat - is already gone. Oh, we don't care about losing a rat? Hey, just as rats leaving a sinking ship is a warning, maybe we should be warned."
The titles of some of the lists are enough to arouse curiosity, or at least make you read them a second time: "The Top 10 Steps by Which the Biggest Opportunity to Combat Global Warming Was Lost, 1979-1989." Let me see, where was I in 1979?
Or: "The Top 10 Ways the Universe Could - Tomorrow or 2,000 Billion Years From Now - End."
Among the Top 10 Quotes About the End of the World, here's one from Mark Twain: "When the end of the world comes, I want to be in Kentucky, because everything there happens 20 years after it happens anywhere else."
Wasn't life so much simpler when your only worry was whether it would be raining meatballs later in the afternoon?

Texto completo: When multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hired an army of staff members for his presidential campaign, he lavished them with salaries that were nearly double what other candidates were paying. His campaign also promised something rivals could not match: job security through the general election, even if he dropped out of the race.
But now, less than a week after Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, left the Democratic presidential race -- endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden and pledging to put his vast resources behind him -- hundreds of Bloomberg's field organizers and regional organizing directors around the country are suddenly without jobs, having received emails Monday that encouraged them to keep their campaign-issued electronics as a sort of severance payment.
In a series of conference calls Monday, campaign staff members outside battleground states learned that their work had ended and that they would be paid through the end of March, according to seven people who were on such calls. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements they had signed with the campaign, from which they were seeking to be released.
"We sincerely appreciate your commitment and dedication over the past few months!" read an email that the workers received, which was reviewed by The New York Times. "As a token of our appreciation, we are offering you the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone."
The email specified the value of those devices -- ranging from $1,400 to $1,700, depending on the model of the computer -- and noted that employees would be required to pay taxes on those amounts.
The former campaign workers -- at-will employees who said they had been promised employment through November in job interviews -- were asked in a survey to indicate if they wanted to be referred to another presidential campaign, and if they were open to moving to one of six states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
A spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign said in a statement Monday that the campaign had been clear about its intention to focus on those states as the field of primary candidates narrowed.
"As we've said over the course of the campaign, this election will come down to six battleground states," the statement said. "It's imperative that we invest there with staff and infrastructure. Staff who were working in non-battleground states and would like to learn about future opportunities in the battleground states are being asked to let us know so we can consider them for jobs there."
The former staff members, some of whom said they were consulting employment lawyers, said they had asked to be released from the nondisclosure agreements, calling it unfair to be unable to talk about their work for the campaign as they found themselves unemployed and searching for new jobs.
Some people had moved to new states for the campaign, receiving stipends to relocate for what they had expected would be nearly a year. On Monday, some of the affected staff members turned their organizing efforts inward, seeking to reach senior campaign aides who might have been involved in the decision.
In ramping up operations quickly after Bloomberg declared his candidacy last November, the campaign used pay as a powerful recruitment tool, assembling a legion of workers across the country and offering unusually high salaries. Field organizers were offered $6,000 a month, nearly twice the $3,500 that other campaigns paid.
Bloomberg campaign staff members said they were told they had job security, mitigating the risk that accompanies such work. Some said they had taken leaves of absence from jobs they were unable to reclaim until the end of the year. Some field organizers said they had turned down competing, full-time job offers in favor of working on Bloomberg's bid.
Over the course of his 14-week campaign, Bloomberg emphasized his commitment to unseating President Donald Trump and promised to support whoever won the Democratic nomination.
Last week, days before he exited the race, he specified that he planned to keep his "main field offices" open, regardless of the results on Super Tuesday.
Having won only American Samoa, Bloomberg dropped out of the race the next day, and his operation set about determining the legally complicated mechanics of how to redeploy his campaign in service of Biden's.
While nondisclosure agreements are standard on political campaigns -- helping to protect trade secrets like self-research and internal polling -- hush agreements have also been among the issues that dogged Bloomberg in the Democratic primary race.

Texto completo: 'The Power Notebooks'
By Katie Roiphe, 235 pages, Free Press, $27
To judge by Katie Roiphe's previous work, ambivalence and vulnerability aren't qualities that she holds in high esteem. But in "The Power Notebooks," she deigns to give them a try.
Ever since the 1993 publication of "The Morning After," in which a 25-year-old Roiphe derided "feminist preoccupations with rape and sexual harassment" on college campuses, she has taken care to position herself as a feminist of a particular kind: tough but not radical, assertive but not militant, cool but not cold.
A woman, in other words, who is consummately aware of the male gaze and finds it only empowering, never degrading. Her more polemical books extol danger, charisma, virility and bravado while ridiculing safety, tenderness, solidarity and weakness. In an essay for The New York Times Book Review 10 years ago, she wrote about how much she missed the "sexual adventuring" of novels by Philip Roth, Norman Mailer and John Updike; the roaring misogyny of their work was more forgivable than the tentative output of younger male novelists burdened by "convoluted, post-feminist second-guessing."
This new book, Roiphe says, is "like nothing else I have ever written." Instead of essays, she offers notebook entries, discrete blocks of text organized around themes such as "Insomnia," "Photographs" and "Twitter." The notebooks allow her to express the "confusion, self-contempt, conflict" that she tried to keep at bay in her published work. "I craved a kind of wandering not available to me in the increasingly rigid forms of my life," she writes. "I wanted a way out of my usual way of looking at things."
Despite her reputation for controversy, Roiphe has never been that formidable a polemicist; her perspective is too blinkered, her blind spots too obvious. At the level of the sentence, though, she's a skillful writer. Even in this book, without the ballast of a sustained argument, there's a deliberation in her pacing that keeps everything moving.
She wants to explore the subject of "women strong in public, weak in private." She's especially fascinated by the example of writers such as Simone de Beauvoir and Mary McCarthy -- women who projected indomitable personas on the page even as they were in thrall to men who could be monstrous. "Is there a particular kind of abjection that some of us are drawn to, participate in, possibly romanticize," Roiphe asks, "even though nothing about our external lives necessarily suggests it?"
For her, the answer is decidedly yes. Her first husband was emotionally abusive, even if Roiphe says that she's hesitant to use the term. Her current husband experienced sudden rages because of a Vicodin addiction that he kept hidden from her for months. She once dated a manipulative man she calls "the Claw," whose "brutality is, on a good day, part of his allure."
The best parts of the book are the ones in which Roiphe reconsiders her old positions, admitting how much they left out. At 15, she had what she calls a "relationship" with a rabbi in his 30s and spent years afterward trying "to wrangle power, to claim my active participation, to clamber for it." She now recognizes this was an elaborate defense mechanism, a "costly fiction" that elided her confusion by pretending she was in control.
Her newfound openness only goes so far. While Roiphe's empathetic imagination extends to men and to women such as Beauvoir, who were tormented by the men they loved, other women in this book aren't afforded the same depth of understanding. A female colleague at work is cast as a flattened caricature of a petty bully; a female friend gets gently mocked for her forthrightness and emotional candor, which Roiphe inexplicably characterizes as "her need to be protected."
Throughout her career, Roiphe has maintained a tortured relationship to victimhood, scornful of women who speak at Take Back the Night marches while also expressing utter bewilderment when others criticize her work. In "The Power Notebooks," she recalls being on the receiving end of a Twitter mob, getting called hateful names by people who were "angry about something they imagine might be in an essay I am writing in Harper's that hasn't yet come out." She became scared and irritable, unable to sleep for more than three hours a night.
The experience must have been awful, though her account is fastidiously curated, neglecting to mention that the "something they imagine might be in an essay I am writing" was the name of Moira Donegan, who anonymously started a Google spreadsheet of men in the media accused of sexual harassment and assault.
Two years ago, when all of this was happening, Roiphe gave a muddled account to the Times, saying she didn't know who created the list, even though the reporter obtained email exchanges suggesting otherwise. Roiphe then insisted that she wouldn't have named Donegan "without her approval." Here, in Roiphe's new book, Donegan's existence isn't acknowledged at all; instead the entire ordeal revolves around Katie Roiphe, a beleaguered truth teller under attack solely for her daring ideas.
So who is she writing for? I began to wonder if this book is Roiphe's attempt to be "relatable" -- to jump on the bandwagon of fragmented, diaristic writing by women that confesses to vulnerability and doubt. In 2020, ingratiating oneself to a shrinking cadre of male gatekeepers is no longer the shrewd strategy it once was. "The Power Notebooks" can be read as a power move.

Texto completo: Viral dance memes and dance challenges on TikTok largely bypass Green Bank, West Virginia. So do viral sensations like augmented reality filters on Snapchat and Instagram.
And when a Facebook fad had people all over the globe dumping ice water on their heads a few summers ago, Charity Warder, now a senior at Pocahontas County High School, was late to the game.
Sure, Charity has an iPhone, but she uses it mostly as a clock and a calculator. She makes phone calls from a landline, and she rarely texts her friends. Texting and driving? "It's not a thing here," she said.
When Charity wants to get online at home, she sits at her family's desktop computer, which has a broadband connection that is so sluggish, it takes minutes to load a YouTube video.
"We fight over the computer," said Charity, 18. "That's actually a thing here."
Welcome to Green Bank, population 143, where Wi-Fi is both unavailable and banned and where cellphone signals are nonexistent.
The near radio silence is a requirement for those living close to the town's most prominent and demanding resident, the Green Bank Observatory, home to the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope. To protect the sensitive equipment from interference, the federal government in 1958 established the National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000-square-mile area near the state's border with Virginia.
The observatory's telescope "could detect your phone on Saturn in airplane mode," states a sign outside its science center building, but is rendered much weaker if anyone uses electronics that emit radio waves. For those who live within 10 miles of the observatory, the limitations also include a ban on Bluetooth devices and microwaves, unless they are contained in a metal box, known as a Faraday cage, which blocks electromagnetic fields.
Nearly 15 million Americans live in sparsely populated communities where there is no broadband internet service at all, a stark digital divide across America between those with access to uber-fast connections and those with none.
But in Green Bank, where the restrictions are mandatory, the quiet zone has in many ways created a time warp in the mountainous region. Phone booths loom near barns and stand guard on rural roads. Paper maps are still common. Here, people are less distracted by the technologies that have come to dominate 21st-century American life.
At a time when nearly 60% of American teenagers say they have been bullied or harassed online, and studies have found links between social media use and teen mental health problems, the digital limitations around Green Bank have created a unique kind of modern childhood, providing a glimpse into what it means to grow up without the constant buzz of texting and social media.
The quiet, too, has given young people here a greater appreciation for fostering in-real-life connections, the great outdoors and personal privacy. Even teenagers who are able to use Wi-Fi at home -- in the quiet zone but outside its 10-mile core -- said they spend less time online than most people their ages, and those who have moved to the quiet zone said they have discovered a newfound sense of adventure.
Although Charity received an iPhone 6 for Christmas two years ago, she said she rarely looks at it. She makes plans with friends the old-fashioned way: on a landline or in person. After school, instead of being glued to social media, she usually goes running before tending to her family's goats, chickens and ducks. Then she typically makes dinner with her mother.
The family's computer is helpful for homework -- but not much else.
On a recent evening, Charity sat in the family's cozy living room, chatting with her boyfriend and parents. Undistracted by technology, they laughed and maintained eye contact, a domestic scene they recognize as somewhat rare.
"It kind of makes us old-school," said Charity. "My parents would kill me if I was staring at my phone and not listening to them."
This fall, Charity will leave the quiet zone to attend West Virginia Wesleyan College, a small school in Buckhannon with about 1,400 students. In some ways, it will feel like moving to a foreign country, where the routine modes of communication are unfamiliar.
Growing up, Charity has remained largely shielded from the glare of social media, despite having accounts on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram. Her school's cyberbullying seminars had felt irrelevant until an out-of-town basketball game during her freshman year, when a girl posted a video of Charity joking around in a bathroom.
"I just never thought someone would do something like that," Charity said. "People here aren't used to that stuff."
Charity's mother, Tonya Warder, has warned her daughter about the risks of technology, and has wondered how she will fare in college with widely available cellphone coverage and Wi-Fi.
"Communication is a dying art because kids don't talk," Warder said, adding that she appreciates how the lack of cellphone service has influenced the habits of youth in and around Green Bank. "Ours do because there's no alternative."
Still, the near radio silence has its downsides. If drivers hit a deer or their vehicles breakdown, they cannot call for help from their cellphones.
Then there is the slow internet, which has created a range of complications for students. Filling out applications for college scholarships has been "stressful," Charity said, "getting them to load, typing on them, waiting for them to save."
While the absence of cellphone coverage and limited Wi-Fi may be a point of pride for many here, the quiet zone has scared away some outsiders.
"We're related to people who tend not to come visit because the teenagers are stressed out too much about not being on wireless," said Dr. Karen O'Neil, the director of the observatory. On a recent afternoon, O'Neil stood in the observatory's basement, where several high school students were tinkering with a computerized robot.
"They don't care when they put down their phones," she said, nodding toward the students, who are members of an after-school competitive robotics team overseen by observatory staff.
The observatory has long worked to share its scientific and engineering expertise with local schools, a partnership that has paid off most recently with the announcement that the Green Bank Elementary-Middle School was one of 10 schools nationwide selected to host ham radio contacts with International Space Station crew members later this year.

Texto completo: One Tuesday night in October 2018, John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery store chain, was having dinner at Cipriani, an upscale Manhattan restaurant when his daughter, Andrea, walked in.
She was on a date with a man Catsimatidis didn't recognize. After the couple sat down at another table, Catsimatidis asked a waiter to go over and take a photo.
Catsimatidis then uploaded the picture to a facial recognition app, Clearview AI, on his phone. The startup behind the app has a database of billions of photos, scraped from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
Within seconds, Catsimatidis was viewing a collection of photos of the mystery man, along with the web addresses where they appeared: His daughter's date was a venture capitalist from San Francisco.
"I wanted to make sure he wasn't a charlatan," said Catsimatidis, who then texted the man's bio to his daughter.
Andrea Catsimatidis said she and her date had no idea how her father had identified him so quickly.
"I expect my dad to be able to do crazy things. He's very technologically savvy," she said. "My date was very surprised."
Clearview was unknown to the general public until this January, when The New York Times reported that the secretive startup had developed a breakthrough facial recognition system that was in use by hundreds of law enforcement agencies. The company quickly faced a backlash on multiple fronts.
Facebook, Google and other tech giants sent cease-and-desist letters.
Lawsuits were filed in Illinois, Vermont and Virginia, and the attorney general of New Jersey issued a moratorium against the app in that state.
In response to the criticism, Clearview published a "code of conduct," emphasizing in a blog post that its technology was "available only for law enforcement agencies and select security professionals to use as an investigative tool."
The post added: "We recognize that powerful tools always have the potential to be abused, regardless of who is using them, and we take the threat very seriously.
Accordingly, the Clearview app has built-in safeguards to ensure these trained professionals only use it for its intended purpose: to help identify the perpetrators and victims of crimes."
The Times, however, has identified multiple individuals with active access to Clearview's technology who are not law enforcement officials.
And for more than a year before the company became the subject of public scrutiny, the app had been freely used in the wild by the company's investors, clients and friends.
Those with Clearview logins used facial recognition at parties, on dates and at business gatherings, giving demonstrations of its power for fun or using it to identify people whose names they didn't know or couldn't recall.
"As part of the ordinary course of due diligence, we provided trial accounts to potential and current investors, and other strategic partners, so they could test the technology," said Hoan Ton-That, the company's co-founder.
John Catsimatidis first heard about Clearview from his friend Richard Schwartz, another founder of the company, who served as an aide to Rudy Giuliani when Giuliani was mayor of New York. Last summer, Catsimatidis ran a trial project with Clearview at one of his markets. The company used the system to identify known "shoplifters or people who had held up other stores," Catsimatidis said.
"People were stealing our Häagen-Dazs. It was a big problem," he said. He described Clearview as a "good system" that helped security personnel identify problem shoppers.
BuzzFeed News has reported that two other entities, a labor union and a real estate firm, also ran trials with a surveillance system developed by Clearview to flag individuals they deemed risky.
The publication also reported that Clearview's software has been used by Best Buy, Macy's, Kohl's, the National Basketball Association and numerous other organizations.
When Clearview first developed its facial recognition service in 2017, Ton-That and Schwartz were uncertain about who might pay for it, and they courted a range of clients including real estate firms, banks and retailers.
At the same time, Clearview was seeking outside investment. Many of the individuals the company approached got personal logins to the app.
Clearview received a seed investment round of about $1 million in July 2018.
Its backers included the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist David Scalzo and Hal Lambert, an investor in Texas who runs an exchange-traded fund with the ticker symbol "MAGA," which tracks companies that align with Republican politics.
"I have the app," Lambert said in an interview. "I've used it to talk about what we're doing in the space. I show it to friends of mine, potential investors.
"They thought it was amazing," he added. "They say, 'How do I get that?' And I say, 'You can't.' "
When Clearview was seeking its Series A round of funding, which was completed in 2019, the startup contacted a number of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures. Access to the app was offered as a perk, according to people familiar with the company's fundraising attempts.
Ton-That contends that Clearview is doing nothing wrong -- that his app simply replicates what other search engines do.
Instead of allowing internet users to search for people's public images by name, as one can do on Google, he said, Clearview allows them to do the search by uploading a face.
For now, it's a power that Clearview controls and can give out as it pleases.
In October, Clearview asked Nicholas Cassimatis, an expert on artificial intelligence, to help conduct an internal accuracy test. He did the work for free, he said, because he knew Ton-That socially. The test consisted of submitting the faces of 834 federal and state legislators. Clearview's algorithms accurately identified every one of the politicians.
After the test was complete, Cassimatis was allowed to keep Clearview's app on his phone. He said he had since run dozens of searches.
"I tested it in surprising places: smoky bars, dark places. And it worked every time," Cassimatis said. "It's road testing. I do it as a hobby. I ask people for permission. It's like a parlor trick. People like it."

Texto completo: Choosing a sofa can be a daunting proposition. From cocktail parties to catnaps, it has to meet a wide variety of demands. And it's probably the largest thing in the room, so it's not inconspicuous.
A sofa is "among the biggest and most important pieces of furniture in the living room or family room," said Estee Stanley, a Los Angeles-based interior designer.
Because it is so big, and so frequently used, a sofa is not the place to experiment with trendy designs, Stanley said: "Stick with what you love, and know that you will still love it in five to 10 years."
For different people, that means different things.
"A single guy might want to have the deepest, comfiest sofa," Stanley said, "so all his friends can huddle together and watch football."
But what if you have children? "A family of four might want it to be classic," she said, "but not so precious that they have to worry when their kid smears chicken salad on it."
* How long should a sofa be? Somewhere between 7 and 9 feet is usually ideal for seating three or four people, Stanley said, although she sometimes goes longer with curved sofas.
* Should it be on legs or not? It depends on the room, Stanley said, but "I love legs, so it doesn't look as much like one big piece."
* Which upholstery is best if you have children? Stanley sometimes uses outdoor-grade fabric from companies like Perennials and Sunbrella on indoor sofas. "My clients can't even tell the difference," she said. And when spills happen, "they can just wipe it down."

Microsoft warfare on malware

Texto completo: Microsoft organized 35 nations on Tuesday to take down one of the world's largest botnets -- malware that secretly seizes control of millions of computers around the globe. It was an unusual disruption of an internet criminal group because it was carried out by a company, not a government.
The action, eight years in the making, was aimed at a criminal group called Necurs, believed to be based in Russia. Microsoft employees had long tracked the group as it infected 9 million computers around the world, hijacking them to send spam emails intended to defraud unsuspecting victims. The group also mounted stock market scams and spread ransomware, which locks up a computer until the owner pays a fee.
Over the past year, Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit has been quietly lining up support from legal authorities in countries around the world, convincing them that the group had seized computers in their territories to conduct future attacks.
"It's a highway out there that is used only by criminals," Amy Hogan-Burney, the general manager of the Digital Crimes Unit and a former FBI lawyer, said Tuesday. "And the idea that we would allow those to keep existing makes no sense. We have to dismantle the infrastructure."
The team struck Tuesday, from an eerily empty Microsoft campus. Tens of thousands of workers had been ordered to stay home because the area near the headquarters in Redmond, Washington, has been a hot spot for the coronavirus. But taking down a botnet, the company concluded, was not a work-from-home task.
After cleansing the Digital Crimes Unit's command center to eliminate any live viruses, a small team of Microsoft workers gathered in a conference room at 7 a.m., flipped on their laptops and began coordinating action against another kind of global infection.
As soon as a federal court order against the Necurs network was unsealed, they began prearranged calls with authorities and network providers around the world to strike Necurs at once, cutting off its connections to computers around the globe.
"Was Mongolia hit? I think it was in the court order," one Microsoft employee asked. There was debate about Somalia -- "a very last-minute win," another noted -- and discussion of the fact that Nevis, the Caribbean island, was both the birthplace of Alexander Hamilton and an unwitting host for a small element of the botnet.
"Tajikistan?" one person in the room asked, looking for it to turn green on a map overhead, indicating that the botnet had been neutralized there. "No joy yet."
Rapidly, they took over or froze 6 million domain names that Necurs was using or had inventoried for future attacks. Necurs had created an algorithm to spawn millions of new domains, often with deceptive names, for future use against unsuspecting victims. Microsoft engineers had cracked the code.
By Tuesday's end, there was satisfaction that, for the 18th time in 10 years, Microsoft had taken down a digital criminal operation.
Microsoft executives acknowledged that this was a game of whack-a-mole, and that the creators of Necurs and groups like it would be back.
"The cybercriminals are incredibly agile," said Tom Burt, the executive who leads Microsoft's security and trust operations, "and they come back more sophisticated, more complex. It is an ultimate cat-and-mouse game."

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. 'My Dark Vanessa' by Kate Elizabeth Russell (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: When she was 15, Vanessa had a sexual relationship with her 42-year-old English teacher. At the time, she was thrilled by what she thought was a consensual romance. Years later, that same teacher is accused of sexual abuse by a former student. Does Vanessa remain silent and hold on to that illusion, or does she face the ugly truth of her first love?
The buzz: "Russell offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement..." says a review in Publishers Weekly.
2. 'The Mirror & the Light' by Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt & Co., fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The final book in Mantel's historical trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell in the court of King Henry VIII.
The buzz: The publisher has kept a tight lid on this one, but the early reviews are rapturous. "With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of," says a review in The Guardian.
3. 'MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman' by Ben Hubbard (Tim Duggan Books, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: The Beirut bureau chief for the New York Times paints a gripping portrait of the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, the mysterious and powerful young Saudi Arabian prince who ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The buzz: "A chilling look at the ascent of the current young prince of Saudi Arabia to first-in-line to succession," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
4. 'A Good Neighborhood' by Therese Anne Fowler's (St. Martin's Press, fiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: Two families are at odds in the tight-knit North Carolina community of Oak Knoll. Valerie Alston-Hold, a black professor with a musically gifted, biracial son, objects when her neighbors, the nouveau riche white family, the Whitmans, raze the lot next door to build a showplace. Then their teenagers fall in love.
The buzz: "A riveting, potentially redemptive story of modern American suburbia that reads almost like an ancient Greek tragedy," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
5. 'Recollections of My Nonexistence' by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday) What it's about: A portrait of the artist as a young woman. In her new memoir, Solnit reflects on her growth as a writer, feminist and activist in 1980s San Francisco, and on finding her voice in a society that prefers women to pipe down.
The buzz: A starred review in Kirkus Reviews calls it "a perceptive, radiant portrait of a writer of indelible consequence."

Texto completo: The PNC Broadway in Louisville series is announcing a landmark season for 2020-21, one that will be defined by the best of Broadway and the return of one of the most popular shows of all time.
The cultural phenomenon that is "Hamilton" is headed back to the Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts, 501 W. Main St., for the upcoming season. The 11 Tony Award-winning show will run February 9-28.
"'Hamilton' is such a rich and fast-paced production that I can honestly say I enjoyed it, even more, the second time I saw it," said Leslie Broecker, president of PNC Broadway in Louisville. "Every piece of it on a return trip is better."
Also heading to Louisville for the 2020-21 season is "Mean Girls," "To Kill a Mockingbird," "Waitress," "Cats," "Tootsie," and "Ain't Too Proud." The new season goes on sale Thursday at 6 a.m and includes a blend of hot premieres straight from Broadway and "asked for" returns.
"We're especially pleased to be able to bring 'Waitress' back to the Kentucky Center after having to cancel its 2018 run because of the fire at the Kentucky Center," said Broecker.
The entire new season is a diverse mix of performances great for a date night, family shows and traditional Broadway musicals.
"I am always looking for a well-rounded package that has something for everyone but also lots of little surprises for people to grab onto," said Broecker. "I am hard-pressed to say if there is a favorite for me because everything show is so strong."
One thing she is especially excited about is the February run of "Hamilton." Because "Hamilton" returns for the 2020-21 season during the school year, Broecker is excited to bring in an educational component during the show's run through the nonprofit Louisville Theatrical Association.
"We are looking forward to introducing more youth to Broadway theatre in the upcoming season and, as always, can't wait to make a difference in the lives of area students and future theatre-lovers," Broecker said.
Something else Broecker said is sure to delight audiences is "Tootsie."
"I think this will be the biggest surprise to audience members," said Broecker. "People will walk in thinking they know what they are getting but really they won't because it's so wonderfully updated for Broadway."
Here's everything you need to know about the PNC Broadway in Louisville 2020-21 season:
'Mean Girls' WHAT: Direct from Broadway, "Mean Girls" takes the audience back to high school where a naïve newbie falls prey to a trio of lionized frenemies and learns the hard way that you can't cross a Queen Bee without getting stung.
The musical is from an award-winning creative team, including book writer Tina Fey ("30 Rock"), composer Jeff Richmond ("Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"), lyricist Nell Benjamin ("Legally Blonde") and director Casey Nicholaw ("The Book of Mormon").
WHEN: Nov. 10-15
'To Kill a Mockingbird' WHAT: The most successful American play in Broadway history, "To Kill A Mockingbird" is Academy Award winner Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork.
WHEN: Dec. 1-6
'Waitress' WHAT: This show is a recipe for happiness. It's an uplifting and hilarious musical that features original music and lyrics by Grammy Award winner Sara Bareilles.
"Waitress," tells the story of Jenna, a food server and expert pie-maker who dreams of a way out of her small town and rocky marriage. Pouring her heart into her pies, she crafts desserts that mirror her topsy-turvy life such as "The Key (Lime) to Happiness Pie" and "Betrayed By My Eggs Pie." When a baking contest in a nearby county — and a satisfying encounter with someone new — show Jenna a chance at a fresh start, she must find the courage to seize it. Change is on the menu, as long as Jenna can write her own perfectly personal recipe for happiness.
WHEN: Jan. 5-10, 2021
'Hamilton' WHAT: Alexander Hamilton, a primary architect of the United States of America, was an immigrant. Enough said. Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical uses hip-hop, soul, jazz, blues and even Broadway-style musical numbers to turn "Hamilton" into one of Broadway's biggest shows in its history.
Winner of 11 Tony Awards, "Hamilton" has created a revolutionary moment in theatre as a musical that has had a profound impact on culture, politics and education.
WHEN: Feb. 9-28, 2021
'CATS' WHAT: The record-breaking musical spectacular by Andrew Lloyd Webber arrives in Louisville with new choreography, lighting and sound to tell the story of one magical night when an extraordinary tribe of cats gathers for its annual ball to rejoice and decide which cat will be reborn.
The original score by Webber ("The Phantom of the Opera," "School of Rock," "Sunset Boulevard"), original scenic and costume design by John Napier ("Les Misérables"), all-new lighting design by Natasha Katz ("Aladdin") and new choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler ("Hamilton") make this a production a new generation.
WHEN: March 16-21, 2021
'Tootsie' WHAT: "Tootsie" tells the story of Michael Dorsey, a talented but difficult actor who struggles to find work until one show-stopping act of desperation lands him the role of a lifetime.
Featuring a hilarious Tony-winning book by Robert Horn and an outrageously clever score by 2018 Tony winner David Yazbek ("The Band's Visit," "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"), "Tootsie" is packed with punchlines as the New York Times say it's "a joyful delight."
WHEN: June 8-13, 2021
'Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of The Temptations' WHAT: A smash hit on Broadway, "Ain't Too Proud" is the electrifying musical that follows The Temptations' extraordinary journey from the streets of Detroit to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
The winner of the 2019 Tony Award for Best Choreography, it's a story of brotherhood, family, loyalty, and betrayal during a decade of civil unrest in America. Set to the beat of the group's hits, including "My Girl," "Just My Imagination," "Get Ready," "Papa Was a Rolling Stone," the musical tells the story of the legendary quintet that Billboard Magazine named the greatest R&B group of all time.
WHEN: July 27-Aug. 1

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Pete Buttigieg has a new gig. At least for one night.
The former presidential candidate will be guest hosting "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on Thursday, he announced Monday.
Guests will include Patrick Stewart.
"Very excited about that," Buttigieg said on NBC's "Today Show."
Buttigieg suspended his presidential campaign on March 1 and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden the next day.
Buttigieg said he is traveling the country, thanking supporters, before getting some time away with his husband, Chasten.
"Then we'll come back and I'll make myself useful in new ways," he said on NBC. "But we're going to have some fun first."
The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, got a standing ovation when he and Chasten attended a performance of "The Intercept" in New York City on Sunday.
Buttigieg isn't the only former presidential candidate enjoying himself since leaving the race.
Three days after ending her campaign last week, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was on Saturday Night Live, appearing with Kate McKinnon, the cast member who portrayed her.
Buttigieg, who regularly tussled with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at the Democratic debates, was asked if she would be one of his guests on "Jimmy Kimmel Live."
"I'm hoping to catch up with her soon," he responded.
Klobuchar recently told The New York Times that she wrote Buttigieg "a nice note" after a withdrew from the race and they talked the next day.
Besides doing what he can to help Biden get elected, Buttigieg has said he will get involved in down ballot races. He told supporters last week there are a lot of diverse leaders from a new generation whose contests will decide what the next president will be able to achieve and what will happen in state governments
While it was painful to come to terms with the fact that there was no path for him to get the nomination and he should withdraw, Buttigieg said there are benefits to no longer being hyperfocused on one thing.
"It's nice," he said, "to be able to zoom out and just come back at life."
Pete Buttigieg isn't the only ex-presidential candidate enjoying life after the race.

Trump's response to COVID-19 is irresponsible

Texto completo: During a routine checkup at my doctor's office not long ago, he asked how concerned I was about the coronavirus. Not very, I replied, adding that seeing it dominate the news all the time made my eyes glaze over. There were no cases of COVID-19 in Iowa, after all.
My doctor tried to convince me it would likely reach here and could be more serious than some of us realize, especially to older folks and those with compromised immune systems. Yet even as Italy has quarantined millions and Kentucky declared a state of emergency after only one confirmed case, a majority of Iowans, like me, haven't taken the virus seriously enough to alter plans (other than the 61% who told pollsters they're doing more hand-washing). And even as family and friends were canceling trips still months away and Allegiant was offering free flight changes to anyone concerned, America's head of state was pretty relaxed about the whole thing.
That is, until the stock market started falling in response. Traders may not be medical experts but they know what economic trends to anticipate. After the first coronavirus-related plunge, President Donald Trump called for tax cuts (something he likes anyway) and an interest rate cut. The latter happened, though it's unlikely to motivate someone who's bedridden to go buy a new home or car. When the stock market had its worst fall since 2008, the Dow Jones average losing more than 2,000 points in one day, Trump said, "I'm not concerned at all."
On Monday, Iowa's governor declared a state of emergency, telling people not to panic but to wash their hands a lot. At least eight other states made that declaration sooner, enabling state agencies to put funds into containing or preventing the illness, which has hit 110,000 people worldwide, more than 600 in the U.S., and resulted in 4,000 deaths globally. No doubt those numbers will have increased by the time you read this.
How concerned the public should be is frankly not yet knowable. This is new. But compared with other countries — not including individual states that have been proactive — America's response has been sluggish. And we haven't been given full and accurate information.
Trump has said people are overreacting, and tweeted that more die from the flu than the coronavirus: "Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on." But there's a vaccine for the flu; there isn't one for this coronavirus. And while the worldwide death rate from COVID-19 is estimated, for now, to be 3.4%, it is 0.1% for the flu.
At a news conference with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last Friday, as his Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, was addressing the shortage of test kits, Trump interrupted to say, "Anybody, right now and yesterday, that needs a test gets a test. They're there, they have the tests, and the tests are beautiful."
That was the day after his point person on the disease, Vice President Mike Pence, had said there aren't enough to meet the demand. New York state is actually making its own tests for that reason. The criteria for getting tested has been so strict because of the shortage that the first person to contract COVID-19 didn't get tested for four days in a California hospital.
Now the Associated Press is reporting that CDC officials wanted to warn older people and those in fragile health not to go on commercial flights, but the White House said no. The White House has denied it.
The director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease was scolded for warning on Feb. 25 that the coronavirus was likely to spread in the United States, and that "this could be bad." Dr. Nancy Messonnier came under fire from the administration for that and has since toned down her advisories, according to the New York Times. Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, described as the country's top expert on infectious diseases, has to clear his interviews first with the White House, while Pence, who has no medical background, is in charge of talking about the coronavirus. Still, the president has contradicted both of them to put a happier face on things.
But that's apparently OK, because in Trump's view, he's got the science gene. At the CDC news conference, he said his uncle taught at MIT and was a "great supergenius," implying that gives him some medical aptitude. Not that it matters but his uncle, John G. Trump, taught electrical engineering.
So as the CDC tells vulnerable people to avoid crowds, Grinnell College tells students not to return to campus after spring break, the nursing home industry urges folks not to pay social calls at nursing homes, and New York has called in the National Guard to create a containment zone around the suburb of New Rochelle, Trump plans a rally and goes around shaking hands.
The lesson here? Take your medical advice from medical experts — even when the president's answers might make you feel calmer.
If you want to feel and act better, here's something worth doing, courtesy of my heritage: Avoid shaking hands by adopting the Indian style of greeting. Put your hands together in front of your chest as if in prayer, bow and say "Namaste." Translation: My soul greets your soul.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Don't expand pharmacists' scope amid virus threat
Florida's legislative session is about to end with one measure being debated that will have a dangerous impact on treating Floridians who may, or may not, be infected with the coronavirus.
SB 714 by Sen. Travis Hutson (R-Palm Coast) and HB 389 by Rep. Tyler Sirois (R-Merritt Island) have dramatically expanded the responsibilities of pharmacists to test, diagnose and treat people who walk into not only their local pharmacy, but now Florida's larger retail and grocery establishments such as CVS, Publix, Walgreens and Walmart - where non-symptomatic people come to shop for food and necessities for their families.
A recent New York Times article found that pharmacists are overwhelmed with the responsibilities that they have right now, expanded responsibilities, such as testing, diagnosing, and treating for influenza and more will only increase the risk of mistakes and misdiagnoses.
Now is not the time to direct patients who are unsure if they have the flu, coronavirus, or a sinus infection into the public domain.

Look at 'active surveillance' Not to be confused with 'watchful waiting,' this routine-monitoring approach could reduce need for radical treatment of prostate cancer

Texto completo: Howard Wolinsky is a medical journalist in Flossmoor, Illinois, who knows better than to go forward with potentially life-changing surgery without first seeking a second opinion.
Nine years ago, at age 63, when a PSA blood test followed by a biopsy revealed cancer in Wolinsky's prostate gland, the diagnosing urologist said he could operate to remove the offending organ the following week.
Not so fast, Wolinsky thought, knowing this was not a minor operation and one that often left men temporarily or permanently impotent, incontinent or both. So before having surgery Wolinsky consulted Dr. Scott Eggener, a University of Chicago urologist, who reviewed the test results and proposed an alternative strategy called "active surveillance."
Not to be confused with "watchful waiting," active surveillance is not a do-nothing approach. Rather, patients are routinely monitored and referred for surgery or radiation therapy only if their cancer begins to grow or show molecular signs of aggression.
Current estimates are that about half of men found to have prostate cancer could avoid radical treatment and its potential side effects if they were willing to live with having a cancer, albeit a seemingly benign one, in their bodies.
These are men whose cancer is deemed, based on its biological characteristics, to be low risk in terms of progressing to a potentially life-threatening state.
Only if periodic exams reveal that a man's cancer is shown to be progressing to a more aggressive state would more radical treatment be considered. For men who choose active surveillance, Eggener said, this generally affects about 5% annually for the first five to 10 years.
Other reasons for abandoning active surveillance and undergoing radical treatment include the patients' growing anxiety about living with cancer and pressure from family members, and sometimes even from their doctors to "get it out," clinicians report.
Watchful waiting, which involves little or no monitoring, is still sometimes suggested but mainly reserved for men with a limited life expectancy for other reasons or those whose health status makes surgery inadvisable.
Based on his PSA of less than 4 and a Gleason score of 6, Wolinsky said, "Dr. Eggener told me, 'You're the perfect candidate - the poster child for active surveillance.' "
The Gleason score is a measure of the cancer's aggressiveness, and a composite score of less than 7 is generally deemed low-risk disease.
So starting in 2010, Wolinsky had a PSA test and digital rectal exam every six months and an annual biopsy of the prostate, which was eventually lengthened to every three years. It's now been four years since the last biopsy, and chances are, unless a worrisome rise in the PSA occurs and other tests indicate an aggressive cancer, he may never need another.
Given the now rapidly changing methods of monitoring and diagnosing the lethality of prostate cancer, it behooves every man told he has cancer in this gland to explore the most currently available management options before deciding on treatment. There are now even support groups to help reassure men with a low-risk cancer who choose active surveillance.
"The field is on fire," said Dr. Laurence Klotz, a leading expert on urological cancer and pioneer of active surveillance.
"Within a few years, we'll have urine and blood tests that are so reliable we'll know which men don't even need a biopsy. Instead of a biopsy, there are now at least five biomarkers and more being developed that can be used as an initial test."
Even the process of biopsy has changed.
For decades, when a possible cancer was suspected based on the PSA test or digital rectal exam, doctors blindly took 12 core samples from the prostate to search for a malignancy. Now an MRI can be done first and a biopsy performed only if and when a potentially serious lesion is revealed. High-resolution ultrasound may even become a simpler and less expensive alternative to an MRI, Klotz said.
To avoid the need for a biopsy, Klotz is leading a large Canadian clinical trial, called Precise, to determine if an MRI is sufficiently accurate in detecting dangerous cancers and distinguishing them from harmless ones. He estimates, based on early data, that as many as 250,000 men a year in Canada and the United States could avoid unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to identify clinically significant cancers.
This approach results in the diagnosis of many fewer indolent cancers that would most likely never threaten a man's life, said Klotz, a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto.
"With an MRI, we find fewer of these low-grade cancers, and fewer men will be overtreated," he said.
If Eggener had his way, he would not even call it cancer for men with a Gleason score of 6 or lower because "it fails to meet the clinical definition of cancer: the ability to cause symptoms, metastasize or lead to death," he wrote in an email. "Removing the cancer label has been done in other cancers, most notably a subtype of thyroid and bladder cancers. I predict this will eventually happen for Gleason 6 prostate cancer and be reason for celebration."

Texto completo: When multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hired an army of staff members for his presidential campaign, he lavished them with salaries that were nearly double what other candidates were paying. His campaign also promised something rivals could not match: job security through the general election, even if he dropped out of the race.
But now, less than a week after Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, left the Democratic presidential race - endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden and pledging to put his vast resources behind him - hundreds of Bloomberg's field organizers and regional organizing directors around the country are suddenly without jobs, having received emails Monday that encouraged them to keep their campaign-issued electronics as a sort of severance payment.
In a series of conference calls Monday, campaign staff members outside battleground states learned that their work had ended and that they would be paid through the end of March, according to seven people who were on such calls. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements they had signed with the campaign, from which they were seeking to be released.
"We sincerely appreciate your commitment and dedication over the past few months!" read an email that the workers received, which was reviewed by The New York Times. "As a token of our appreciation, we are offering you the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone."
The email specified the value of those devices - ranging from $1,400 to $1,700, depending on the model of the computer - and noted that employees would be required to pay taxes on those amounts.
The former campaign workers - at-will employees who said they had been promised employment through November in job interviews - were asked in a survey to indicate if they wanted to be referred to another presidential campaign, and if they were open to moving to one of six states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
A spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign said in a statement Monday that the campaign had been clear about its intention to focus on those states as the field of primary candidates narrowed.
"As we've said over the course of the campaign, this election will come down to six battleground states," the statement said. "It's imperative that we invest there with staff and infrastructure. Staff who were working in non-battleground states and would like to learn about future opportunities in the battleground states are being asked to let us know so we can consider them for jobs there."
The former staff members, some of whom said they were consulting employment lawyers, said they had asked to be released from the nondisclosure agreements, calling it unfair to be unable to talk about their work for the campaign as they found themselves unemployed and searching for new jobs.
Some people had moved to new states for the campaign, receiving stipends to relocate for what they had expected would be nearly a year.
On Monday, some of the affected staff members turned their organizing efforts inward, seeking to reach senior campaign aides who might have been involved in the decision.
In ramping up operations quickly after Bloomberg declared his candidacy last November, the campaign used pay as a powerful recruitment tool, assembling a legion of workers across the country and offering unusually high salaries. Field organizers were offered $6,000 a month, nearly twice the $3,500 that other campaigns paid.
Bloomberg campaign staff members said they were told they had job security, mitigating the risk that accompanies such work. Some said they had taken leaves of absence from jobs they were unable to reclaim until the end of the year. Some field organizers said they had turned down competing, full-time job offers in favor of working on Bloomberg's bid.
Over the course of his 14-week campaign, Bloomberg emphasized his commitment to unseating President Donald Trump and promised to support whoever won the Democratic nomination. Last week, days before he exited the race, he specified that he planned to keep his "main field offices" open, regardless of the results on Super Tuesday.
Having won only American Samoa, Bloomberg dropped out of the race the next day, and his operation set about determining the legally complicated mechanics of how to redeploy his campaign in service of Biden's.
While nondisclosure agreements are standard on political campaigns - helping to protect trade secrets like self-research and internal polling - hush agreements have also been among the issues that dogged Bloomberg in the Democratic primary race.

Texto completo: Last month, our Hot List — a monthly roundup featuring of-the-moment restaurants — included Brunch, a new breakfast, brunch and lunch spot in Red Bank; the reinvented Point Lobster Bar & Grill, born from the union of Europa South and Point Lobster Company; and the incredibly popular The Butcher's Block in Long Branch, where you can't get a table on a Saturday night until late May.
This month, we are highlighting a seasonal dessert shop back for another season, a new pizzeria from a New Jersey native known around the world, and a 40-seat spot making comfort food from scratch.
Strollo's Lighthouse, Long Branch and Red Bank Is Strollo's new? Not at all. The Italian ice shop got its start in the 1930s, when owner Jimmy Callano's great-uncle, Tony Strollo, sold his lemon-flavored ice – along with meatball and sausage sandwiches and hot dogs – from a bus along the Long Branch beachfront.
Fast forward 40 years to when Strollo's son, Ray, opened the first storefront and began making his father's recipe in a soft-serve machine, which makes for a lighter version of Italian ice.
He introduced flavors like orange, cherry and chocolate to the traditional lemon, and today there are six Strollo's Lighthouse locations serving more than two dozen flavors.
What to try: Peanut butter and chocolate Italian ice. Need we say more?
Why it's hot: After a long winter hiatus, the Red Bank and Long Branch stores opened for the season on March 6. The Middletown, Point Pleasant Beach and Oceanport locations will reopen in the coming months.
Go: 250 Ocean Ave. and 69 Brighton Ave. in Long Branch and 64 North Bridge Ave. in Red Bank;
732-229-1222; strolloslighthouse.com.
Velo Eatery, Toms River A gem hidden in plain sight, Jennifer Klotzkin and Matthew Grote's restaurant opened six years ago in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it strip mall on busy Route 9. But their ever-changing menu, shaped by Grote, a graduate of Johnson and Wales University's culinary program, revolves around fresh seafood and comfort dishes and is well worth the U-turn.
What to try: Start with the New England Clam Chowder – Grote worked in Boston area restaurants for more than a decade, including one owned by legendary New England chef Jasper White.
Then onto the specials: Lobster Grilled Cheese with Boardwalk Fries, Crab Cake with Sweet Potato Corn Succotash, or a Lobster Roll with Tarragon Aioli, capped by a slice of Cookies and Cream Cheesecake or Yuzu-Jackfruit Pie.
Why it's hot: Nearly everything is homemade at this dinner-only restaurant, which is open Wednesdays through Saturdays.
Go: 1616 Route 9;

Una Pizza Napoletana, Atlantic Highlands You may have heard, but something pretty big happened at the Bayshore last month.
Anthony Mangieri, a Jersey Shore pizza prodigy who began perfecting his pillowy, slightly charred pizzas at Una Pizza Napoletana in Point Pleasant Beach in the late 1990s, later went on to bigger things in the Big Apple.
But as he told The Asbury Park Press last year, "my plan was always to end up back in New Jersey and do what I love in the place that I love."
Una Pizza Napoletana opened Feb. 28.
What to try: Don't ask for slices, as Mangieri only sells whole pies. There's the Marinara, with San Marzano tomatoes, wild oregano, garlic, basil, Sicilian sea salt and olive oil, and the Bianca, made with Buffalo mozzarella. The Apollonia, a specialty pizza served on Saturdays, has salami, egg and mozzarella, and Sundays are for Mangieri's choice.
Why it's hot: It's not every day that a chef who makes what New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells calls "the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs" opens at the Shore. Una Pizza Napoletana represents Mangieri's return to his roots, and we're happy he's back.
A tip: Get there early. As the restaurant's website proclaims, Una Pizza Napoletana is open from 5 p.m. until Mangieri runs out of dough.
Go: 91A First Ave.; unapizza.com. Also at 175 Orchard St. in New York; 646-692-3475.

Texto completo: Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann has filed lawsuits against five national media outlets accusing them of defamation.
Sandmann became part of a social media firestorm in January 2019 when he was filmed with Native American activist Nathan Phillips in Washington D.C.
The clip that went viral shows Sandmann and Phillips standing face-to-face in a crowd. Phillips plays a drum and sings.
The situation unfolded after the March for Life, which Sandmann and his classmates attended. Phillips was attending the Indigenous Peoples March.
On Monday, Sandmann sued the ABC News, CBS News, the New York Times, Gannett and Rolling Stone.
Gannett is the parent company of The Enquirer.
These are just the latest lawsuits stemming from the incident on the National Mall. Sandmann sued CNN, NBC and the Washington Post in the first half of 2019.
The NBC and Washington Post lawsuits are still working their way through U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Kentucky, where the new suits were filed.
CNN reached an out-of-court settlement with Sandmann. The details of that settlement are not public.
The new lawsuits make similar arguments to the previous ones.
According to the lawsuit, Sandmann and his lawyers accuse the media outlets of publishing false and defamatory reports that cast Sandmann in a negative light, which brought public ire and threats upon Sandmann and his family.
Sandmann also states the media outlets relied on narrative from the "demonstrably unreliable" Phillips.
Sandmann is seeking punitive and compensatory damages from all the media outlets.
$275 million from NBC
$250 million from the Washington Post
$195 million Gannett
$95 million from ABC News
$65 million from the New York Times
$60 million from CBS News
$35 million from Rolling Stone
This brings the total amount of damages sought in the lawsuits – not including the undisclosed CNN settlement – to $975 million.

Crossroads Church leverages donations to wipe out $46.5 million in medical debt

Texto completo: Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing.
He spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his Nov. 23 sermon, entitled "The Marks of Multiplication." Tome said members of the congregation could text "MULTIPLY" to 313131 to help "free others from medical debt," but insisted the campaign was not a challenge.
Just an awareness.
It was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity.
"When we are in debt, a sin debt to God, we can't get our way out of the sin debt to God," he said during the sermon. "Jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt, so we never have to worry about God hurting us for our sin."
Crossroads could give to free others' debt, too, he said. And for every dollar they raised, Crossroad's partner RIP Medical Debt would leverage that dollar to abolish $100 in medical debt, therefore multiplying the church's impact.
Within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.
Over $42 million of those funds came back to Ohio families.
"Most of it probably that weekend," said Crossroads director of marketing Brennan Hill. "Cuz I think most people, if I had to guess, were doing it in real time. You know, if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in."
Church officials announced the impact of their campaign on Feb. 23.
Most of the funds came back to Ohio families since the church is based out of the Cincinnati region. But the sermons are streamed online, which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate.
RIP Medical Debt is able to track the donations back to their original ZIP codes to give back. So, if you donated from Indiana, your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in Indiana.
In Ohio, church officials say, they have abolished $42.8 million in debts across 41,233 households in 103 ZIP codes.
They also abolished $1.9 million in debt across 2,974 Kentucky households, $1.5 million across 503 Tennessee households and $200,000 across 136 Indiana households.
What is RIP Medical Debt? An article posted by USA Today last year explains that RIP Medical Debt is a nonprofit organization based out of Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs.
The article said medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26 percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59 percent reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.
"How sad that probably the only debt that you don't choose to get – cuz you don't choose to get sick – and it's the one that's affecting most people," said Victor Martinez, spiritual growth site leader for the Oakley location.
When a person can't pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people's debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors.
But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.
To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual and $52,000 for a family of four), have debts that are 5% or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.
Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap.
Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.
A debt that never goes away... even if you don't know about it According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt. This rule is called the statute of limitations, and is six years in Ohio.
This means that for any type of debt, a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years, according to America's Debt Help Organization. That timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt. The clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up.
Martinez says that because of this law, many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to Crossroads didn't even know they had medical debt. If it was after those six years, hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling.
"If those six years pass, then nobody can give you a call asking for that money," Martinez said. "But you still owe that money, technically. And the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy, or if you pay for it."
Medical debt never goes away. It will stay on your record if you don't pay it. The law just states that if you don't pay it within that six year window, people will stop asking you to pay – not that you are off the hook.
Martinez said that now that he understands how the law works, he's afraid to call and ask if he owes anything. Because, what if he owes a lot of money? He'll be accountable to pay it, he said.
"That is very scary," he said. "Because what if I have medical debt that I don't know about?"
'A great analogy to what Jesus did for us.' Crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them.
"We kept it off social media," Hill said. "We really want it to be about people in our community, like I said, who are currently giving."
Crossroads members don't know who specifically they have impacted. They could not choose whose debt to pay off. In a letter to each debtor, Crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need, whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community.
"We don't want this to be the last interaction that we have with them, but there are no strings attached," Hill said."We just hope that they understand who Crossroads is, what our heart is for the community, maybe set foot in one of our sites."
This whole experience has been a great analogy to what Jesus did for us, Martinez said.
"Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt," Martinez said. "And here, we don't know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven."
According to RIP Medical Debt, Crossroads' campaign is its largest amount of medical debt that's ever been retired. The nonprofit's site claims that its partnerships have erased almost $1.4 billion in medical debt to date.

The Italian ice shop got its start in the 1930s, when owner Jimmy Callano's great-uncle, Tony Strollo, sold his lemon-flavored ice – along with meatball and sausage sandwiches and hot dogs – from a bus along the Long Branch beachfront.
Fast forward 40 years to when Strollo's son, Ray, opened the first storefront and began making his father's recipe in a soft-serve machine, which makes for a lighter version of Italian ice.
He introduced flavors like orange, cherry and chocolate to the traditional lemon, and today there are six Strollo's Lighthouse locations serving more than two dozen flavors.
What to try: Peanut butter and chocolate Italian ice. Need we say more?
Why it's hot: After a long winter hiatus, the Red Bank and Long Branch stores opened for the season on March 6. The Middletown, Point Pleasant Beach and Oceanport locations will reopen in the coming months.
Go: 250 Ocean Ave. and 69 Brighton Ave. in Long Branch and 64 North Bridge Ave. in Red Bank;
732-229-1222; strolloslighthouse.com.
Velo Eatery, Toms River A gem hidden in plain sight, Jennifer Klotzkin and Matthew Grote's restaurant opened six years ago in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it strip mall on busy Route 9. But their ever-changing menu, shaped by Grote, a graduate of Johnson and Wales University's culinary program, revolves around fresh seafood and comfort dishes and is well worth the U-turn.
What to try: Start with the New England Clam Chowder – Grote worked in Boston area restaurants for more than a decade, including one owned by legendary New England chef Jasper White.
Then onto the specials: Lobster Grilled Cheese with Boardwalk Fries, Crab Cake with Sweet Potato Corn Succotash, or a Lobster Roll with Tarragon Aioli, capped by a slice of Cookies and Cream Cheesecake or Yuzu-Jackfruit Pie.
Why it's hot: Nearly everything is homemade at this dinner-only restaurant, which is open Wednesdays through Saturdays.

Una Pizza Napoletana, Atlantic Highlands You may have heard, but something pretty big happened at the Bayshore last month.
Anthony Mangieri, a Jersey Shore pizza prodigy who began perfecting his pillowy, slightly charred pizzas at Una Pizza Napoletana in Point Pleasant Beach in the late 1990s, later went on to bigger things in the Big Apple.
But as he told The Asbury Park Press last year, "my plan was always to end up back in New Jersey and do what I love in the place that I love."
Una Pizza Napoletana opened Feb. 28.
What to try: Don't ask for slices, as Mangieri only sells whole pies. There's the Marinara, with San Marzano tomatoes, wild oregano, garlic, basil, Sicilian sea salt and olive oil, and the Bianca, made with Buffalo mozzarella. The Apollonia, a specialty pizza served on Saturdays, has salami, egg and mozzarella, and Sundays are for Mangieri's choice.
Why it's hot: It's not every day that a chef who makes what New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells calls "the finest sit-down pizza in the five boroughs" opens at the Shore. Una Pizza Napoletana represents Mangieri's return to his roots, and we're happy he's back.
A tip: Get there early. As the restaurant's website proclaims, Una Pizza Napoletana is open from 5 p.m. until Mangieri runs out of dough.

Texto completo: "Listen to our public health experts and our professional leaders, both at the state and federal government."
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley encouraged Iowans on Wednesday to "forget about listening to political leaders" when it comes to the coronavirus.
"There's some conflicting information coming out, so I'd encourage folks to forget about listening to political leaders on the subject," Grassley told reporters in his opening statement Wednesday morning, referring to coronavirus. "Listen to our public health experts and our professional leaders, both at the state and federal government."
He said he wasn't alluding to any specific misinformation, but merely that "political leaders aren't experts on health care issues."
"I don't know what mistakes have been made, if any have been made," Grassley said when asked to elaborate on the statement. "But when you listen to people like Dr. Fauci, it gives a great deal of credibility to the information that the public wants and needs."
As Grassley held his weekly news conference, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned a U.S. House of Representatives committee that, "bottom line, it's going to get worse."
"I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now," Fauci said, according to NPR. "How much worse we'll get will depend on our ability to do two things: to contain the influx of people who are infected coming from the outside, and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country."
At about the same time Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic, meaning it has turned into a global health concern. More than 4,300 deaths are confirmed to be related to the coronavirus and the number of confirmed cases has passed 121,000.
In the United States, 31 people have died due to the coronavirus and there are more than 1,000 confirmed cases. Thirteen Iowans had tested presumptively positive for the coronavirus as of Tuesday evening, and one was taken to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in "critical condition" on Wednesday.
Two weeks before the pandemic declaration, President Donald Trump said that, while "every aspect of our society should be prepared," he didn't think those plans would bear out.
"I don't think it's going to come to that, especially with the fact that we're going down, not up," Trump said at a Feb. 26 White House briefing. "We're going very substantially down, not up."
On March 6, Trump told reporters at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta that "anybody who wants a (coronavirus) test gets a test."
Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump tabbed to head the country's coronavirus response, warned that "We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward," according to the New York Times. Pence added that people who have been exposed and showing symptoms of coronavirus infection — which can take days to show after exposure — were able to receive tests.
Grassley, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he is also keeping an eye on the economic ripples of the virus and the possible need to goose the economy as a result. He said Monday he would look at the possibility of targeted tax cuts but emphasized on the press call that "everything is on the table" for how to respond to a slowing economy.
"We continue to assess the economic impact of it, and it doesn't look like it's anything to worry now, but maybe two weeks from now, we'll have indication that dramatic action has to happen," Grassley said.
Shortly after the news conference, Senate Democrats released their economic package related to coronavirus, including mandating businesses provide paid sick leave, emergency unemployment insurance, rental and mortgage payment assistance and using disaster relief grants to help small businesses.
In the meantime, Grassley doesn't plan to change scheduled community meetings next week, though he encouraged precautions like standing three to six feet away from people, not shaking hands and washing and disinfecting hands regularly.
"If there's dangers, or if there's any changes, I'll let Iowans know," Grassley said. "And as leaders, I think we, in the Congress, have to continue to do the people's business, all while following medical experts to take the precautions that are necessary, and that's what I'm going to do."
He added, "You have to remember what our public health experts are saying: That at this point in the United States — and this may be different tomorrow or a week from now — but, right now, they're all saying the risk remains very low."

Texto completo: Last month, our Hot List — a monthly roundup featuring of-the-moment restaurants — included Brunch, a new breakfast, brunch and lunch spot in Red Bank; the reinvented Point Lobster Bar & Grill, born from the union of Europa South and Point Lobster Company; and the incredibly popular The Butcher's Block in Long Branch, where you can't get a table on a Saturday night until late May.

Pensacola native, New York Times journalist tackles Michael Bloomberg

Texto completo: Pensacola native and veteran journalist Eleanor Randolph has attempted to portray one of America's foremost billionaires."The Many Lives of Michael Bloomberg," her comprehensive biography of the former mayor of New York City, is a literary coda after retiring from the New York Times.
"Basically, he thought he admired it because he thought it was fair," Randolph said about Bloomberg's reaction."At one point he told me, 'Not bad for somebody who works for the NYTimes.'"
Published by Simon and Schuster and released last September, Randolph's assessment could be read as a textbook for the city's post 9/11 recovery led by an ambitious entrepreneur or as a cautionary tale about mayoral overreach.The biography's status was raised last fall when Bloomberg announced his bid to run for president in the Democratic Party Primary, much to the chagrin of his opponents.The move contradicted the closing of Randolph's book, which had all but shut down the possibility of his deciding to run. During her talk and book signing last November at the Pensacola Museum of Art, Randolph seemed a little put off by Bloomberg's sudden pivot.
"I thought he was happy until last Thursday," Randolph said dryly days after Bloomberg's announcement.
Her PMA talk was a sort of homecoming event within the 12-day Foo Foo Festival.
"Such an accomplished professional career and it all began here in Pensacola," said Maria Goldberg, festival chair. "She was more than delighted to come back to Pensacola, give a talk about the book and host a Q&A session."
Randolph's life-long friend, Suzie Riley, recalls that she was a precocious wordsmith.
"The joke in the neighborhood was that if you couldn't find her, she was at her old typewriter," said Riley, a retired sculptor, who's active in the local arts community.
Riley lived across the street from Randolph in Warrington when they both attended Pensacola High school. Riley wrote for Tiger's Tale, the school newspaper while Randolph worked on the yearbook.
Born in Pensacola in 1943, Randolph grew up initially in North Hill, catching the attention of the librarian at P.K. Yonge Elementary School.
"I read most of the biographies and whatever else she suggested," Randolph said. "I remember she showed my parents my library card, actually several library cards stapled together. I was so proud."
In the mid '50's Randolph's family moved to Warrington, the golden years of conformity.
"We all wore the same thing or tried to," she said."I was tall, skinny, awkward, and bookish, never a good way to survive high school."
Throughout adolescence she found solace and admiration from her teachers whom she credits for sowing her career.
"We had a great civics teacher at PHS who made us read U.S. News and World Report, and Miss Monroe, the Latin teacher, was terrifyingly wonderful," Randolph recalled.
After graduating in 1960, Randolph went to Queens College (now Queens University of Charlotte) for two years, which she remembers as an "excellent education, especially in English and English Literature."
"For someone who wanted to be a writer, it was quiet and supportive, just what was needed."
She became the school's representative for the National Student Association amid the protests of the early '60s and went to its annual convention, spending most of her time listening. The dean at Queens College told her she might be happier at a larger university after she was caught hitchhiking. On top of that, she said her politics didn't gel with the idea of a "Queens lady." Randolph transferred to Emory University to study history and got her bearings at its humor magazine.
"They called me the 'editor of editors' which meant I tried my best to keep them out of trouble," she said."They thought it was a joke. I took it seriously."
After college she floated around a bit until the Pensacola News Journal came calling.Her former summer work prompted Pat Lloyd, the paper's social writer, to recruit her.
"I yearned to be on the city desk of course and eventually she helped me get there," Randolph said. "My first real story was about a fire near Warrington, and I went back to what was then the press area to watch it being printed. That was it. I knew I would be a newspaper reporter as long as the world would let me do it."
Her beat was education, which included a column where she was a proponent of school desegregation.
"My views were considered way out there and after a few months, the editors seemed to move the column to the least-read corners of the paper," Randolph said. "I remembered writing about a school for black students that was altogether too near a smokestack, forcing teachers to shut windows even in the hotter days."
As a result, then-editor J. Earle Bowden "suggested she might be happier elsewhere." Randolph was immediately picked up by the St. Petersburg Times, a proving ground for young journalists especially during the political tumult of the early '70's. In 1974 she started reporting for the Chicago Sun-Times, covering one of the most active precincts of urban corruption during the tenure of Mayor Richard Daley.
"Chicago politics was raw and fascinating," she reminisced. "I had seen some of the political tricks in the South, but Daley's people made that look like child's play."
She switched to the rival paper, Chicago Tribune, joining the likes of Charlie Rose, Andrea Mitchell, and Sam Donaldson, to cover the Carter campaign in Plains, Georgia.Here, she met her future husband, Peter Pringle, a British writer and journalist on July 4, 1976.
"I often say that on a day that America celebrated its liberation from the British, I became attached to one for life."
Randolph joined the Washington Post in 1984. In 1991, Pringle was transferred to Moscow where Randolph was the Post's Russian correspondent. The U.S.S.R. dissolved later that year and the West was anxiously watching its transition into capitalism. With her proximity, Randolph wrote "Waking the Tempests: Ordinary Life in the New Russia," a well-received book tracing the struggles of ordinary citizens during the transfer.
"The Russian people are amazing," she declared. "I wanted to write about their lives in this mid-way point between one system and whatever the next would be."
From 1993-1995 she was the Post's New York correspondent, covering the trial of the terrorist group responsible for the attack on the World Trade Center. She joined the New York Times in 1998, submitting serial coverage of state corruption in Albany that garnered two nominations for the Pulitzer Prize. After the 2001 terrorist attacks Michael Bloomberg, a politically-ambidextrous candidate, was elected mayor. With her background of covering a budding presidential candidate and the complexity of mayoral politics, Randolph's focus on the new mayor's attempt to rebuild a defeated city was fitting. She endorsed Bloomberg's opponent during his first run but supported him for his other two. From her cumulative expertise of his business and time in office the time was right for a book.
"We are not friends, but we talk, and he knows that I have grown to admire him," said Randolph. "But I'm still a journalist and he recognizes that."

Texto completo: There's an old song by The O'Jays that seems especially apropos to this moment.
The refrain goes: "Those lies done caught up with you this time."
The song was about a faithless lover getting her comeuppance.
But it also works as a verdict on so-called conservatives in an age of looming pandemic.
At this writing, there have been, according to a New York Times database, more than 1,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 - caused by the novel coronavirus - in the United States; 31 of the afflicted have died.
Meantime, the stock market has dropped like a boulder from a cliff, colleges are canceling classes, sports leagues are preparing to play in empty arenas.
Internationally, more than 121,000 people have been stricken.
All of Italy is on lockdown, Spain has shuttered every nursery school, high school and university in and around Madrid and a St. Patrick's Day parade has been called off - in Dublin.
Those are the grim facts.
But the view from inside the facts-resistant bubble that passes for conservatism these days is quite different.
If you live in there, you've heard Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh assure you that the virus that has galvanized doctors around the world is really just "the common cold" weaponized to hurt Donald Trump.
You've seen Rep. Matt Gaetz mock concerns over the coronavirus by wearing a gas mask in the Capitol; he has since had to self-quarantine after a possible exposure.
Meantime, King Liar himself, Trump, keeps doing what comes naturally.
He said a vaccine will be ready in just a few months. It won't.
He said the number of Americans afflicted is going down. It isn't.
He said anyone who needs a test can get one. They can't.
He said that the World Health Organization gave "a false number" in predicting a global mortality rate of 3.4 percent.
And on what basis did he question a respected international organization of medical professionals?
Trump said he had a "hunch."
Then there's this recent tweet from writer Jelani Cobb of The New Yorker: "Overheard from the person in front of me on line at CPAC last week: 'I don't believe anything the CDC says about this virus. It's full of deep staters who want to use this to create a recession to bring down the president.' "
As it happens, it was at CPAC - the annual Conservative Political Action Conference - that Gaetz was apparently exposed.
You can't make this stuff up.
But that doesn't stop right-wingers from trying.
It was in 2005 that Stephen Colbert coined the word "truthiness" to describe the then-new phenomenon of Americans prioritizing information they "felt" to be true over that which objectively was.
Though restricted to no ideology, truthiness was much more common and - through a nexus of cable news, the internet and various integrity-free politicians - much more encouraged on the political right.
In 2005, the danger of this may have felt somewhat abstract - a decline in the quality of political discourse.
But by 2016, when a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside a Washington pizzeria because he believed a debunked anti-Hillary Clinton conspiracy theory, it was already glaringly clear that "alternative facts" could have dangerous, real-world implications.
Now there is this. One wonders if it will be the breaking point; if, faced with direct risk to their own lives, conservatives will finally quit suckling at the teat of mass delusion.
Let's hope so, for all our sake.
A virus, after all, respects no ideological borders, so the right wing's refusal to respect reality puts everyone at risk.
With apologies to The O'Jays, those lies done caught up with us all.

Bloomberg's job security promises falling through

Texto completo: When multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hired an army of staff members for his presidential campaign, he lavished them with salaries that were nearly double what other candidates were paying. His campaign also promised something rivals could not match: job security through the general election, even if he dropped out of the race.
But now, less than a week after Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, left the Democratic presidential race - endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden and pledging to put his vast resources behind him - hundreds of Bloomberg's field organizers and regional organizing directors around the country are suddenly without jobs, having received emails Monday that encouraged them to keep their campaign-issued electronics as a sort of severance payment.
In a series of conference calls Monday, campaign staff members outside battleground states learned that their work had ended and that they would be paid through the end of March, according to seven people who were on such calls. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements they had signed with the campaign, from which they were seeking to be released.
"We sincerely appreciate your commitment and dedication over the past few months!" read an email that the workers received, which was reviewed by The New York Times. "As a token of our appreciation, we are offering you the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone."
The email specified the value of those devices - ranging from $1,400 to $1,700, depending on the model of the computer - and noted that employees would be required to pay taxes on those amounts.
The former campaign workers - at-will employees who said they had been promised employment through November in job interviews - were asked in a survey to indicate if they wanted to be referred to another presidential campaign, and if they were open to moving to one of six states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
A spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign said in a statement Monday that the campaign had been clear about its intention to focus on those states as the field of primary candidates narrowed.
"As we've said over the course of the campaign, this election will come down to six battleground states," the statement said. "It's imperative that we invest there with staff and infrastructure. Staff who were working in non-battleground states and would like to learn about future opportunities in the battleground states are being asked to let us know so we can consider them for jobs there."
The former staff members, some of whom said they were consulting employment lawyers, said they had asked to be released from the nondisclosure agreements, calling it unfair to be unable to talk about their work for the campaign as they found themselves unemployed and searching for new jobs. Some people had moved to new states for the campaign, receiving stipends to relocate for what they had expected would be nearly a year.
On Monday, some of the affected staff members turned their organizing efforts inward, seeking to reach senior campaign aides who might have been involved in the decision.
In ramping up operations quickly after Bloomberg declared his candidacy last November, the campaign used pay as a powerful recruitment tool, assembling a legion of workers across the country and offering unusually high salaries. Field organizers were offered $6,000 a month, nearly twice the $3,500 that other campaigns paid.
Over the course of his 14-week campaign, Bloomberg emphasized his commitment to unseating President Donald Trump and promised to support whoever won the Democratic nomination. Last week, days before he exited the race, he specified that he planned to keep his "main field offices" open.

DON'T SKIP THE SALT For a better cocktail, reach for a different shaker

Texto completo: Often, the goal when making drinks at home is to, well, drink at home. It's not to try a new technique, buy an obscure bottle you'll use only a quarter ounce of, or wait 20-plus minutes for a cocktail - that's what bars are for.
There is, however, one major lesson to be learned from the bar: You should be salting your cocktails.
Bartenders often add dashes of salt to cocktails for the same reason a pastry chef would never skip it in a chocolate cake batter. It just bolsters flavor.
The add is not meant to be enough to actually make a drink taste salty. Rather, "salt is a key ingredient when you're trying to create something with depth," said Dorothy Elizabeth, a bar manager at Mr Lyan, a bar group with locations in London, Amsterdam and Washington. "Sodium ions block bitter flavors, emphasize sweetness, and create really nice depth and dimension."
Most drinks benefit from a hit of salinity, but if you're new to seasoning your cocktails, start by adding a pinch to a drink that leans bitter, such as a Negroni.
"It mellows out the taste of the Campari," Elizabeth said. "You're able to round out and create richer, fuller flavors without necessarily modifying anything - just through the addition of salt."
Another drink that greatly benefits from a grain or two is one that contains fresh citrus, like the margarita. Just as salt dampens the bitterness in a Negroni, it intensifies the palate's ability to sense sweet and sour notes. Add it to heighten the flavors in your next sidecar, caipirinha or gimlet.
As for salt type, raid your kitchen. Kosher salt, fleur de sel and flaky sea salts like Maldon or Jacobsen all work well to balance and brighten without overwhelming. Since the meaning of a pinch differs from one person - and salt - to the next, most bartenders use a low-concentration saline solution to ensure consistency. But Elizabeth leaves the dropper at work.
"If I'm making drinks at home, you better believe I'm just pinching it and putting it directly in my drink," she said.
For Elizabeth, a pinch means a few small flakes of sea salt, no more. Keep your additions to a minimum and remember that - just as when seasoning a savory dish or offering to drive someone to the airport - once it's out there, you can't take it back. A small pinch is enough to shift and enhance the flavor profiles of your cocktail. Begin with restraint, and add a few flakes later if needed.
Next time you're mixing a favorite cocktail, grab your salt dish or shaker from the kitchen and experiment with it. Divide the drink between two glasses, and add a tiny pinch of salt to one of them. Soon enough, that other shaker may find a permanent home on your bar.

Texto completo: Howard Wolinsky is a medical journalist in Flossmoor, Illinois, who knows better than to go forward with potentially life-changing surgery without first seeking a second opinion.
Nine years ago, at age 63, when a PSA blood test followed by a biopsy revealed cancer in Wolinsky's prostate gland, the diagnosing urologist said he could operate to remove the offending organ the following week.
Not so fast, Wolinsky thought, knowing this was not a minor operation and one that often left men temporarily or permanently impotent, incontinent or both. So before having surgery Wolinsky consulted Dr. Scott Eggener, a University of Chicago urologist, who reviewed the test results and proposed an alternative strategy called "active surveillance."
Not to be confused with "watchful waiting," active surveillance is not a do-nothing approach. Rather, patients are routinely monitored and referred for surgery or radiation therapy only if their cancer begins to grow or show molecular signs of aggression.
Current estimates are that about half of men found to have prostate cancer could avoid radical treatment and its potential side effects if they were willing to live with having a cancer, albeit a seemingly benign one, in their bodies.
These are men whose cancer is deemed, based on its biological characteristics, to be low risk in terms of progressing to a potentially life-threatening state.
Only if periodic exams reveal that a man's cancer is shown to be progressing to a more aggressive state would more radical treatment be considered. For men who choose active surveillance, Eggener said, this generally affects about 5% annually for the first five to 10 years.
Other reasons for abandoning active surveillance and undergoing radical treatment include the patients' growing anxiety about living with cancer and pressure from family members, and sometimes even from their doctors to "get it out," clinicians report.
Watchful waiting, which involves little or no monitoring, is still sometimes suggested but mainly reserved for men with a limited life expectancy for other reasons or those whose health status makes surgery inadvisable.
Based on his PSA of less than 4 and a Gleason score of 6, Wolinsky said, "Dr. Eggener told me, 'You're the perfect candidate - the poster child for active surveillance.' "
The Gleason score is a measure of the cancer's aggressiveness, and a composite score of less than 7 is generally deemed low-risk disease.
So starting in 2010, Wolinsky had a PSA test and digital rectal exam every six months and an annual biopsy of the prostate, which was eventually lengthened to every three years. It's now been four years since the last biopsy, and chances are, unless a worrisome rise in the PSA occurs and other tests indicate an aggressive cancer, he may never need another.
Given the now rapidly changing methods of monitoring and diagnosing the lethality of prostate cancer, it behooves every man told he has cancer in this gland to explore the most currently available management options before deciding on treatment. There are now even support groups to help reassure men with a low-risk cancer who choose active surveillance.
"The field is on fire," said Dr. Laurence Klotz, a leading expert on urological cancer and pioneer of active surveillance.
"Within a few years, we'll have urine and blood tests that are so reliable we'll know which men don't even need a biopsy. Instead of a biopsy, there are now at least five biomarkers and more being developed that can be used as an initial test."
Even the process of biopsy has changed.
For decades, when a possible cancer was suspected based on the PSA test or digital rectal exam, doctors blindly took 12 core samples from the prostate to search for a malignancy. Now an MRI can be done first and a biopsy performed only if and when a potentially serious lesion is revealed. High-resolution ultrasound may even become a simpler and less expensive alternative to an MRI, Klotz said.
To avoid the need for a biopsy, Klotz is leading a large Canadian clinical trial, called Precise, to determine if an MRI is sufficiently accurate in detecting dangerous cancers and distinguishing them from harmless ones. He estimates, based on early data, that as many as 250,000 men a year in Canada and the United States could avoid unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to identify clinically significant cancers.
This approach results in the diagnosis of many fewer indolent cancers that would most likely never threaten a man's life, said Klotz, a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto.
"With an MRI, we find fewer of these low-grade cancers, and fewer men will be overtreated," he said.
If Eggener had his way, he would not even call it cancer for men with a Gleason score of 6 or lower because "it fails to meet the clinical definition of cancer: the ability to cause symptoms, metastasize or lead to death," he wrote in an email. "Removing the cancer label has been done in other cancers, most notably a subtype of thyroid and bladder cancers. I predict this will eventually happen for Gleason 6 prostate cancer and be reason for celebration."

Texto completo: Antonia "Tony" Ackerman could be summed up by her daughters as a softhearted, self-taught wordsmith with a "wicked" sense of humor and a particular fixation on The New York Times crossword puzzle. Ellen and Laura Ackerman say the longtime Syosset resident was also a fashionista with an affinity for bold colors and statement jewelry.
"She was always beautifully dressed and coordinated," Laura said.
Old photos of Ackerman capture her in bright red lipstick, side-swept curls, and stylish jewelry including spiral flower earrings and a necklace with a snake on it. As she aged, her doctors told her no more high heels - only sneakers.
"But she had all different colors of sneakers and always coordinated with her outfit," Laura added with a laugh.
Ackerman's later days of color-coordinated outfits and elegant ensembles were a far cry from her childhood - growing up in St. Peter Freienstein, Austria, under Nazi occupation, she struggled to get by with little food and unsuitable clothing. Then she met the love of her life, Marvin, in Salzburg. Ackerman married him, converted to Judaism and together they moved to New York in 1956, eventually ending up in Syosset.
"She spoke English but she wanted to speak better and she used the newspaper as a way to increase her knowledge of not only current events, but also vocabulary," Ellen said.
Ackerman died on Feb. 7 at the age of 90, her family said, having spent her last four decades on Long Island.
Ackerman's daughters said that, during their childhood, she rarely divulged memories of living in Austria but opened up more as she got older. These wartime tales of a young woman who fed dogs that followed her home and stood up to a soldier who tried to take her bicycle opened up a whole new side of their mother that the girls hadn't known.
The stories were revelatory at times. Five years ago, Laura said she took a trip to Austria with her parents and her husband, and they were riding along in a car miles from Ackerman's hometown.
"She stopped and said, 'This must be around where my girlfriends and I came to look for food,'" Laura said. "We were two hours from her old house, and there were no cars then. She said during the war, they were short on food so [Ackerman's family] sent her and her friend out to find a farmer and trade for some food." 
Laura remembers her saying, "I don't remember what we did; I guess we slept outside overnight." She estimates her mother must have been around 14 at that time. 
"To grow up like that is so far away from how we grew up," Laura said.
Every Sunday, Ackerman filled out the crossword puzzle in the Times. She also watched "Jeopardy!" religiously, and kept score for herself as she followed along with the players.
After Ellen grew up and moved out, she knew not to call her mother on weeknights between 7 and 7:30 p.m.
Ackerman worked as an operations manager for a company that sold medical supplies to hospitals, retiring in 1993. She was friendly with her colleagues, and Laura added that her mother would strike up conversations with just about anyone, from servers in restaurants to workers who sold her lottery tickets.
"When people had accents, she asked where they were from," she said. "She wasn't discriminatory; she was genuinely interested. She would ask them how to say 'hello' in their language."
Ackerman always tried to learn "a few words" from the languages of countries she visited, Laura said. She was an avid traveler, setting foot in Thailand, China and various parts of Europe. Ellen noted that her mother had something positive to say about every single place she visited.
Wherever Ackerman went, her daughters agreed that she always traveled in style - a big change from her days in Austria. Laura remembers her mother saying she had a pair of "wooden shoes" that weren't even clogs; just shoes made out of wooden slats.
"She always looked at people and would never judge them based on where they come from or what they do," Laura said.
Ackerman is survived by her daughters, Ellen Ackerman (married to Charles Jablonski) of Manhattan and Laura Ackerman (married to Hal Berenson) of Colorado. Her husband preceded her in death. Ackerman was cremated and her daughters will be spreading her ashes in Aust

THE DIET THAT'S BUTTER FOR YOU CHEF ROCCO DISPIRITO FINDS COMFORT IN GOING KETO

Texto completo: The keto diet was everything Rocco DiSpirito ever dreamed of.
The notion that fat is fuel was music to his ears. He could lose some serious weight and fast while continuing to eat cheese, heavy cream, steaks, bacon and his "favorite food in the world" - butter.
As a restaurant chef, he cooked with real fats all the time and so was tasting them constantly. Plus, the diet worked; he was losing "shedloads" of pounds.
However, along with the weight loss came boredom. The limited diet excludes most fruits, starchy vegetables, bread, pasta and grains. This meant he could not have the crusty Italian bread, lasagna or breaded chicken Parmesan that he grew up on. Taste fatigue was setting in and so was panic.
"I started pondering this whole keto-is-boring thing and thinking about how I could turn keto meals into comfort food at its tastiest, especially at a time when my own fat-burning flames needed some fanning," he writes in his latest cookbook, "Rocco's Keto Comfort Food Diet," which went on sale last week.
He was convinced that the diet needed a makeover. While staying true to its motto of low carbs and high fat, it needed to include a wider range of foods and ones that people enjoy eating.
"I wanted to advance conversations about keto by combining it with comfort foods because they usually conform to a lot of starches," Mr. DiSpirito said in a recent phone interview.
"Rocco's Keto Comfort Food Diet" is the Culinary Institute of America grad's 14th cookbook. His first, "Flavor," won a James Beard Award; the last nine books have been about health and wellness.
Long before becoming a keto diet advocate, Mr. DiSpirito was a rock star in the culinary world. In the late 1990s, he ran the kitchen in New York City's Union Pacific, earning a three-star review from The New York Times. His eponymous restaurant on 22nd Street was the subject of an NBC reality series, "The Restaurant."
In 2004, he fell on hard times and announced he was taking a break from his restaurant's day-to-day operations. He turned to pitch for pasta, pots and luxury cars, popping up on reality TV shows as a judge and fox-trotting as a contestant on "Dancing With the Stars."
Then out of the blue, he returned to the restaurant world in 2018 when he joined The Standard Grill in New York City as executive chef, only to leave the business again last October.
These days he is a chef without a restaurant. His company, Pound a Day, promotes his Pound a Day diet, which is designed to help people lose up to 5 pounds every five days. He advises clients in New York City, Los Angeles and Florida on how they can enjoy their favorite foods through healthy dieting.
Mr. DiSpirito was scheduled to have been among the panelists to talk about health, wellness and the keto lifestyle at the 42nd annual International Association of Culinary Professionals conference in Pittsburgh later this month. The conference has since been postponed to October because of concerns over COVID-19.
Here are some highlights from the phone interview:
Why keto works: "It's the easiest diet to understand and is about low carbs and high fats. You have to avoid empty calorie carbs and there are not many obstacles to meet. It is a diet without deprivation and it keeps up its promise: If you follow the diet faithfully, you will lose weight rapidly."
How it works: "Sugar, not fat, is the villain. When you limit carbs in your diet, the body shifts from the carb tank to the fat tank and burns the fat faster. So dieters can lose a pound a day, feel energized but not deprived."
On comfort and cravings: Eating comfort foods the keto way played a big role in not only satisfying his cravings but also not leaving him hangry. As a result he was able to fit keto into his lifestyle almost effortlessly.
In his recipes, all-purpose flour is replaced by almond and coconut flours for biscuits, muffins, doughnuts, cinnamon rolls and dumpling soup. Pancakes and desserts are sweetened with erythritol, and leafy greens stand in for bread in tacos and burgers.
Meatballs are served with zucchini noodles, and cauliflower comes to the rescue in a low-carb pizza, mashed potatoes, hash browns and mac 'n' cheese.
Common sense advice: "It is a false narrative that a diet works only when you are dieting. If you comply with the metrics of a diet and transform into a conscious eater, it will work. Then all you need to do is to continue the good behavior for life.
"Through counseling, I convert my clients to make informed decisions. As a result some of them have lost 7 to 8 pounds in three days."
On bending the rules: He said some keto rules are over the top, and so dieters can loosen up some as time goes on. But he insisted they need to stay on a strict plan in the beginning, especially if they have bad food habits.
Although the diet advocates eating lots of red meat, "one should not be eating it three times a day, seven days a week," he says. Also, it is not advisable to be on it forever. "People do need to add exercising and leafy foods to the mix. You need to look at it holistically."
* Next on the keto agenda: "It's about pushing the conversation toward plant-based, Mediterranean and clean and whole foods."
* On other diets: The first diet he ever tried was Atkins. He went on the diet because he was training for a triathlon and wanted to get into shape quickly. "I lost 10 pounds but found it restrictive and so moved to keto."
He has avoided the Sirtfood diet, which includes special foods like dark chocolate and red wine. Dieters can consume a total of only 1,000 calories for the first three days. "Sirtfood is disingenuous, and I am not in favor of its severe calorie restrictions. Its whole hook is the red wine and chocolate."
* Memories of Pittsburgh: When Mr. DiSpirito was a Culinary Institute student, his roommate was a native Pittsburgher. When they visited, he remembers being struck by how helpful people were.
"When I woke up in the morning, my roommate's father was washing and waxing my car. That was really bizarrely nice of him. It wasn't just him. I found other people to be charming, too. I hope you have held on to your kindness and generosity. People say it is one of the most livable cities in the country. I'm from New York City, and I don't easily accept that. But I understand why people say it. Pittsburgh has a pace that is just right."

CHICKEN AND DUMPLING SOUP
PG TESTED
The almond flour-based dumplings in this soup should not be cooked on a high setting or allowed to simmer for too long because they will fall apart.
For soup
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
½ pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
Celtic sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
½ yellow onion, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1 small carrot, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons fresh thyme
4 cups chicken stock
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
? cup heavy cream
For dumplings
1 cup shredded low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons full-fat cream cheese
¾ cup almond flour
½ teaspoon baking powder
Celtic sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 large egg, beaten
Make chicken soup: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over high heat until shimmering. Season chicken with salt and pepper, add to pot and cook until golden brown on all sides and almost cooked through, about 8 minutes total. Remove chicken to a plate.
Add onion, celery and carrot to pot and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add garlic during the last minute of cooking. Add thyme and season with salt and pepper.
Return chicken to pot, add chicken stock, bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
Cook for 25 minutes to meld the flavors and season again with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in parsley and cream and reduce to the lowest simmer setting.
Make the dumplings: Place mozzarella and cream cheese in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until melted and smooth.
Add almond flour and baking powder and season with salt and pepper.
Once cooled slightly, add beaten egg and stir until dough forms.
Transfer dough to a piece of parchment paper and roll into 12 small balls.
Drop dumplings into simmering soup and cook until lightly puffed, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Do not simmer on a high setting or for too long.
Makes 6 servings.

MAMA'S KETO MEATBALLS WITH ZUCCHINI NOODLES
PG TESTD
Rocco DiSpirito's mother's meatballs were legendary at the now defunct red sauce restaurant, Rocco's on 22nd Street, in New York City. He gives the meatballs a keto twist by using cheese crisps instead of breadcrumbs and serving them with zoodles.
It is important not to overcook the meatballs, he said, and add more stock to make them juicy. Also, instead of whole eggs, add the protein psyllium husk to the egg white for a good mouthfeel.
For marinara sauce
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, crushed through a press
2 tablespoons finely chopped yellow onion
¾ teaspoon tomato paste
Red pepper flakes
Celtic sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 (16-ounce) can tomato puree
½ (16-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
¼ cup chicken stock
1½ cups water
? teaspoon liquid stevia (optional)
For meatballs
Olive oil or avocado oil cooking spray
? cup chicken stock
¼ yellow onion, roughly chopped
1 clove garlic, peeled but whole
½ pound ground beef
½ pound ground pork
½ pound ground veal
? cup store-bought Parmesan crisps (such as Whisps)
2 large eggs
¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
¼ cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 teaspoon Celtic sea salt
For zucchini noodles
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound store-bought zucchini noodles
Celtic sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving
* For marinara sauce: In a saucepot, heat olive oil over medium-low heat. Add garlic and onion, and cook until garlic is tender and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds.
Season with red pepper flakes, salt and black pepper to taste.
Add tomato puree, crushed tomatoes, chicken stock and water to the pot along with liquid stevia (if using) and stir to combine.
Bring to a simmer, season with salt to taste, cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes.
If the sauce is too thick, add a little water. The sauce should be fairly thin and very smooth, but not watery.
* For meatballs: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat sheet pan with cooking spray.
In a food processor or blender, combine chicken stock, onion and garlic and puree.
Transfer mixture to a large bowl and add meats, crisps, eggs, Parmigiano, pepper flakes, parsley and salt. Mix with your hands until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
Grease hands with olive oil and form mixture into 12 balls a little smaller than golf balls.
Arrange meatballs on the sheet pan and bake until browned, 18-20 minutes.
Transfer finished meatballs to marinara sauce and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes.
* Prepare zucchini noodles: In a large saute pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
Add zucchini noodles and cook until tender but still a little crunchy, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
Serve meatballs and sauce over zucchini noodles sprinkled with Parmigiano.
Makes 6 servings.

TIME COMES TO BAN CROWDS NCAA, SOME NHL SITES IN STEP; PENGUINS SHOULD FOLLOW SUIT

Texto completo: As the afternoon wore on, delivering one haymaker headline after another, it soon became clear: March 11, 2020, would go down as one of the most significant and stunning days in the history of American sports.
First, the World Health Organization, which had been reluctant to do so, officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic, with over 100 countries reporting cases.
Next, NCAA president Mark Emmert released a statement saying the men's and women's Division I basketball tournaments would be played in near-empty arenas, with only "essential" personnel and some family on-hand.
I never thought I'd say this, but Emmert was a leading voice of reason here. It was nothing short of stunning to see the NCAA putting human welfare over gross revenue, and it might yet cancel the tournaments altogether.
Which brings us to something else I didn't think I'd say: The NCAA story was just a prelude to the biggest news of the day. At approximately 9:30 p.m., the NBA announced it would suspend its season in the wake of Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert testing positive for COVID-19.
That, quite obviously, changes everything.
Meanwhile, around the time of the NCAA bombshell, Ohio governor Mike DeWine turned a recommendation into an order: Mass gatherings would be prohibited in his state. That meant no fans for Thursday's game between the Penguins and Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena.
Now, it's the NHL's move. The league released a statement shortly after 10 p.m. that read as such: "The National Hockey League is aware of the NBA's decision tonight to indefinitely suspend its season due to a player testing positive for the coronavirus. The NHL is continuing to consult with medical experts and is evaluating the options. We expect to have a further update tomorrow."
For many, all of this is a wild overreaction, a concession to fear and paranoia.
It won't last.
It's no worse than the average flu.
Let's hope so, right? I'd love to believe it, except I see the numbers coming out of other countries - Italy, for example - and they are at the very least highly concerning.
Two weeks ago, Italy had 322 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One week ago, 2,502. By Wednesday, 10,149, and the country was in total lockdown. Even the restaurants were closed.
In the United States, as of early Wednesday evening, the number of positive COVID-19 cases had increased to 1,190, in 41 states and Washington, D.C., according to the New York Times. Now go back and track Italy's upsurge.
Chico Harlan, a former Pittsburgh Post-Gazette sports writer, is the Rome bureau chief for the Washington Post. He tweeted Wednesday that "in a matter of three days, the coronavirus death toll in Italy has gone from 366 to 827."
Seems to me those are just pertinent facts, not alarmist "fake news" warnings.
Harlan also tweeted: "This is the problem many countries will face with coronavirus: the disease spreads under the radar, and the restrictive measures seem worthwhile to a society only after the explosion has been set in motion."
So what's wrong with trying to be aggressively proactive here? What is wrong with erring on the side of extreme caution? That it might interfere with our precious games? That it might interfere with teams' precious profits?
Pardon the intrusion to your sports-addled haze - I know this is terribly inconvenient and might even affect your Fantasy lineup - but there's a pandemic happening, and all we really know is that it's growing and there is no current vaccine.
That doesn't mean we're all doomed. But I'm gonna go ahead and believe the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and what he told a congressional committee Wednesday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci said he would advise the NBA, as an example, to ban fans from games in response to COVID-19.
"We would recommend that there not be large crowds," Fauci said. "As a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread."
Importantly, Fauci also said COVID-19's death rate is 1 percent, or 10 times "more lethal" than seasonal flu, and his estimate was lower than the WHO's estimate of of 3.4%.
"I can say we will see more cases," Fucci said, "and things will get worse than they are right now."
Again, none of that strikes me as hysterical. It strikes me as sensible, and every professional sports team currently in session, including the Penguins, should get on board - not that banning fans will suddenly resolve a burgeoning health crisis.
As of early Wednesday evening, the Penguins intended to allow fans into games. Their statement: "The Penguins have been in regular contact with the NHL, the city, county, and health authorities and have determined that, based upon the facts before us, home games, including Sunday's game against NYI, will go on as scheduled in front of fans."
Extra precautions will be taken, such as regular cleanings of the escalator handrails, and I suppose that is laudable.
But I'm also guessing that by Sunday, the Penguins won't have a choice. If the NHL lets the games go on - and hopes no player tests positive - it has to empty the arenas.
It has to.

HIGHER ED'S MANDATORY POLITICAL PARTICIPATION ENFORCED CONFORMITY WILL DAMAGE OUR UNIVERSITIES

Texto completo: The Free Speech Movement, an early tremor of the earthquake that shook campuses in the 1960s, began on Sproul Plaza at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964. Today, eight of the 10 universities in the UC system are administering faculty hiring practices that involve coerced speech, enforced political conformity and mandatory political participation.
Any academic seeking a position is required to write a "diversity, equity and inclusion" (DEI) statement affirming support - sometimes even "enthusiastic" support - for, and demonstrating activism in support of, a system-wide orthodoxy. In the required statement ("Demonstrating Interest in and Ability to Advance Diversity, Equity and Inclusion"), an applicant should show that he or she has been active, and must promise to be active, in advancing the approved agenda. This process explicitly subordinates assessments of academic excellence.
Abigail Thompson, chair of the mathematics department at UC-Davis, praises diversity (without explaining how ethnic, racial and gender diversity improves teaching and research in mathematics). But she thinks mandatory DEI statements have a problematic pedigree.
In 1949, during the Cold War anxiety about communist subversion, Robert Sproul, president of the UC system, proposed that university employees sign an oath attesting that they were not members of the Communist Party or other organizations advocating violent revolution. Protests, litigation and the firing of some nonsigners ensued. Then fears of domestic communists abated, and a court ended the oath in 1967. The UC system subsequently adopted this policy: "No political test shall ever be considered in the appointment and promotion of any faculty member or employee."
Today, however, DEI statements are political litmus tests used in a baroque three-stage, five-point scoring system that winnows out applicants - sometimes most of them - before considering the applicants' academic qualifications. For example, eight departments in Berkeley's life sciences recently applied the DEI "rubric" in sorting through 893 eligible applicants.
First - yes, first - they were evaluated solely on "contributions" to diversity, equity and inclusion. This involved assessing, among much else, candidates' "comfort" in talking about those matters. Only 214 candidates who scored well in the diversity enthusiasm sweepstakes were then evaluated as scholars.
Most of the 679 who were immediately flunked received insufficient grades - only 1 or 2 points on the category "knowledge about" DEI (e.g., insufficient discussion of "gender or ethnicity/race") or 3 ("strong understanding of challenges" but "little understanding of demographic data"). Most survivors scored 4 or 5 on "comfort" and enthusiasm discussing the DEI agenda.
The second test concerned demonstrating a "track record in advancing" DEI. Those who fell at this hurdle perhaps showed only "limited participation at the periphery" of officially approved activities. The third test concerned "plans for advancing" DEI. Those who failed here might have been judged "vague" about the required political "activities." The fortunate few who scored 4 or 5, and so survived to have their scholarly credentials considered, presumably professed an impressive intention to strongly advocate the orthodoxy.
When Ms. Thompson published in the leading mathematics journal her criticism of mandatory DEI professions of loyalty, a Williams College mathematician, Chad M. Topaz, was enraged by this diversity of thought. He urged a digital mob to inflict on Ms. Thompson "some good 'ol public shame." He profits from the diversity industry: In exchange for "donations," he and associates will critique, and even help write, job candidates' diversity statements. This assistance will be "completely confidential." As befits ghostwritten political enthusiasm.
Because coast-to-coast academic culture is politically homogenized, other universities are adopting identical or similar requirements of "demonstrated commitments" to this and that, including "outreach," which presumably means something to those who speak academia's patois. Opaque language cannot, however, disguise that this is all politics.
Politics is how we organize our ideas and practices for living together. The defining characteristic of totalitarian societies is not that the individual cannot participate in politics, but that the individual cannot not participate. In such societies, politics permeates everything: Government's aim is the conquest of consciousness, and abstention from politics is subversive. Hence DEI pledges.
The Hoover Institution's John Cochrane, blogging as the Grumpy Economist, has publicized UC's practices, which he expects will become more onerous and invidious because universities continue hiring large numbers of diversity enforcers whose profession is to banish the classical liberal principle that every person should be treated as a unique individual. This banishment is a political project abetted by DEI statements, which are political tests. That they violate UC's stated policy prohibiting political tests means that the policy actually is: "Only progressive political tests shall be considered in appointments."

Aviation; Boeing Will Add New Fix To Appease Regulators

Texto completo: The wire bundles were so close together that, in rare circumstances, they could cause a short circuit and lead to a catastrophic failure.
Boeing's to-do list is getting longer.
Before the scheduled return of the 737 Max this summer, the aircraft manufacturer plans to separate wire bundles in the jet to assure regulators about the plane's safety, according to a source familiar with the company's plans who was not authorized to speak publicly about them.
The wire bundles have raised concerns because they could, in rare circumstances, cause a short circuit and possibly lead to a catastrophic failure. Boeing has argued privately to regulators that the likelihood of such a failure is remote.
Boeing had hoped to avoid having to uncover and separate the wiring, but concluded that global regulators' insistence on it might further delay the Max's return, the source said. Boeing could officially notify the Federal Aviation Administration of its plans as soon as this week.
The Max was grounded a year ago after it was involved in two crashes that killed a total of 346 people. The wire bundles were not implicated in those accidents, which have been linked to problems with a software system known as MCAS.
About 800 of the jets have been produced; half of them are in Boeing's possession, and its customers, primarily airlines, have the rest. Some of those customers could separate the bundles on their own, in consultation with the plane maker, the source said.
Boeing believes the separation will take about a week per plane and expects that it could be done alongside other tasks like checking fuel tanks and fluid levels, updating software and cleaning the planes in preparation for commercial service.
Before news of Boeing's plans was reported by Reuters on Wednesday afternoon, the company's share price fell 18 percent, more than any of the 29 other stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average.
In a letter to employees on Wednesday that was viewed by The New York Times, Dave Calhoun, Boeing's chief executive, and Greg Smith, its chief financial officer, told employees that the company was "now facing a global economic disruption" caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
As a result, they said, the company is freezing hiring and limiting travel and discretionary spending, restricting overtime to those working on the Max and other important projects. A person with knowledge of the matter said the carrier also planned to draw down a $ 13.8 billion credit line to shore up its cash position.
The plane maker also announced separately that it received 18 new orders for the Max last month and more than twice as many cancellations, some of which were converted into orders for other jets.
David Gelles contributed reporting.

Texto completo: The actor said he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive while in Australia, where he was set to begin production on a film.
LOS ANGELES -- The actor Tom Hanks said on Wednesday that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, have the coronavirus.
Mr. Hanks and Ms. Wilson, both 63, are in Australia, where he was set to film a movie about the life of Elvis Presley. "We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches," the Academy Award-winning actor said in a statement. "Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers, too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive."
He added that he and Ms. Wilson "will be tested, observed and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires."
"Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?" Mr. Hanks said in his statement, which he also posted on Instagram accompanied by a photograph of a lone medical glove in a hazardous waste container. "We'll keep the world posted and updated."
Mr. Hanks is by far the most prominent entertainment figure to say he has the virus and, by going public with the information, instantly becomes the face of an outbreak that has cascaded around the globe.
With the seriousness of the pandemic still being debated in some corners of the media, learning that Mr. Hanks, the star of films like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Apollo 13," has been stricken may make the situation seem much more tangible to some Americans. At virtually the same time that Mr. Hanks released his statement, the N.B.A. announced it was suspending its season. Hours before, the N.C.A.A. said its men's and women's basketball tournaments would be played without spectators.
Ann Curry, a journalist and former host of NBC's "Today," said on Twitter: "Ok, now we all have someone we love diagnosed with #coronavirus."
Other Hollywood stars immediately offered their support for the couple.
"Wishing two of the kindest, coolest, most talented people in the world ⁦⁦@tomhanks⁩ & @RitaWilson a swift recovery," Mia Farrow said on Twitter.
In the movie he was in Australia to film, Mr. Hanks is playing the role of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's eccentric manager, who groomed the famous singer for stardom in the 1950s.
Production on the film, which is being directed by Baz Luhrmann and does not yet have a title, is set to begin on Monday. Warner Bros., the studio behind the movie, has said it spans "over 20 years, from Presley's rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom, against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and the loss of innocence in America."
Mr. Luhrmann, an Australian, wrote the script with Craig Pearce, with whom he also wrote "The Great Gatsby" and "Moulin Rouge!" Australia has had more than 120 cases confirmed cases of coronavirus.
"The health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world," Warner said in a statement.
Warner has been among the Hollywood studios most affected by the coronavirus epidemic because of its large television production division, which makes more than 80 shows.
Also on Wednesday, Warner confirmed that it had suspended production of "Riverdale," a teenage drama based on Archie Comics characters that runs on the CW network, because of the coronavirus. "Riverdale" films in Vancouver, British Columbia.
"We have and will continue to take precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world," Warner said in its "Riverdale" statement.
In the United States, the number of cases has surpassed 1,150, and warnings about the safety of mass gatherings has begun to have tangible effects in the entertainment world. Daytime talk shows like "The View" and "Live With Kelly and Ryan" filmed without their usual studio audiences on Wednesday, and late-night shows based in New York, like "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," announced that they would go without studio audiences starting on Monday.
"The Ellen DeGeneres Show," a Warner production in Burbank, Calif., will also begin taping without a studio audience.

Texto completo: In a forum held as part of The Times's 1619 Project, a discussion among scholars underscores the role modern culture plays in how history evolves.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
As the scholar Karin Wulf points out, some people think history is "this known and knowable thing," a fixed quantity of information. Instead, she said, it's a continual process of discovery, "and it develops over time."
How big a role slavery played in the founding and early identity of America is one chapter of history that has evolved in recent decades and remains the subject of debate. Historians discussed that topic as well as how they examine evidence in a conversation moderated last Friday by Ms. Wulf, the executive director of the Omohundro Institute for Early American History & Culture, and organized by The New York Times Magazine.
The forum, "1619 Project Live," at TheTimesCenter, featured four scholars and professors who have focused on the American Revolution and slavery in early America: Annette Gordon-Reed of Harvard University, Eliga H. Gould of the University of New Hampshire, Gerald Horne of the University of Houston and Alan Taylor of the University of Virginia.
The program was an extension of the magazine's 1619 Project, an initiative started last year to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to the British North American colonies. The project included a series of articles in the magazine, a special section of the newspaper, a separate section for children, a five-part podcast and a curriculum developed for schools, all to better educate the public about the legacy of American slavery in our country. More public forums may be scheduled later this year in other cities.
The project has ignited important discussions about national identity and history, but there have also been criticisms. Some historians wrote to The Times expressing their reservations about crucial aspects of the project, particularly its interpretation that preserving slavery was among the motivations of the American colonies in seeking independence from England.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, a staff writer for the magazine who conceived of the 1619 Project, said she wanted readers to understand that the magazine articles were intended to be the beginning of a conversation, and that she hoped these forums incorporating a variety of voices would stimulate more dialogue.

"This project is an origin story. It is not pretending to be the origin story," she said. "We are talking about a particular moment in time and making an argument and really asking a question: What would it mean to imagine 1619 as an origin story and how would that help us understand the country that we are?"
Jake Silverstein, the editor in chief of the magazine, said it was important to incorporate the different viewpoints of historians in these forums. (The panelists on Friday were not involved in the original article.) "Part of what the project has really revealed and emphasized for us is how, by working closely together in a supportive way, historians and journalists can do a lot to illuminate the past," he said.
During Friday's program, Ms. Wulf spoke of the same connections. "What we understand about our history is the foundation for how we explain the present, the justification and the rationale for how we plan for the future," she said.
In discussing slavery in colonial times and its impact on the nation's founding, the historians said it was important to avoid narrowly defining the American Revolution as simply the war, and to view it instead as a long, complex movement that began in the 1760s. Mr. Gould added that both the experience and institution of slavery varied across British America. Mr. Horne stressed that the enslaved population "helped build this country."
Like Ms. Wulf, Ms. Gordon-Reed emphasized that the way we study history can change based on current customs. "Every historian is writing in terms of particular preoccupations of the time," she said. "Certainly the civil rights movement and changes in attitudes about women brought forth new understandings" in the way people looked at slavery and American identity. History, she said, is "never standing still."
But regardless of whether historians debate certain points, fostering these difficult discussions is valuable because they are not likely to be found in conventional books, Mr. Taylor said. "What the 1619 Project has done is offer us an unsettling narrative, but one that forces us to think," he said. "Even if we don't agree with parts of it, you're forced to think about the fundamentals of American history. And I think that's been immensely useful."

From Canceled Games To Business as Usual, Team Responses Vary

Texto completo: The N.B.A. abruptly suspended its season after a player tested positive for the coronavirus. The N.H.L., M.L.B. and men's tennis are also poised to make changes or have already done so.
A steady trickle of cancellations and other disruptions in the sports world caused by the coronavirus outbreak erupted into an avalanche on Wednesday, with the N.B.A. abruptly suspending its season and the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and other events barring most spectators. A major tennis tournament was also in doubt.
The N.B.A. acted after a player for the Utah Jazz, who had been listed as not playing, tested positive for the coronavirus, causing a moment of confusion before tip-off of a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The game was called off and the N.B.A. said the season would go on hiatus indefinitely.
Earlier, the Golden State Warriors had become the first N.B.A. team to bar fans from games because of the coronavirus pandemic, announcing that it would close the doors to spectators for Thursday's game against the Nets at Chase Center in San Francisco. The move foreshadowed sweeping changes across sports as public officials pressured teams to bar fans to help limit the spread of the virus.
At least 1,190 people in 41 states and Washington, D.C., have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database, and at least 37 patients with the virus have died. A majority of the cases were in Washington State, California and New York.
In parts of Washington State and California, large gatherings were restricted entirely. In states like Ohio, the authorities said similar orders were on the way. And the governing body of men's tennis was in discussions about suspending tour events, including the Miami Open, a major tournament, for six weeks, according to three people briefed on the discussions who were not authorized to speak about them publicly.
In Major League Baseball, the Seattle Mariners announced that they were working with the league to find alternative arrangements for home games at the end of March. The N.H.L.'s Columbus Blue Jackets said they would restrict attendance after the governor of Ohio announced that a ban on large gatherings was coming.
Before the N.B.A.'s suspended season, the biggest move had come from the N.C.A.A., which barred all but a limited gathering of family members and essential staff members at the men's and women's basketball championship tournaments set to begin next week.
The N.B.A.'s team owners held a conference call on Wednesday to decide what to do about their games, with the start of the playoffs just over a month away. The owners, according to a source familiar with the call, leaned toward playing in empty arenas for the rest of the season, but nothing was decided Wednesday night until news arrived that the Utah Jazz player had contracted the virus.
On Wednesday, after San Francisco moved to ban gatherings of more than 1,000 people for at least two weeks, the Warriors announced that Thursday's home game against the Nets would be played without spectators, and that all other events at the arena would be canceled or postponed through March 21.
The San Francisco Giants, who play at Oracle Park, said in a statement that they would cancel their only event at the stadium during that city's two-week ban on public gatherings -- a March 24 exhibition against the Oakland Athletics.
Santa Clara County, where the N.H.L.'s San Jose Sharks and M.L.S.'s San Jose Earthquakes play, announced a ban earlier in the week on gatherings of more than 1,000 people. The N.H.L. said in a statement, after the N.B.A. suspended its season, that it was evaluating its own plans for the season. Earlier, the league said it was working with the Sharks "to determine an appropriate course of action for home games through the end of the month."
In Washington State, Gov. Jay Inslee banned gatherings of more than 250 in multiple counties, including King County, which encompasses T-Mobile Park, the home stadium of the Seattle Mariners, and CenturyLink Field, where the Seattle Sounders FC of the M.L.S. play.
The Sounders said their March 21 match against FC Dallas, which was to take place at CenturyLink Field, would be postponed.
While many events in different industries have been canceled or changed because of the health crisis, attention sharply shifted to the sports world on Wednesday after Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, put the sports leagues on notice in an appearance before lawmakers.
"We would recommend that there not be large crowds," Dr. Fauci said. "If that means not having any people in the audience when the N.B.A. plays, so be it. But as a public health official, anything that has large crowds is something that would give a risk to spread."
Still, the N.B.A. had seemed determined all day to carry on in some capacity.
In Washington, D.C., despite a recommendation from the Department of Health that large gatherings be postponed or canceled, Monumental Sports and Entertainment, the ownership group of the Washington Wizards and the N.H.L.'s Washington Capitals, said its home games would be played as scheduled "at the current direction" of both leagues.
"Should they update their guidance, we will update the public accordingly," the ownership group said in a statement.
Likewise, a spokesperson for Madison Square Garden, which owns the N.B.A.'s Knicks and the N.H.L.'s Rangers, said, "The remainder of our calendar is moving forward as scheduled."
The N.B.A. and the N.H.L. could face the most direct immediate financial hit of not playing. The M.L.B. season is not slated to begin until the end of March, and N.F.L. players are in the middle of their off-season, though the draft is slated to begin on April 23 in Las Vegas. The W.N.B.A. draft is on April 17, and the season begins May 15.
"It's a developing story," Rick Welts, the president and chief operating officer of the Warriors, said before the league's suspension. "We don't know how it's going to end."

Next Chore for Putin's Kremlin: Selling the Public on a New Czar

Texto completo: 'Do you want an eternal Putin?' a critic asked after Parliament paved the way for the president to serve well beyond the end of his current term.
MOSCOW -- One of Russia's most influential business magnates on Wednesday said the country has become a "quasi-monarchy" -- a sign of how President Vladimir V. Putin's move this week to clear the way to rule until 2036 has changed the landscape of Russian politics.
Not that the magnate, Konstantin Malofeev, was complaining.
A nationalist financier with Kremlin connections and his own TV channel, Mr. Malofeev has spent decades agitating for a restoration of royal rule. In an interview with The New York Times, he said that after this week's flurry of events, he had never been closer to his goal.
"The quasi-monarchy that we basically now have is a very good thing," Mr. Malofeev said at his ornate office on Moscow's Garden Ring. Referring to Mr. Putin, he went on: "If we were now to start calling him emperor, not president, then we wouldn't have to change much in the Constitution."
In a tightly choreographed bit of political theater this week, the 67-year-old Mr. Putin gave himself the option of ruling for two additional six-year terms when his current tenure expires in 2024. Now comes the harder part for the Kremlin: persuading Russians to accept their new czar.
Daria Rtishcheva, a 24-year-old working in the clothing manufacturing business in Moscow, noted that she would be 40 years old in 2036.
"And Putin will still be there," she said in an interview outside a fashionable Moscow department store. "It drives me a bit crazy."
On Wednesday, Russia's upper house of Parliament approved a constitutional amendment that was introduced the day before in the lower house and then endorsed by Mr. Putin. The amendment would reset the clock on the Constitution's limit of two presidential terms for Mr. Putin if he runs again in 2024.
The Kremlin's powerful propaganda machine swung into action. The possibility that Mr. Putin could rule for 16 more years, the refrain went, was what Russians needed to keep them safe.
While Mr. Putin had been widely expected to look for a way to hold on to power, some Russians were looking ahead to 2024 as a possible moment of political renewal.
The message in the pro-Kremlin news media Wednesday was that Mr. Putin had chosen a democratic path to preserving stability in Russia by keeping himself in power.
Mr. Putin emphasized that the amendment allowing him to run again would need to be approved by the Constitutional Court and by a nationwide vote. The April 22 plebiscite had already been scheduled as a vote on other, less consequential constitutional amendments that Mr. Putin introduced earlier this year.
"The president's proposal that these amendments be put to a nationwide vote is a very wise and, at the same time, a very bold decision," Konstantin Dolgov, a senior lawmaker in Russia's upper house, said on state television. "It is a decision that truly confirms our president's adherence to the fundamental democratic foundations of the development of our country and our society."
Success in the plebiscite and in the Constitutional Court appears assured, however, given the Kremlin's control of the judiciary and the electoral system.
Putin backers also deployed the familiar argument that Western countries bent on weakening Russia were rooting for Mr. Putin to step down. Had Mr. Putin agreed to leave in 2024, then something like the liberal perestroika reforms of the late 1980s would be in the offing, said Russia's biggest tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda.
"Perestroika is canceled," a Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist wrote. "Life goes on. Thank God."
Mr. Putin may still be vulnerable, however, because of a sputtering economy and long-simmering public anger over economic inequality and official corruption. Opposition activists, taking advantage of the proliferation of high-speed internet access to get around the Kremlin's control of the television airwaves, have pushed the message that Mr. Putin has allowed his wealthy friends to plunder Russia's riches.
"Do you want an eternal Putin?" Sergei Udaltsov, a far-left Kremlin critic, said in a YouTube address Wednesday. "Do you want to die under Putin and his whole Kremlin band?"
Mr. Udaltsov said he was prepared to urge people to cast "no" ballots in the April plebiscite rather than boycotting it, since this week's developments had turned the previously scheduled vote into a referendum on Mr. Putin's continued leadership.
But Vladimir Milov, an adviser to the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he did not expect the Navalny team to mount a vigorous campaign one way or the other ahead of the vote.
The rules under which the vote will be conducted will make it difficult to monitor, and easily falsified, Mr. Milov said. And since Mr. Putin's newfound ability to run again four years from now does not mean any near-term change, Mr. Milov does not see the constitutional amendments catalyzing major rallies.
"All that's happening now will very much contribute to discrediting the leadership's image and the decline of its overall legitimacy," Mr. Milov said. "But the potential for these events to mobilize protests is low."
Nikita Nevedimov, a 31-year-old Muscovite who works in marketing, said that he disapproved of the decision to allow Mr. Putin to run again and that he was generally unhappy with the political situation in the country. But he said he had no plans to vote in the plebiscite or to join any protests.
"There's probably not that much panic, because many people understand that the president doesn't have a super-big influence on your private, personal life," Mr. Nevedimov said. "On the whole, everything was moving toward this. There wasn't much surprise."
But for Mr. Malofeev, the magnate, this has been a big week.
He is one of the most prominent conservatives in Russia's Kremlin-allied elite, and helps drum up support for Mr. Putin on the Russian right. He is under United States and European Union sanctions amid accusations that he financed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. (Mr. Malofeev denies those allegations.)
"This isn't the end," Mr. Malofeev said. "The introduction of a constitutional monarchy in the foreseeable future -- for instance, after Putin's rule in 2036 -- has become realistic."
Sophia Kishkovsky, Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.

Texto completo: Readers analyze the reasons for Joe Biden's momentum and offer critiques of both candidates.
To the Editor:
Re "Biden Captures 3 States to Seize Command" (front page, March 11):
As the latest primary results would seem to indicate, Democrats now have a clear strategic path to defeating President Trump. Critical to that victory, however, is the realization that a "movement" and a "campaign" are not the same thing.
Bernie Sanders (as he likes to say) is leading a movement -- a movement for democratic structural change that would benefit the vast majority of working people in the country. Joe Biden is clearly leading a campaign to end the Trump presidency.
These are not contradictory pursuits. In fact, in this perilous political moment, they must coalesce not only to end the Trump presidency but also to further fuel Bernie's movement for change.
Too much is at stake in this election cycle to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Joseph Delia

To the Editor:
Re "The Limits of the Working-Class Hero Pitch" (news article, March 10):
What's disturbing about Bernie Sanders isn't his ideology. It's his demagogy.
Yes, we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels; bring down prescription drug costs and provide affordable health care to all; restrain banks from making risky investments; raise taxes on the top 1 percent.
Mr. Sanders's mantra? The fossil fuel industry is greedy and corrupt. The pharmaceutical industry is greedy and corrupt. The insurance industry is greedy and corrupt. The big banks are greedy and corrupt. The wealthy are greedy and corrupt.
It's little wonder "the establishment" is flocking to Joe Biden. So are millions of Americans employed by oil and gas companies, pharmaceutical companies, the insurance industry, banks and others demonized by Mr. Sanders, who are rightly scared they'll lose their jobs if he's elected.
Voters deserve solutions, not scapegoats. Mr. Sanders should leave the politics of fearmongering to Donald Trump.
Rick Sinding

To the Editor:
Watching Joe Biden's convincing victories in the primaries on Tuesday left me somewhat despondent. I understand the "electability" and "socialism" concerns about Bernie Sanders, but while the return to normalcy that Mr. Biden offers may be welcome to some, it's also a potentially boring future. I don't doubt Mr. Biden's fundamental decency and intentions, but I have little faith that he will (or can) do much to fundamentally change this country's wrenching inequalities and inequities.
Mr. Biden should not assume progressives will come out to vote for him. I may not. Progressives may stay home if Mr. Biden chooses an establishment running mate.
There is one way for Mr. Biden to bring out the progressive vote and win: Choose a progressive (preferably female) running mate. Given socialism concerns about Mr. Sanders, that candidate could be Elizabeth Warren.
Quentin Eichbaum

To the Editor:
Re "Sanders Spreads Blame for His Falling Behind" (news article, March 11):
President Trump attacks any critical coverage of his presidency as "fake news." Bernie Sanders attacks a "corporate media" that failed to give his campaign sufficient (by which he meant positive) coverage. Besides sharing the impulse to attack journalists, both men seem to be susceptible to the playground habit of blaming others if blame seems called for.
Mr. Sanders helped deliver Mr. Trump into the White House once. The possibility that he could do it again has not deterred him. Perhaps hubris and the attraction to power are also characteristics he shares with Mr. Trump.
Sharon Pywell
West Newton, Mass.
To the Editor:
"Why Southerners Saved Biden," by Mara Gay (Opinion, March 6), suggests that voters see Joe Biden as more electable despite his gaffes. It is understandable that the idea of beating President Trump is first on their list of objectives, but the argument that he is the safer choice might be misguided.
Mr. Biden won votes by stoking fear of the words "socialism" and "revolution." He persuaded voters to overlook his record supporting the Iraq war and advocating for cuts to Medicare and Social Security benefits.
I would argue that a more electable candidate is one who can think on his feet. A more electable candidate is one who can clearly articulate why corruption is an issue, and who can competently respond in the moment to President Trump's lies, ridicule and name-calling. We need a candidate who can do more than look confused when asked a direct policy question.
Don't think Mr. Trump won't pounce on Mr. Biden for his less-than-stellar record and memory lapses.

Texto completo: A drama about the Manson cult airs on Showtime. And the Dixie Chicks perform on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."
What's on TV
CHARLIE SAYS (2019) 9 p.m. on Showtime. Mary Harron vacillates between prison and movie ranch in "Charlie Says," her drama about the Charles Manson cult. Though she is best known as the director of the satirical serial-killer study "American Psycho," Harron here pays relatively little attention to Manson himself (played by Matt Smith), instead focusing on three of his female followers (played by Hannah Murray, Marianne Rendón and Sosie Bacon). That trio tells the story here. The movie shows them both during their time with Manson and after the fact, in prison, where they recount their story to a graduate student (Karlene Faith, played by Merritt Wever). "It's a tough, difficult story that, anchored by Guinevere Turner's script, Harron recounts with lucid calm, compassion and intelligent interpretive license," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "She revisits some of the familiar locations, including the dusty California ranch where the Manson family set up house, and she carefully restages some of the murders. For those familiar with the horrific details of those crimes, the movie may seem wholly uninviting, but bear with Harron -- she has something to say."
THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT 11:35 p.m. on CBS. Last week, the Dixie Chicks released the title track of their latest record, "Gaslighter," which will be the group's first new album since 2006. They will be interviewed and perform on "The Late Show" on Thursday night in support of that album. Also in the lineup: the author Michael Pollan, who recently released an audiobook about caffeine.
What's Streaming
CONTAGION (2011) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "I paid $ 12.99 to watch a 10-year-old movie," the director Barry Jenkins told The Times earlier this month. "I've never done that before." He was referring to this Steven Soderbergh thriller, and he's not alone: As worry about the Covid-19 outbreak has mounted, "Contagion" has been climbing the streaming charts. Revisit it to see Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law and others play characters contending with the global outbreak of a deadly, thankfully fictional virus.
SHOP CLASS Stream on Disney Plus. If you'd prefer good-natured rivalry to pandemic scares, consider turning instead to this new competition show, which pairs teams of young builders and shop teachers against each other in elaborate construction challenges. Justin Long hosts.
BEACH RATS (2017) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Eliza Hittman is back in theaters this weekend with "Never Rarely Sometimes Always," a drama about a teenager who travels to New York City for an abortion. Her previous feature, "Beach Rats," also centers on a teenager. This one, Frankie (Harris Dickinson), spends much of the movie grappling with his sexuality, his relationships and his family. Hittman's portrait of Frankie, Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times, "doubles as a portrait of Brooklyn's southern-shore neighborhoods, lyrically photographed by Hélène Louvart."

Texto completo: THE ECONOMY
The Coronavirus Is Hitting Consumer Confidence
The spread of the coronavirus, along with the tumult it is stirring in financial markets, has begun to drag on consumer confidence, according to a nationwide poll conducted by the online research firm SurveyMonkey for The New York Times.
The poll found the largest single-month drop in confidence since President Trump took office, driven by rising concern about the nation's economic outlook.
Still, more people (44 percent) expected good or somewhat good business conditions in the coming year than those who expected bad or somewhat bad conditions (23 percent).
The polling was begun last week and completed on Sunday, so it does not reflect any further impact from this week's market upheaval.
High consumer confidence has buoyed Mr. Trump's presidency. But Mr. Trump's performance rating in the survey slipped this month, with 51 percent of respondents registering disapproval -- including 40 percent who disapproved strongly of how he was handling the job.
AUTOMOBILES
Fiat Chrysler May Shutter Factories in Italy
Fiat Chrysler warned Wednesday that it may close some of its factories in Italy because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has hit the country especially hard.
Any closures would be for health reasons, not because of problems getting parts or raw materials needed to keep assembly lines running, a Fiat spokesman said.
Fiat's announcement suggests that the need to keep workers from infecting one another could be a bigger problem for carmakers and other manufacturers than disruption to supply chains.
LEGAL
Lawyers Wonder: Is the Outbreak an Act of God?
Big law firms have been churning out client notes advising business executives to start paying attention to force majeure clauses in contracts with vendors, subcontractors and insurers. Such clauses are common in contracts to protect parties in the event of a so-called act of God -- earthquakes, hurricanes or floods -- that prevent one side from completing its end of a deal, or disrupts a company's business for an extended period.
But these clauses often do not include provisions for things like epidemics or pandemics. So will a force majeure clause provide legal protection to a company that cannot perform a contractual task because it had to effectively shut down by the coronavirus?
Well, lawyers said, it often depends on the specific facts of each situation. Judges have tended to enforce such provisions narrowly and want to see evidence that a company did everything possible to keep up its end of the bargain. Courts are reluctant to interpret a force majeure clause as a "get out of jail free" card for a company that simply fails to perform.
Companies might want to protect themselves by coming up with contingency plans to demonstrate they did everything possible to complete a contractual obligation, Paul Weiss, the big New York law firm, said in a client note.

Texto completo: Gonzalo Casals of the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art wants to increase opportunities for people like him, in "immigrant communities, queer communities, Latinx communities."
If there is a museum director who embodies Mayor Bill de Blasio's commitment to empowerment and inclusion, it is Gonzalo Casals, who leads the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art in SoHo, which is devoted to queer art. Now the mayor has given Mr. Casals a new title: New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, for the largest local funder of arts and culture in the United States.
"Art and culture should enrich the lives of all New Yorkers -- not just a select few," Mayor de Blasio said in a statement. "Gonzalo understands how to uplift the experiences of New Yorkers from all five boroughs."
Mr. Casals is an immigrant from Argentina who identifies as queer. Since 2017, he has led the Leslie-Lohman, a museum with roots in the L.G.B.T.Q. civil rights movement, diversifying its collection and programming with contributions from the gay community. Mr. Casals previously served as deputy and interim director at El Museo del Barrio in East Harlem, a major center for Latino art and culture, where he stepped in after Margarita Aguilar left amid turmoil.
"I look forward to continuing to further the work that the agency has been doing," Mr. Casals, who starts April 13, said in a telephone interview. "Opening up opportunities in the sector for folks like me -- immigrant communities, queer communities, Latinx communities."
Mr. Casals also served as vice president for education and community engagement at Friends of the High Line, which focused on the elevated railway's effect on surrounding neighborhoods. "He taught me and the board that we need to think about community engagement in every part of the organization, not just through programming," said Robert Hammond, a co-founder and executive director of the High Line. "He is exactly what New York needs right now."
Mr. Casals replaces Tom Finkelpearl, who stepped down in October after five years as Commissioner, amid a controversy over replacing the city's monuments with more women and people of color.
The mayor and Mr. Finkelpearl maintained that their decision to part ways was mutual. But Mr. de Blasio found himself having to defend against critics who condemned the city's decision not to make the nun Mother Cabrini one of its first new statues (they included the actor Chazz Palminteri, who called the mayor's wife, Chirlane McCray, a "racist").
During Mr. Finkelpearl's tenure, the city's cultural budget increased more than 35 percent, to $ 211.6 million for fiscal year 2020, from $ 156.1 million for 2014. And the city's first comprehensive cultural plan, unveiled in 2017, tied its funding to the diversity of arts institutions' employees and board members.
While Mr. Finkelpearl was a mild-mannered leader who eschewed the back-channeling, brass-knuckled negotiating of municipal politics, Mr. Casals is widely described as an activist, comfortable stepping into the fray.
"He is not afraid to challenge institutions and traditional power structures," said Jimmy Van Bramer of Queens, chairman of the City Council committee that oversees cultural affairs. "He's a thinker but he's also a fighter."
Adam D. Weinberg, the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, called Mr. Casals a "seasoned and passionate arts advocate" with "strong values."
At the Leslie-Lohman Museum, Mr. Casals has overseen shows such as "On Our Backs: The Revolutionary Art of Queer Sex Work" last fall, which focused on the lives of sex workers in the L.G.B.T.Q. community and featured pieces by artists who themselves worked as prostitutes.
"The museum has a history it can be proud of, a radical one," The New York Times critic Holland Cotter wrote in his review of another exhibition, "Found: Queer Archaeology; Queer Abstraction." "From the start, it championed an outcast art and stood boldly, unfashionably, by it," Mr. Cotter wrote. "Now it is complicating its earlier aesthetic direction without compromising its social mission, which is a tough act to pull off."
The museum dates to 1969, when Charles W. Leslie and his partner Fritz Lohman began showing work by gay artists in their loft. "It's very important for mainstream museums -- not just for cultural specific museums like mine -- to show that work," Mr. Casals said in 2017, speaking of exhibitions dealing with gender fluidity. "The best way you can alienate a community is by denying them their reflection in society."
Mr. Casals, who came to New York City from Buenos Aires in 2002, has served on a number of city commissions and task forces, including the Mayoral Advisory Commission on City Art, Monuments, and Markers, which developed guidelines for rethinking monuments "seen as oppressive and inconsistent with the values of New York City." He also played an official advisory role during the public engagement process for the cultural plan, CreateNYC.
An active community resident of Jackson Heights, Queens, Mr. Casals teaches at the City University of New York, Yale University and New York University.
"I'm taking this appointment extremely seriously," Mr. Casals said. "Making sure I send the message that these communities and other marginal communities understand their stories matter."

Texto completo: On the day the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, warnings from other officials compounded the anxiety.
So did the numbers on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell into bear market territory. The S&P 500 sank nearly 5 percent while the Dow lost nearly 6 percent. The sell-off reflected investors' sense that governments had not moved fast enough to safeguard people or the economy.
Looking ahead, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that "it is going to get worse." And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany made the stark prediction that about two-thirds of Germans could become infected.
More than 120,000 people have been infected worldwide, and more than 4,300 have died. In the United States, there have been at least 31 deaths.
The numbers from Italy soared again on Wednesday, to more than 12,460 cases, jumping more than 2,000 from Tuesday. Italy has reported 827 deaths, second only to China. Confirmed cases climbed on Wednesday to almost 2,300 in France and almost 2,200 in Spain, each up about 500 from Tuesday. Iran's death toll rose by 62, to 354.
The Democratic Republic of Congo and the Ivory Coast reported their first cases. Just last week, Congolese officials announced that the last Ebola patient from an outbreak that began 19 months ago had finally gone home from the hospital.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo confirmed 39 additional cases of the coronavirus, bringing the state's total to 212. More than half, 121 cases, were in Westchester County, just north of New York City. The city itself had 48 confirmed cases, with 12 new cases reported on Wednesday. New Jersey added eight new cases of the virus, bringing its total to 23.
China, where the pandemic began, now appears concerned that the coronavirus could re-enter from abroad -- five of the 24 new cases that China reported on Wednesday arrived from Italy and one from the United States. Beijing's city government announced that overseas visitors would be quarantined for 14 days.
India closed the country's borders, and Guatemala said it would bar Europeans beginning on Thursday.
The World Health Organization had avoided using the term pandemic -- a word that denotes danger and risk -- as the virus hopscotched from country to country. "Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly," Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the W.H.O., said at a news conference in Geneva.
But by Wednesday there was evidence on six continents of sustained transmission of the virus, and that met the agency's definition of a pandemic as "the worldwide spread of a new disease" affecting large numbers of people. The W.H.O. had not declared a pandemic since the H1N1 influenza outbreak 11 years ago.
Italy, under lockdown with more than 800 deaths and more than 6,800 people hospitalized, considered imposing even tighter restrictions as officials announced they would provide $ 28 billion in financial relief. Britain's government announced a $ 39 billion economic stimulus package, and the Bank of England slashed its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.25 percent.
In Germany, with small businesses worried about potentially calamitous losses, Ms. Merkel indicated that she was open to dropping a rule that had precluded new government borrowing. "This is an exceptional situation, and we will do whatever is needed," she said. "We won't ask every day, 'What does this mean for our deficit?"'
Like other officials, she said it was important to stay home whenever possible. Large cultural performances in Berlin and Munich, as well as many soccer games elsewhere, have been canceled or will go on without an audience.
In the United States, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky called on churches across the state to cancel worship services this weekend. "I don't believe whether you go to church during this period of time is a test of faith," he said. "I believe God gives us wisdom to protect each other, and we should do that."
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, where 25 coronavirus patients have died, ordered a ban on gatherings that would bring more than 250 people together in the Seattle area -- parades, concerts and festivals. The ban will be in effect through March, which could disrupt the opening of the baseball season. "This is not just your ordinary flu," Mr. Inslee said. "This demands a response consistent with the nature of the threat."
The Seattle Mariners, who had been scheduled to play the Texas Rangers in Seattle on March 26, said in a statement on Wednesday that they would work with the Rangers and Major League Baseball to find an alternative.
San Francisco banned gatherings of 1,000 people or more for the next two weeks, including Golden State Warriors basketball games.
Chicago canceled its St. Patrick's Day parade, as did Boston and Philadelphia. And District of Columbia health officials recommended that all "non-essential mass gatherings, including conferences and conventions," be delayed or canceled for at least the rest of the month. That could play havoc with the National Cherry Blossom Festival, which usually draws more than a million people to the nation's capital.
The list of colleges and universities that sent students home and made plans to hold classes online grew. Mr. Cuomo, the New York governor, said that New York's state and city public university systems would move to mostly online classes on March 19. In announcing a similar move, the president of the University of Virginia, James E. Ryan, said the school would not hold conventional classes "for the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester." Penn State and the University of Wisconsin at Madison also announced plans for remote classes.
There were signs that the outbreak was undercutting consumer confidence. A nationwide poll conducted by the online research firm SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found the largest single-month drop in confidence since President Trump took office. Nearly three-quarters of those questioned -- 73 percent -- are worried that the coronavirus outbreak will have a negative economic effect.
About as many people approved of the way Mr. Trump has handled the federal government's response to the coronavirus as disapproved: 47 percent said they approved, while 48 percent said they disapproved.

Texto completo: The challenge "is to demonstrate how voting can affect the daily lives of these young Americans," a reader writes. Also: President Trump's efforts against human trafficking; investing in science.
To the Editor:
Re "Inspiring Young Voters, but Not Enough to Push Them to the Ballot Box" (news article, March 5):
I am writing to offer further context about the emerging electorate and their lack of participation at the voting booth. The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation recently published the largest study ever of nonvoters, which included a close look at voting-eligible Americans ages 18 to 24.
The study shows that we could potentially be losing a generation of voters. They report a substantially lower interest in politics generally and in voting in 2020 even than Americans who chronically don't vote. The top reasons cited by those who said they will not vote are that they don't care about politics and they don't like the candidates.
The challenge -- not only to candidates like Bernie Sanders but to the democratic system as well -- is to demonstrate how voting can affect the daily lives of these young Americans. Until they feel the impact that participation can have, it's unlikely that they'll show up in force at the polls.

To the Editor:
Michael Bloomberg should fund a PAC, a series of scholarships or some other effort with the primary goal of getting young people actively involved in liberal politics at every level.
The future of the Democrats and democracy rests on a young, committed electorate. This will be especially important in winning races in the Senate and the House. It will also develop a pool of young, liberal lawyers, some of whom will eventually move into the judicial system.

Defending Trump's Efforts to Stop Human Trafficking
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Exploits Kids Exploited by Sex Trade" (column, Feb. 27):
Nicholas Kristof tries to undermine the outstanding accomplishments of the Trump administration in the fight against human trafficking.
He claims that the administration's efforts to combat trafficking is "less about protecting children and more about exalting Trump," and that the administration "has also made no attempt to address underlying causes of trafficking."
Mr. Kristof's assertions are wrong.
President Trump has signed nine pieces of anti-trafficking legislation. Ivanka Trump, his daughter and adviser, hosted a summit in January where the president announced a White House staff position devoted to combating domestic trafficking. Through the administration's Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team, federal law enforcement obtained more than 500 convictions of human traffickers in 2018 and increased the number of defendants charged by 75 percent in ACTeam districts.
Mr. Trump also proposes a budget above congressional levels to support state and local efforts to combat trafficking.
Mr. Kristof should talk to those of us on the front lines fighting this scourge so we can set the record straight on the additional resources the Trump administration has delivered to assist victims and prosecute traffickers.

Let's Commit to Invest in Science
To the Editor:
Re "Silicon Valley Needs the Government" (Op-Ed, Feb. 28):
Eric Schmidt, the former chairman and C.E.O. of Google, rightly warns that the United States is no longer the uncontested leader in science and technology -- strengths that competitor countries like China are methodically bolstering to meet economic and other strategic objectives.
As he asserts, it's time for our government to step up with an innovation-fueling strategy of our own. Mr. Schmidt has his finger on the pulse of public sentiment in this regard.
We know from our recently commissioned public opinion survey that a majority of Americans -- across party lines -- support investing in research for job creation, economic growth and global competitiveness. We know that they "get" the value of government-financed noncommercial research and private-sector research and development alike. What are we waiting for?
Let's double our commitment to all federal science agencies over five years and design policies that will support the public-private partnerships Mr. Schmidt calls for. We can't afford not to.

Coronavirus in the age of "truthiness"

Texto completo: There’s an old song by The O’Jays that seems especially apropos to this moment. The refrain goes: “Those lies done caught up with you this time.”
The song was about a faithless lover getting her comeuppance. But it also works as a verdict on so-called conservatives in an age of looming pandemic.
At this writing, there have been, according to a New York Times database, 747 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 – caused by the novel coronavirus – in the United States; 26 of the afflicted have died. Meantime, the stock market has dropped like a boulder from a cliff, colleges are canceling classes, sports leagues are preparing to play in empty arenas. Internationally, 114,000 people have been stricken. All of Italy is on lockdown, Spain has shuttered every nursery school, high school and university in and around Madrid and a St. Patrick’s Day parade has been called off – in Dublin.
Those are the grim facts. But the view from inside the facts- resistant bubble that passes for conservatism these days is quite different.
If you live in there, you’ve heard Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh assure you that the virus that has galvanized doctors around the world is really just “the common cold” weaponized to hurt Donald Trump. You’ve seen Rep. Matt Gaetz mock concerns over the virus by wearing a gas mask in the Capitol; he has since had to self-quarantine after a possible exposure. Meantime, King Liar himself, Trump, keeps doing what comes naturally.
He said a vaccine will be ready in just a few months. It won’t.
He said the number of Americans afflicted is going down. It isn’t.
He said anyone who needs a test can get one. They can’t.
He said that the World Health Organization gave “a false number” in predicting a global mortality rate of 3.4%. And on what basis did he question a respected international organization of medical professionals? Trump said he had a “hunch.”
Then there’s this recent tweet from writer Jelani Cobb of The New Yorker: “Overheard from the person in front of me on line at CPAC last week: ‘I don’t believe anything the CDC says about this virus. It’s full of deep staters who want to use this to create a recession to bring down the president.’” As it happens, it was at CPAC – the annual Conservative Political Action Conference – that Gaetz was apparently exposed.
You can’t make this stuff up. But that doesn’t stop right-wingers from trying.
It was in 2005 that Stephen Colbert coined the word “truthiness” to describe the then-new phenomenon of Americans prioritizing information they “felt” to be true over that which objectively was. Though restricted to no ideology, truthiness was much more common and – through a nexus of cable news, the internet and various integrity-free politicians – much more encouraged on the political right.
In 2005, the danger of this may have felt somewhat abstract – a decline in the quality of political discourse. But by 2016, when a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside a Washington pizzeria because he believed a debunked anti-Hillary Clinton conspiracy theory, it was already glaringly clear that “alternative facts” could have dangerous, real-world implications.
Now there is this. One wonders if it will be the breaking point; if, faced with direct risk to their own lives, conservatives will finally quit suckling at the teat of mass delusion. Let’s hope so, for all our sake. A virus, after all, respects no ideological borders, so the right wing’s refusal to respect reality puts everyone at risk.
With apologies to The O’Jays, those lies done caught up with us all.

The Russians are coming (again)

Texto completo: The Russians are like the devil. Each gets blamed (or credited) with more than they are responsible for.
Intelligence officials recently went to Capitol Hill where, according to The Hill, “they briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia interfering in the presidential race in an effort to get Trump reelected.” The initial presumption was that Russian President Vladimir Putin favors Trump’s reelection. Why would he when he has someone more closely associated with his ideology than Trump? That would be the self-described Democratic Socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
But wait. Following closely on this unspecific leak to (where else?) The New York Times, we now hear that Russia wants Sanders as the next president. Perhaps it’s out of gratitude because he and his wife honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Ah, nostalgia.
The intelligence briefing was classified, but as with charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, no details have emerged that prove the Russian “collusion” narrative. Other than disinformation campaigns on social media (and plenty of disinformation has and will continue to be generated here at home through mainstream media) we have still not heard any specifics on how Russia managed to change a single vote in 2016, or how they supposedly intend to do so this time around. Upon hearing of the intelligence briefing, Putin’s press secretary told Russian state-run media, “This is another in a series of paranoid reports, and we regret to say that their number will grow as the election approaches. They certainly have nothing to do with the truth.”
The reason Democrats are again raising the prospect of Russian interference is to undermine the credibility of this year’s election should Trump win again, as seems increasingly likely. Democrats have been unable to stomach, not only his 2016 election, but also his economic successes. They fear their party will lose what remaining but dwindling appeal it might still enjoy. That’s why in the debates among Democratic presidential candidates one hears of an America that isn’t recognizable to most citizens. For them, America is a bad country, a place of racism, sexism, inequality and misery only they can fix, though previous Democratic presidents who have made similar diagnoses of America’s “faults” have done nothing to repair the damage to which they have arguably contributed. Trump appears to have stolen their issues and they have no fallback position.
As for the credibility of American intelligence, consider their record during George W. Bush’s administration, beginning with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which were never found, resulting in the deaths of many in the unnecessary war that followed.
This Russian interference claim seems like a setup and an invitation for the House to conduct even more investigations and possibly new articles of impeachment after the election, assuming Democrats maintain their House majority. A recent Gallup poll shows record high approval (49%) of the president’s policies. Forty-three percent of independents polled now support the president – the highest percentage during Trump’s entire presidency. We’ll see if that translates into Republican victories in races for the Senate and House.
According to Gallup, “The latest survey finds a further increase in national satisfaction, with 45 percent now satisfied, the highest since February 2005.”
Democrats have always needed a boogeyman to run against. Recall “The Gingrich who stole Christmas” line disparaging then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on a Time magazine cover in the 1990s. Democrats have also demagogued Republicans for not helping the poor and for being racist. That is a harder sell with the African-American unemployment rate at record lows and wages rising for virtually all groups. According to the Census Bureau, the poverty level is as low as its been in 11 years.
Russia has become the default boogeyman of the left. That is what makes Bernie Sanders the ideal candidate for Russia and the other socialist-communist states he has praised, because in his heart he is at one with them.

Texto completo: There were no protesters or picketers. Just roughly 1,800 people - couples on date nights, clusters of young men, boomer parents with their millennial kids - lined up on a downtown Washington block, eager to watch Louis C.K. tell jokes.
Inside the Warner Theatre on Sunday, some in the sold-out crowd chanted his name, as if to summon him, and they stood on their feet when C.K. materialized. "I love you, Louie!" shouted a guy, who at 8:30 p.m., already had too much to drink.
C.K. walked out in his familiar black T-shirt and jeans. He gently said hello and greeted the crowd. "How are ya? How was your . . . last couple of years?" he said, to laughs. "How was 2018 and 2019 for you guys? Anyone else get in global amounts of trouble?"
The last time C.K. performed in a D.C. theater, he confidently strutted on the stage in a suit and tie and immediately launched into an abortion joke. He was filming his 2017 Netflix special and had been at the top of the comedy world, winning Emmys, doing interviews with Terry Gross and hosting "Saturday Night Live." He had an audience that trusted him to draw humor from the darkest corners of human existence.
Then the #MeToo movement took off and the New York Times published allegations about C.K. He admitted that the rumors about him, the ones he'd denied for years, were true: He'd masturbated in front of female colleagues. His longtime manager dropped him, his movie release was scrapped and his broad FX deal evaporated. For many fans, suddenly his jokes about consent and power dynamics completely changed. No longer did they see C.K. as a man they could offer the benefit of the doubt.
But not for everybody. C.K. may no longer be a celebrated auteur, but he still has an audience. He sold out two nights in D.C., and people went to great lengths to see him. They paid for tickets and babysitters. They drove from Delaware. They, despite the coronavirus, willingly crammed into a room with a bunch of strangers with unknown hand-washing habits. Then they laughed at the new material delivered by C.K., who appears to be preparing for a future special; cameras positioned around the theater filmed for a project called "Louis C.K. Live."
He told outrageous and shocking jokes, the kind that made him famous, "but look around: everybody's happy," audience member Josh Kline said after the show. "Because we know how to take a joke."
The comedian's return to stand-up has been intensely scrutinized; nine months after he promised to stop talking and listen, he did a surprise drop-in set at his old haunt, New York's Comedy Cellar, sparking a larger conversation about disgraced men quietly returning to their professions. He went abroad - though he wished he could have left the planet, he joked on Sunday - and eventually performed in U.S. clubs, honing a new act. Some of those sets leaked and jokes about Parkland shooting survivors, Asian men and gender identity caused outrage. Headlines declared C.K. wasn't atoning, but taking a turn to right-wing comedy.
He has since scrapped those jokes and what remains in his theater act is the standard C.K. fare. The meaninglessness of -life, death, pedophilia, saying the R-word a bunch - it's not new terrain for him. He still delights in saying things that seem unmentionable. The audience expected him to push their limits, and he did; they tensed up at a line about the Boston Marathon bombing, but then he won them back.
Performing on Sunday, he didn't come off as bombastic, nor as apologetic. He talked briefly about "it," referring to his misconduct; he had a bit that acknowledged the power dynamic that sometimes women will say they're okay even when they aren't in order to survive. (He was working out a version of this joke years ago.) Mostly his jokes about the scandal came from the point of view of someone ostracized - he mimes eating alone in a restaurant while getting flipped off from someone across the room - and the crowd cheered.
It was a crowd that included plenty of men, women, and young and old people. And they weren't all die-hard fans, buying tickets to prove some point: The Post spoke with a dozen who attended Sunday's show, and only one of them had seen him live before. Unprompted, they noted they liked how C.K. addressed the elephant in the room, but they mostly talked about how he delivered on their expectations.
"He carried himself well," said Sarah Burr. "It was the quintessential Louis C.K." The outlandish material? "Ha, yes, that's his go-to, and pretty standard for a comedian, period."
"He's kind of at the top of his game," said Will Hickman. "I think his ordeal that he went through may be good for him."
Unlike actors or other entertainers whose projects involve a lot of other people, a stand-up comic's work is more solitary, and performers can cultivate a direct relationship with their audience. C.K. spent years growing his email list, and pioneered self-releasing specials, which fans could purchase directly from him.
Now he's using that email list, or what remains of it, to announce tour dates. Some are in far-flung places (Slovakia) or smaller venues (Houston's Improv) than he used to play, others in major theaters (Boston's Orpheum).
"I'm excited to get back on the road," he wrote in a recent email. "I really enjoy performing standup comedy very much."
And there are still people who really enjoy listening to him, too.

Texto completo: That was a bear-y short introduction.
Wednesday's "Masked Singer" introduced the final group of six competitors, vying for three spots in the "Super 9. " (A trio of competitors from Groups A and B have already been chosen. )
At the top of the show, host Nick Cannon rubbed it in the faces of the panel – Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger and Robin Thicke – that they've guessed right only twice in six episodes this season.
Cannon also divulged tips on the stars in the latest group: "Between them they have one Guinness World Record, two Time magazine's "Most Influential People" honors, three New York Times best-sellers and 36 gold records.

Night Angel
Clues: Night Angel appeared at a motel for her debut package. The contestant opened the doors for rooms four, five and six and had a keychain marked with the number 2. Behind one door, there were people wearing duck bills on their faces; behind another, people partied. Night Angel also said that it's her "prerogative to have a little fun, y'all," before performing Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name. "
Guesses: Thicke thought of singer/songwriter Taylor Dayne, while McCarthy pictured singer Monica and Scherzinger suspected rapper Lil' Kim.
Bear
Clues: Bear spoke of her critics and being "sick" over people not knowing the real her. She said that she was choosing to come out of hibernation, and also mentioned having cubs (children). A pair of hockey skates and a bowl of french fries were highlighted in the package.
Guesses: After hearing Bear's version of Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back," Jeong mentioned former ice skater Tonya Harding and singer Britney Spears. McCarthy believed it could be actress Candace Cameron Bure and Thicke imagined it was comedian Tina Fey under the costume.

Astronaut
Clues: The out-of-this-world Astronaut "always dreamt of flying high," he said in his clue package that showed him flying through space. After crash-landing to Earth, Astronaut admitted it was "not a pitch-perfect landing" but was ready to entertain with Lauren Daigle's "You Say. " Objects shown included a lei, a witch's broom and a toolbox. After performing, Astronaut revealed he "started at a young age. "
Guesses: Jeong threw out actor Josh Hutcherson and McCarthy thought of singer Lance Bass. Scherzinger guessed actor Zac Efron.
T-Rex
Clues: The T-Rex said she was "plucked. . . out of obscurity" and was "one of dozens of talented creatures. . . all similar in looks, strength and skill, a sisterhood of fun and friends," hinting that she may have been part of a competition. Objects that appeared to have significance: a baby doll, and the letters N and W were circled on a display of the cardinal directions.
Guesses: T-Rex's performance of Pink's "So What" had Jeong envisioning reality star Kourtney Kardashian. McCarthy pictured dancer Maddie Ziegler and Scherzinger thought of "Friday" singer Rebecca Black.
Rhino
Clues: Between the trees, the challenger described himself as "a gentle giant" who was used to being "center stage" as a young rhino. He said "being on top became an addiction," and after not being in the No. 1 spot, he "crashed and burned. " But, thankfully, Rhino received "the help I needed to get back on my ride," and was "ready to soar again. "
Butterflies were highlighted in the package, as well as a guitar, with the text "Grand Ole Opry" written on it.
Guesses: Rhino's performance of John Hiatt's "Have a Little Faith in Me," made McCarthy and Scherzinger think of country stars Jason Aldean and Tim McGraw, respectively. But it made Jeong picture former football player (and current minor-league baseball player) Tim Tebow.
Swan
Clues: Swan said she "refused to be tuned out" in her clue package, which also included a man with a megaphone and a ballet bar. A man was also shown with a mouth full of vampire teeth, and we saw a ghost haunting a tree.
Guesses: Following Swan's "Fever" by Peggy Lee, Jeong guessed "Vampire Diaries" star Nina Dobrev was beneath the costume, but became envious of Scherzinger's feeling that it could be actress Jennifer Love Hewitt. Thicke believed it could be "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" star Sarah Michelle Gellar.
The Elimination
Bear was cut from the competition, revealing a famous face that left McCarthy "stunned beyond belief. "
For their final guesses, Thicke and McCarthy stuck with their original guesses of Fey and Cameron Bure, respectively. Jeong thought of the latter's "Fuller House" co-star Jodie Sweetin, while Scherzinger picked Christina Applegate.
It seems Thicke was the closest with Fey, as the bear was actually former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, whom Fey has impersonated. Palin said she chose the Bear because it referenced her nickname growing up, adding that she is a mama bear, and its presence in her home state.
"This is the weirdest thing I've ever done, that's for sure," said Palin. "But it's all about fun. It's unity. "
"This is what our country needs right now, too," she added.

US states race to contain coronavirus as cases exceed 1,000

Texto completo: The coronavirus outbreak is colliding with the presidential election and the ramifications are being felt on the campaign trail and at polling places.
“Campaigning and conventions could change," said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California Irvine's law school, raising the possibility of virtual nominating conventions this summer if the outbreak continues.
The effects were clear Tuesday night, when former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders both canceled election night rallies in Cleveland after Ohio's governor discouraged large gatherings. On Wednesday, Biden's campaign said it had formed a six-person public health advisory committee to provide “expert advice regarding steps the campaign should take to minimize health risks for the candidate, staff, and supporters."
After consulting with those experts and at the request of local officials, the Biden campaign announced it was shifting “large crowd" events scheduled for Friday in Chicago and Monday in Miami to “virtual events."
At the same time, state election officials are taking steps to adjust voting procedures to keep the virus from spreading. Washington state told voters not to lick the envelopes of their absentee ballots,
Ohio is moving polling places for next Tuesday's primary from senior centers to avoid infecting older people, and Chicago will make paper ballots available for voters who don't want to use touch screen machines in the Illinois primary, also next week.
Ohio also will allow curbside ballot drop-off so people can minimize face-to-face contact and will provide money for polling places where local officials aren't able to buy hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes to clean the voting machines. Acton encouraged at-risk people to vote early to avoid crowds.
President Trump likes to hold large rallies and is scheduled to launch his “Catholics for Trump" coalition on March 19 in Milwaukee, an event that his campaign said “will bring together Catholics from across the nation." Vice President Mike Pence was pressed Tuesday about whether he and Trump would cancel rallies to protect attendees.
“That will be a decision that's made literally on a day-to-day basis," Pence told reporters.
Pence also has said he and Trump will continue to shake hands, despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid doing so during viral outbreaks.

Gatherings of 250 or more banned in Seattle area
SEATTLE — Governor Jay Inslee of Washington on Wednesday ordered a ban on parades, concerts, festivals, and other gatherings of 250 or more people in the Seattle area as the state escalates its response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The order, one of the strictest imposed in any US city so far, is an attempt to reduce social interactions to limit further spread of a virus that has already killed 24 people in the state.
Hours later, Seattle public schools announced they would close all their facilities for at least the next two weeks.
“It is clear that our state needs a more vigorous and more comprehensive and more aggressive position if we are to slow the spread of this epidemic," Inslee said. The governor said the decision was not easy and that the efforts to combat coronavirus were going to be “profoundly disturbing to a lot of the ways that we live our lives."
Earlier in the week, officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., also declared a ban on public gatherings, in that case, of 1,000 people or more. In New Rochelle, N.Y., Governor Andrew Cuomo this week designated a 1-mile radius “containment area" around part of the city.
The prohibition in Washington state applies to King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties, an area that includes the cities of Seattle, Tacoma, and Everett.
It runs through the end of March, which would likely disrupt the opening of the Major League Baseball season.
The Seattle Mariners are set to play their first home game in Seattle on March 26.

Hanks and Wilson say they have the virus
NEW YORK — Tom Hanks and his actress-singer wife Rita Wilson have tested positive for the coronavirus, the actor said in a statement Wednesday.
Hanks said the couple were in Australia and felt tired, with colds, body aches, and slight fevers. "To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus and were found to be positive," Hanks said.
The 63-year-old Oscar-winner said they will be “tested, observed and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires."
“Not much more to it than a one-day-a-time approach, no?" added Hanks.
Hanks had been in Australia shooting an untitled Elvis Presley biopic directed by Baz Luhrmann. Hanks plays Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker. The film is currently slated for release in October 2021.
Hanks and Wilson, 63, were married in 1988. In 2013, Hanks disclosed that he has type 2 diabetes.

Like others, Chicago cancels St. Patrick's Day parade
CHICAGO — Chicago on Wednesday joined the ranks of cities around the world to scrap St. Patrick's Day parades amid concerns about spread of the new coronavirus, calling off an event that attracts tens of thousands of revelers who line the streets, pack themselves into pubs, and peer into a river that every year is turned bright green.
Chicago's mayor said she couldn't risk the kind of gathering that scientists warn could hasten the further spread of Covid-19.
“Like cities across the nation, we concluded that having a parade at this time posed an unnecessary risk to the public's health," Mayor Lori Lightfoot told reporters at a news conference with a supportive Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.
Chicago's parade had been scheduled for Saturday, ahead of St. Patrick's Day on Tuesday.
"We all know what the St. Patrick's Day celebrations mean to the city of Chicago," said Pritzker, a Democrat.
“Because of what we've seen nationally, and across the world, of the increased risk of large gatherings, this was the right call."
Indeed, it was deemed the right call in cities from Boston and Philadelphia to Denver and San Francisco. The cities of Dublin — the one in Ohio and the one in Ireland — also pulled the plugs on their parades.

Texto completo: For the foreseeable future, MinnPost will be providing daily updates on coronavirus in Minnesota, primarily from the press phone call conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) each afternoon.
Two new cases in Minnesota
As the World Health Organization declared a global coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday, Minnesota announced its fourth and fifth confirmed cases of COVID-19.
Both of Wednesday’s confirmed cases have international travel history that likely explains the patients’ exposure to the coronavirus.
One is an Olmsted County resident in their 50s who is believed to have been symptomatic at work. Infectious Disease Director Kris Ehresmann said MDH is working with the person’s workplace, and is most concerned with exposure for anyone who was within 6 feet of the infected person for more than 10 minutes. The Olmsted County patient had symptoms beginning March 5 and sought care and testing March 9.
A Ramsey County resident in their 30s was also confirmed to have COVID-19 Wednesday. The person is believed to have only been in direct contact with household members. The person had symptoms beginning March 6 and sought care and testing on March 10.
Both patients are recovering at home.
The state’s third confirmed COVID-19 case, an Anoka County resident in their 30s who tested positive Tuesday, remains in critical condition, Ehresmann said.
UMN suspends in-person classes
The University of Minnesota suspended in-person instruction Wednesday, President Joan Gabel announced Wednesday afternoon in an email to students, faculty and staff.
There are no confirmed cases in the university system, but the step is being taken as a precautionary measure. The Duluth, Rochester and Twin Cities campuses are currently on spring break, which is being extended. When instruction resumes on March 18, classes will be conducted online.
The Morris and Crookston campuses, scheduled to begin spring break next week, will have classes through Friday and move online thereafter. And classes on all campuses will be taught remotely through at least April 1. Residence and dining halls and student services will remain open for now.
Response moves into ‘community mitigation’ mode
While the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Minnesota is limited, Ehresmann said the Department of Health is moving its messaging beyond the containment strategy — isolating cases and potential contacts — and into community mitigation, which means taking measures like encouraging people to limit large events to slow the potential spread of the virus.
No community transmission has been identified in Minnesota, but lack of testing availability (which is being increased), has slowed the state’s ability to identify cases, Ehresmann said.
She stressed that community mitigation isn’t a switch — like an all-out cancellation of large events — but rather a dial. “We want to start turning the dial and start preparing to move into that community mitigation mode.”
Ehresmann recommended people in the high-risk category — those who are older, immunosuppressed, or have underlying health conditions — consider avoiding large group settings and practice social distancing, including staying at least 6 feet away from others.
So far, Ehresmann said people who have tested positive for COVID-19 have been receptive to quarantine measures. “What is concerning is the fact that people are not staying home when they’re sick,” she said. “What we really need is for people to stay home when they’re sick so we don’t have the potential for unnecessary spread.”

Texto completo: Ida Maney "Sissy" Nash
Louisville - Ida Maney "Sissy" Nash of Prospect, Kentucky, died at home surrounded by family on March 10, 2020 of complications arising from a pulmonary disease. She was born on December 10, 1928, in Louisville, the daughter of Col. Frank Barton Thompson and Ida Maney Webb Thompson. She is preceded in death by her husband, Robert McLean Nash, her parents, her sister, Margaret Becker, and her two younger brothers, Frank and James "Buddy" Thompson. She was an Episcopalian and a member of Calvary Episcopal Church.
Sissy graduated from Louisville Collegiate School and Hollins College, and shortly thereafter married fellow Louisvillian Bobby Nash. Sissy and Bobby shared a lifelong, loving relationship that spanned the next 56 years, building a magnificent garden and farm that was the joy of their lives. They were fortunate to share this with their three children, four grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
Sissy was always an active volunteer and advocate for many public and private causes. Over the course of her life, she served on many boards including the Louisville Ballet, St. Francis High School, and the Speed Museum. Sissy was fiercely patriotic, fair minded and appreciative of all the gifts and opportunities she was given, and she felt strongly that it was the duty of all citizens to support and to improve the place in which they lived.
At a time when downtown Louisville was experiencing significant urban decline, Sissy spearheaded several important preservation projects as well as fundraising events for these projects to demonstrate the usefulness and uniqueness of neglected and abandoned historic buildings in downtown Louisville.
For example, in 1974, as a member of the Junior League of Louisville, she was asked to find a new headquarters and to lead its fundraising, restoration and decoration of the new building. By selecting an abandoned warehouse at 627 West Main Street, it was Sissy's intention to bring revitalization and preservation interest back to Downtown. For her exceptional work with this building called Stairways, Sissy received the League's Founders Fund Award and national recognition. Her work with the Broadway Project and her collaborative adaptive reuse project of 600 W. Main into a premier office building are further examples of her desire to bring people and interest out of the suburbs and back into the city.
Sissy felt that in order for the city to be a desirable place to live, it needed strong creative and performing arts. Sissy's gift was fundraising and she put her boundless energy and style toward organizing many galas and events including the first Speed Ball, first Bourbon Ball, and first Ballet Ball.
However, it was Sissy's love of gardening, inherited from her mother and grandfather, that really set a high bar horticulturally in Louisville. The same hard work and commitment she brought to bear in her civic undertakings contributed to her creation of what is considered one of the most important gardens in the region. Longfield has been featured in several books and countless articles in many publications including the New York Times.
On their beautiful farm, Sissy and Bobby were gracious, welcoming hosts to friends, family and children of all ages. Sissy's beauty, joie de vivre, style, incredible work ethic, high standards, fierce loyalty to family and friends, and vast array of interests made her an admired and beloved woman. She truly believed the quote she kept on her desk, written by JFK: "Every person can make a difference, and every person should try."
She is survived by her three daughters: Margaret Nash (Martin Violette), Louise Gardner (Michael), and Kathy Cary (Will); four grandchildren, Julie Evans (Matt), Charlie Farnsley (Mindy), Lilly Cary, and Will Cary; and six great granddaughters.
A memorial service will be held at 4:00 p.m. on Monday, March 16th at Calvary Episcopal Church, 821 S. Fourth Street with private burial in Cave Hill. Visitation will be from 2:00 â€" 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, March 15th at Pearson's, 149 Breckenridge Lane. Live streaming may take place; please see update in Saturday's Courier Journal Obituary page.
In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy can be made to Filson Historical Society, Cabbage Patch Settlement House, and Hosparus Health of Louisville.

Texto completo: As of 1 p.m. Friday, March 13, test results show that two Maine residents have tested presumptive positive for the coronavirus. Click here for the latest coronavirus news, which the BDN has made free for the public. You can support this mission by purchasing a digital subscription.
With the coronavirus rapidly spreading across the U.S. and more than 100 confirmed cases elsewhere in New England, Maine's hospitals say that they have been preparing for its expected arrival in the state, even if they do not know how soon it will be.
They've been taking stock of supplies such as face masks, respirators and ventilators, isolating patients who exhibit symptoms associated with the virus and regularly consulting with government health officials and other hospitals about the spread of the illness.
Many of those preparations are no different from what they have done in response to flu season and previous pandemics.
[Do you have questions about the coronavirus? Ask us here.]
But unlike with influenza, hospital administrators also said that there is still great uncertainty about COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and that there is particular concern for its effects on vulnerable populations such as those with suppressed immune systems.
"The community should feel very comfortable that health care providers [in Bangor] are used to planning for" similar scenarios, said Mary Prybylo, president and CEO of St. Joseph Healthcare in Bangor. "We are prepared, but we know it's evolving and changing."
As an example of the way that St. Joe's has had to adjust its response to the illness, Prybylo said the hospital previously screened patients for COVID-19 by isolating them in a room, assessing them for the infection and then treating them. Now, the hospital is encouraging patients to not come to the emergency department, but to call ahead for their screening.
While no cases of COVID-19 have been detected yet in Maine, health officials expect it to arrive here eventually. There is "every reason to believe" there will be a confirmed case in Maine, Jeff Doran, vice president of clinical services for Northern Light Health, a group of 10 Maine hospitals headquartered in Brewer, said last week after a briefing from state health officials.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said earlier this week that there is a "possibility" it is circulating here already and that hospitals have been advised to prepare as though it is.
As of Wednesday afternoon, 42 of the 47 tests done by the state had come back negative and five were still pending. But the number of confirmed cases elsewhere in New England has swelled to more than 100 in just a few days -- with 92 of them in Massachusetts -- according to the New York Times.
[Here's what has been canceled or postponed in Maine due to coronavirus]
Representatives from some of the state's hospitals said they have been considering what resources might be in short supply if there was an influx of patients, whether it is beds, staffing or oxygen tanks.
For example, Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor has been identifying areas in the hospital where groups of patients with the same respiratory infection could be isolated and treated while minimizing the spread of their illness, according to Dr. James Jarvis, EMMC's senior vice president and senior physician executive.
"We've already prepared to do those things if we had a bad outbreak" of an illness, Jarvis said. "We have the ability to do that. It's a matter of scaling that to meet the needs of the community."
If there was a surge of cases of COVID-19 somewhere in Maine, it could put a strain on certain types of supplies such as specialized face masks, according to both Jarvis and Prybylo. Mask shortages have been a particular problem at hospitals in Washington state, which has been heavily hit by the virus, according to the Washington Post.
To that end, Jarvis and Pybylo said their hospitals have been keeping close tabs on their inventory and are prepared to work with suppliers if such a shortage appears to be on the horizon. It's also been on the radar of MaineHealth, the parent group of Maine Medical Center in Portland and several other hospitals across the state.
"We have plans in place and stockpiles of extra supplies in place for events like this," said John Porter, MaineHealth's associate vice president of communications and public affairs.
But without any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Maine, hospital administrators said they have not yet taken more serious steps to expand their capacity, such as delaying elective procedures in order to free up patient beds or bringing in nurses from affiliated facilities.
They also urged Mainers to focus on preventive measures, such as washing their hands frequently and coughing into their elbows. They encouraged anyone worried they may have a virus to stay home from work and to call their health care providers rather than showing up in person.
Prybylo also cautioned anyone with chronic illnesses or poor immune systems to avoid large crowds. "I would probably not go to the hockey game at UMaine," she said. "I wouldn't go to New York City. I would try and stay away from large crowds. If I was a regular goer to church or synagogue, I might decide to stay at home."

Maine has still not confirmed through testing any cases of the coronavirus in the state, but it's continuing to test more people and is setting up a hotline to answer Mainers' questions about the infection, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Of the 47 tests so far done by the state, 42 have come back negative, according to the Maine CDC. It posted those results on its website at noon on Wednesday. However, Maine CDC is still waiting for the results of another five tests that it has also done, according to its website.
On Tuesday, the Maine CDC also announced that it was rolling out a new hotline available to Mainers with questions about COVID-19, the disease caused by the infection.
The hotline is available by calling 211 or 1-866-811-5695. It can also be reached by texting your zipcode to 898-211 or emailing info@211maine.org.
[Do you have questions about the coronavirus? Ask us here.]
The new COVID-19 testing figures released Wednesday by the Maine CDC show that the total number of completed tests nearly doubled between Tuesday and Wednesday. As of Tuesday afternoon, the state had just 20 confirmed test results and another five pending samples.
The overnight bump in test results comes as COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe and country.
Since originating in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, it has spread to at least 100 countries, according to data collected by the New York Times. More than 1,000 cases of the virus were reported in the U.S. as of Wednesday morning, including at least 31 deaths related to it, according to the New York Times.
On Wednesday, COVID-19 was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
Maine remains the only state in New England to not have any confirmed cases of the disease. Ninety-two confirmed cases were reported in Massachusetts as of Tuesday, according to the Boston Globe. As of the same time, New Hampshire and Rhode Island had each reported 5, Connecticut had reported 2 and Vermont had reported 1, according to the New York Times.

'Not a Russia-only problem’: Intelligence community disputes media’s 2020 interference reports

Texto completo: National security officials told lawmakers on Tuesday the intelligence community has not concluded Russia is backing any particular 2020 candidate while warning about meddling from multiple countries.
The information that appeared in an unclassified fact sheet from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which coordinates the nation’s 17 intelligence agencies, rejects a stream of media reports on classified briefings on election security.

“The IC has not concluded that the Kremlin is directly aiding any candidate’s reelection or any other candidates’ election. Nor have we concluded that the Russians will definitely choose to try to do so in 2020,” the fact sheet read. “This is not a Russia-only problem. China, Iran, other countries like North Korea and Cuba, and non-state actors all have the opportunity, means, and potential motive to interfere in the 2020 elections as a way to achieve their goals.”
This statement counters anonymously sourced media reports in which unnamed sources said the intelligence community concluded Russia was helping President Trump with reelection and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont win the Democratic primaries.

The ODNI said Tuesday that “Russian social media and state media messaging has taken aim at some of the candidates from both parties, in part to signal Russia’s unhappiness with policy statements or choices” and “we expect that the intent of hostile state actors toward the 2020 election will evolve as the election nears.”

William Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, conducted the ODNI portion of the briefing and was joined by FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf.
Last month, the intelligence community disputed information the media were given about a classified House Intelligence Committee briefing, with officials denying that lawmakers were told Russia is attempting to help Trump in 2020.
“We cannot comment on classified briefings, but what we can tell you is that Shelby did not say Russia is aiding the reelection of President Trump,” an ODNI spokesperson told the Washington Examiner.
That briefing took place on Feb. 13 and was conducted in part by Shelby Pierson, the election threats executive under then-acting DNI Joseph Maguire. Since then, Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell took over as acting spy chief, and Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas was renominated to take on the position permanently. He awaits Senate confirmation.

According to sources cited by the New York Times, Pierson warned “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected.”
Trump called it “another misinformation campaign” last month.
“Nobody briefed me about that at all,” Trump said. “They leaked it, Adam Schiff and his group.”
Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted that “your false claims fool no one” and “you’ve betrayed America — again.”
Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien has repeatedly insisted he has not seen any intelligence showing Russia was trying to get Trump reelected.
The Washington Post published a piece last month citing sources claiming U.S. officials told Sanders that “Russia is attempting to help his presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the Democratic contest.”

In response, Sanders said, “The Russians want to undermine American democracy by dividing us up and, unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts.”
On Tuesday, the intelligence community also drew attention to Chinese and Iranian foreign influence, claiming “Beijing continues to promote policies that are in line with China’s interests” and “China may consider more aggressive or expansive activity if bilateral relations significantly worsen” while warning that “we must not underestimate Iran, which maintains a robust cyber program.”
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence provided lawmakers with “talking points” on election security, noting that “we have made considerable strides since 2016 to improve and expand our capacity and capabilities in securing the U.S. elections.” The intelligence community said, “As a result of the interference in the 2016 presidential election and the very real threats to our elections that still exist, the U.S. government has marshaled an unprecedented level of support to state and local officials, political campaigns, and the private sector.”
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation concluded “the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion” but “did not establish” any conspiracy between Trump and Russia.
The ODNI also pushed back Tuesday against a Washington Post report that cited sources claiming that Grenell “has declined to appear before Congress … to speak about foreign election threats, citing apprehension about his preparedness to address sensitive subjects that tend to upset the president.”
The intelligence office called this “erroneous” because the office “did not communicate to Congress at any point” that Grenell would participate in election security briefings. The ODNI said the FBI and Homeland Security Department “are the lead in charge of securing our elections” and that the intelligence community participated in the briefings “in support of that mission” and “is focused on detecting and countering foreign election-related threats.”

Grenell himself tweeted that the story was “not remotely true.”
“But I know in D.C. you are allowed to use ‘anonymous sources’ who don’t know the facts (or don’t even exist) as pretend sources,” he added. “The American people are tired of the manipulation.”

Texto completo: A New York Times editor attributed the fallout from her mathematical gaffe on MSNBC to racism in a recent op-ed.
Mara Gay, a member of the New York Times editorial board, mistakenly claimed last week that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg could have given a million dollars to every American with the $500 million he spent on his abortive presidential campaign. “Somebody tweeted recently that, actually, with the money he spent, he could have given every American a million dollars," Gay said.
“It’s an incredible way of putting it. It’s true. It’s disturbing. It does suggest what we’re talking about here: There is too much money in politics," she later added.
Gay acknowledged that her initial reaction was to joke about how her math didn't add up, writing, "Given my history with math, I thought the flub was pretty funny, too. I tried to laugh it off. 'Buying a calculator,' I wrote on Twitter on Friday. 'Brb.'" She then went on to suggest critics may have had a racial animus in the comments they made to her.
"What’s it like when people are trying to cancel you for a math mistake? Weird, and maddening and painful," Gay wrote. "Of course, in my case it wasn’t really about math, as anyone who read through my mentions on Twitter or saw my inbox would know," she continued.
Gay cited emails from "ring wing trolls" where people emailed her racist messages. “You’re a great example of why we need to end Affirmative Action. Get a job scrubbing floors. It’s the only thing you’re good for," she claims one email read while another simply said, "Have a banana."
The public experience, Gay says, was comparable to the media's reactions to Monica Lewinsky's sexual encounters with President Bill Clinton, reminding herself that she was legacy of black Americans who were persecuted against during the era of Jim Crow.
"I am here because of them. And there is nothing the haters can do about it," she wrote.

PolitiFact fact-checks obvious joke about Hillary Clinton

Texto completo: The absolute worst media trend of the Trump era has been the war on jokes.

From Snopes fact-checking the Babylon Bee to the New York Times writing entire reports on the dangers of political comedy, nothing has been dumber these last three years than the media’s vilification of humor.

It should not go unnoticed, by the way, that the news media’s newfound concern for political satire is reserved almost entirely for jokes told by people on the Right.
Consider, for example, PolitiFact's fact-check this week of Republican Wisconsin state Rep. Gae Magnafici.
On March 7, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Molly Beck tweeted a Washington Post report with the headline “How the Trump administration squandered time and lost control of the coronavirus crisis.”

Former Wisconsin legislator Adam Jarchow responded to the tweeted story with one word, “Crisis?”

To his question, Magnafici chimed in, saying, “More people have died from knowing Hillary."Tweet
As of this writing, her tweet, obviously a reference to a running online gag about the Clinton body count, has been shared by six social media users. Exactly 25 people have "liked" it.
If you can believe it, Magnafici’s clowning on the failed two-time presidential candidate landed the state representative in hot water with the media fact-checking group PolitiFact, which awarded her tweet a “Pants on Fire” rating.
“As America’s coronavirus death toll hit 19 and the number of cases topped 400 on March 7, one Wisconsin branch of Twitter wasn’t exactly taking the matter seriously,” reads the nearly 500-word fact-check.
It continues, reading:
It started innocuously enough with a tweet from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Molly Beck. She shared a link to a Washington Post story that said President Donald Trump’s administration squandered time and "lost control of the coronavirus crisis." Former Wisconsin legislator Adam Jarchow retweeted that, adding "Crisis?" It’s a question Trump has repeatedly raised as well in minimizing the impact of the virus.
The story adds that it was Magnafici’s response to Jarchow that “jumped off the screen.”
“Jumped off the screen”? Six people have shared it, and 25 people have liked it. No one even saw the damn joke, let alone enough to call for an entire fact-check.
Magnafici’s office told PolitiFact that her remark was “clearly a joke.” That this needed to be clarified is a little sad. Then again, it seems clear the fact-checker is looking just to nail the state representative for whatever it can find.
Her office “didn’t respond when asked what in the context would have signaled this was a joke, or whether Magnafici considers the coronavirus a serious matter,” PolitiFact said, adding later that the state representative should know better considering her background in healthcare.
Oh, come on.
“Magnafici, a longtime nurse now serving as a state legislator, responded to a coronavirus post on Twitter by saying ‘more people have died from knowing Hillary.’ A staffer later said she was 'clearly' joking,” PolitiFact concluded in its final ruling.
It added, “But the claim, aside from making no logical sense, came in response to a serious post and had no accompanying context indicating it was meant as some kind of satire. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.”
Thank you, PolitiFact, for not getting satire or social media. Your clueless efforts mean that the republic will live on for another day.

Warren expected to withhold endorsements from Biden and Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is expected to withhold her endorsement for the remaining presidential candidates during the Democratic Party's nominating process.
Warren is unlikely to endorse either Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden during the remainder of the Democratic primary, according to the New York Times. Warren has been reticent on the matter since the two publicly brawled in January over whether Sanders said a woman couldn't win the presidency.
"Anybody who knows me knows that it’s incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States," he said. "Go to YouTube today. There’s a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the United States," Sanders responded, addressing the matter in a January Democratic primary debate.
Following the debate, Warren confronted Sanders over his denial. "I think you called me a liar on national TV," Warren said to Sanders, with Sanders promptly ending the discussion. "Let's not do it now," Sanders said.
However, after the Super Tuesday elections, Warren has spoken to Sanders multiple times and with Biden only once.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent supporter of Sanders, told the New York Times that she understands Warren's hesitancy to endorse either candidate.“I always want to see us come together as a progressive wing,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think that’s important and where we draw strength from. But, at the same time, I come from the lens of an organizer, and if someone doesn’t do what you want, you don’t blame them — you ask why. And you don’t demand that answer of that person — you reflect. And that reflection is where you can grow.”
Warren did not endorse Sanders when he ran against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, either, adding to speculation that she may remain neutral. "That was the template that she designed in 2016,” said Brian Fallon, a former employee of Clinton's, to the New York Times. “Wait back, hold until the nomination is settled, and then be very practical and hard-boiled about what your asks are.”

How lawmakers can proactively protect communities from pandemic threats

Texto completo: Concerns over the potential impact of the coronavirus on the U.S. populace and economy are growing. In the event of a widespread outbreak, the nation’s hospitals will become ground zero, absorbing the massive responsibility of treatment and containment.
Unfortunately, the availability of hospital beds in 38 states is limited by arcane laws called "certificate of need." Rather than allowing a hospital to be built, adding beds to an existing hospital, or offering some types of new technologies, many states require that these additions be approved by a board of existing competitors with every incentive to restrict new competition from opening or expanding.
Imagine if an Aldi or Whole Foods wanted to build a grocery store or begin offering some new products in your community, but Publix and Kroger were in charge of deciding if the new store’s plans would be approved. As absurd as this situation would be, this is exactly what happens when it comes to hospital capacities in more than two-thirds of states nationwide.
In a new study released this week by the Regulatory Transparency Project of the Federalist Society, Christina Sandefur points out that “38 states still have [certificate of need] laws on their books, and continue to require government approval before building or expanding a healthcare facility or service — approval that can hinge on whether existing hospitals are willing to allow others to enter the market to compete against them.”
We shouldn’t have to wait until there is a looming public health threat to recognize that these crony laws serve to artificially prop up hospitals’ bottom lines at the expense of public well-being and preparedness. As China’s construction of a 1,000-bed isolation hospital in 10 days made international news, leading analysts in the U.S. acknowledged that our bureaucratic system would prevent from responding with similar urgency.
The United States has approximately 900,000 hospital beds, of which the CDC claims about two-thirds are regularly occupied. The World Health Organization estimates “about 80% of coronavirus cases are mild, with others serious or critical”, according to Robert Cyran of Reuters. “So if just 1% of America’s population of 330 million contracted the virus at the same time, there wouldn’t be enough hospital beds. An uneven outbreak could lead to more overcrowding in some cities and critical-care units.”
Indeed, this dynamic is exactly what’s being blamed for the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, where the death tolls have been much higher than other parts of the country. “Stretched medical systems will kill more patients… countries with poor medical care will be hit harder,” explains Cyran. "They lack the ability to find clusters of disease and dampen the outbreak, while patients won’t be treated."
Yet even as consensus builds towards assuming that certain high-density areas in the U.S. like New York City are nearly guaranteed to be at risk of real public health threats as a result of the coronavirus contagion, city officials weighing hospital bed capacities are demonstrating an apathy towards proactive reforms that would better assure their treatment facilities are ready. The New York Times recently questioned Mayor Bill De Blasio about what would happen if the 1,200 beds currently available to treat affected patients were filled, and he responded, “We’ve got a long time to ramp up if we ever had anything like that.”
State lawmakers have both the authority and the duty to put patients first. They should do so by bringing urgent legislation to immediately remove certificate of need laws, allowing healthcare providers to fully examine how they may expand to meet new demands. Lawmakers shouldn’t wait until there is public health emergency to respond. They must act now.

What the Harvey Weinsteins of the world took away from us

Texto completo: Sentenced on Wednesday to nearly a quarter century of prison time, rapist Harvey Weinstein will likely die behind bars. At long last, the justice system has bent for the righteous, not the ruling class. And still, at just half the length of his tenure of raping his way across Hollywood and Manhattan, it feels like too little, too late.
An old Chinese proverb says that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second-best time is now. Better late than never that Weinstein finally faced justice, and it was in a manner that might just revolutionize how seriously the justice system takes contemporaneously corroborating witnesses and enforces the rule of law against serial predators.
Even though Weinstein was ultimately sentenced to 23 years in prison, he could have faced as little as five. In its request for sentencing leniency, Weinstein's defense team argued, "Mr. Weinstein’s commercial success and contribution to the arts and entertainment industry are certainly well known."
Yes, the monster made or at least contributed to beautiful pieces of art such as Shakespeare In Love and Kill Bill. But what about the question few ever dare to ask: How much art, work, and humanity did he deprive us of in the process?
There's a New York Times op-ed I haven't stopped thinking of since October wherein comedian Kelly Bachman confronted Weinstein in the audience of Downtime NYC, where she was performing. Bachman was actually booed by members of the crowd for calling out Weinstein and sharing that she herself was a rape victim. But women around the world made the clip of her performance go viral. Recounting her own rape trauma, Bachman wrote in the New York Times:
I wonder how many relationships, good grades, good schools, happy days, fun parties, job opportunities and even joyful moments onstage I’ve missed because of rapists. I think about that a lot: lost time... I’ve felt robbed of a decade of my life, because I know that the amount of time I’ve spent thinking about three horrible nights of my life is probably the amount of time I could’ve been laughing with an audience. Now I’m 27 years old, and I finally feel that I have the strength to use my voice. I feel lucky that I’ve found it again this soon. I feel lucky to have found positive communities and support. Not all survivors are so lucky.
Weinstein tried to warn us that we'd lose whatever Scary Movie sequel he'd produce next, but that ignores everything he already took away from us.
How many women lost their voices because of the trauma he inflicted upon them? How many victims, like actress Annabella Sciorra, spent sleepless nights with baseball bats next to their beds? How many, like Rose McGowan and Rosanna Arquette, were actively blackballed by Weinstein, deprived of their craft and depriving us of their art? How many, like his former assistant Rowena Chiu, lived with her demons for so long and so silently that they tried to kill themselves? Or, like Bachman, how many victims simply lost time, wasted on trauma, sorrow, or flailing for faith?
And even the ones who got away paid a price. Shakespeare In Love's star Gwyneth Paltrow and Frida's Salma Hayek still faced sexual harassment from Weinstein, even if they seem unscathed on the surface.
When we talk about whether news networks should rehabilitate Matt Lauer or if publishers should sign Woody Allen, we need to ask the next question a thousand times over: How much did these monsters in power take away from the world, in time, in art, in dignity, or even in life?
So, we'll lose Weinstein's movies. I, for one, couldn't care less. Instead, I'll mourn for all that his predation silenced and destroyed.

Texto completo: Over the weekend Donald Trump once again declared that the coronavirus is perfectly under control, that any impressions to the contrary are due to the “Fake News Media” out to get him. Question: Does anyone have a count of how many times he’s done this, comparable to the running tallies fact checkers are keeping of his lies?
In any case, we’ve pretty clearly reached the point where Trump’s assurances that everything is fine actually worsen the panic, because they demonstrate the depths of his delusions. Even as he was tweeting out praise for himself, global markets were in free-fall.
Never mind cratering stock prices. The best indicator of collapsing confidence is what is happening to interest rates, which have plunged almost as far and as fast as they did during the 2008 financial crisis. Markets are implicitly predicting not just a recession, but multiple years of economic weakness.
And at first I was tempted to say that our current situation is even worse than it was in 2008, because at least then we had leadership that recognized the seriousness of the crisis rather than dismissing it all as a liberal conspiracy.
When you look back at the record, however, you discover that as the financial crisis developed, right-wingers were also deeply in denial, inclined to dismiss bad news or attribute it to liberal and/or media conspiracies. It was only in the final stages of financial collapse that top officials got real, and right-wing pundits never did.
Let’s take a trip down memory lane.
The 2008 financial crisis was brought on by the collapse of an immense housing bubble. But many on the right denied that there was anything amiss. Larry Kudlow, now Trump’s chief economist, ridiculed “bubbleheads” who suggested that housing prices were out of line.
And I can tell you from personal experience that when I began writing about the housing bubble, I was relentlessly accused of playing politics: “You only say there’s a bubble because you hate President Bush.”
When the economy began to slide, mainstream Republicans remained deeply in denial. Phil Gramm, John McCain’s senior economic adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign, declared that America was only suffering a “mental recession” and had become a “nation of whiners.”
Even the failure of Lehman Bros., which sent the economy into a full meltdown, initially didn’t put a dent in conservative denial. Kudlow hailed the failure as good news, because it signaled an end to bailouts, and predicted housing and financial recovery in “months, not years.”
Wait, there’s more. After the economic crisis helped Barack Obama win the 2008 election, right-wing pundits declared that it was all a left-wing conspiracy. Karl Rove and Bill O’Reilly accused the news media of hyping bad news to enable Obama’s socialist agenda, while Rush Limbaugh asserted that Sen. Chuck Schumer personally caused the crisis (don’t ask).
The point is that Trump’s luridly delusional response to the coronavirus and his conspiracy theorizing about Democrats and the news media aren’t really that different from the way the right dealt with the financial crisis a dozen years ago. True, last time the crazy talk wasn’t coming directly from the president of the United States. But that’s not the important distinction between then and now.
No, what’s different now is that denial and the resulting delay are likely to have deadly consequences.
It’s not clear, even in retrospect, how much better things would have been if right-wingers had recognized economic reality in 2008. Years of deregulation and lax enforcement had already weakened the financial system, and it was probably too late to head off the coming crisis.
Virus denial, by contrast, squandered crucial time — time that could have been used to slow the coronavirus’ spread. For the clear and present danger now isn’t so much that large numbers of Americans will get sick — that was probably going to happen anyway — but that the epidemic will move so fast that it overloads our hospitals.
By not instituting widespread testing from the start, the U.S. has ensured that there are now cases all over the country — we have no idea how many — and that the virus will spread rapidly. And even now there is no hint that the administration is ready for the kinds of public health measures that might limit the pace of that spread.
Oh, and when it comes to the economic response, it’s worth noting that basically everyone on the Trump economic team was totally wrong about the 2008 crisis. It seems to be a job requirement.
The bottom line is that like so much of what is happening in America right now, the coronavirus crisis isn’t just about Trump. His intellectual and emotional inadequacy, his combination of megalomania and insecurity, are certainly contributing to the problem; has there ever been a president so obviously not up to the job? But in refusing to face uncomfortable facts, in attributing all bad news to sinister conspiracies, he’s actually just being a normal man of his faction.
In 2020 we’re relearning the lessons of 2008 — namely, that America’s right-wingers can’t handle the truth.

Coronavirus is very different from the Spanish Flu of 1918. Here’s how.

Texto completo: It was a disease so awful that it terrified people for generations.
The 1918 flu pandemic, thought to be the deadliest in human history, killed at least 50 million people worldwide (the equivalent of 200 million today), with half a million of those in the United States. It spread to every part of the world, affecting populations in Japan, Argentina, Germany and dozens of other countries.
Maybe most alarmingly, a majority of those killed by the disease were in the prime of life — often in their 20s, 30s and 40s — rather than older people weakened by other medical conditions.
As the coronavirus spreads around the world and public anxieties spike, comparisons between today’s situation and the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 are proliferating in journalistic outlets and on social media.
[ Read more: Complete coverage of the coronavirus ]
While the fearful atmosphere — surgical masks, stockpiling of food and avoidance of public gatherings — and potential economic ramifications are like those of 1918, the medical reality is quite different.
“Nurses often walked into scenes resembling those of the plague years of the fourteenth century,” wrote historian Alfred W. Crosby in “America’s Forgotten Pandemic.” “One nurse found a husband dead in the same room where his wife lay with newly born twins. It had been twenty-four hours since the death and the births, and the wife had had no food but an apple which happened to lie within reach.”
In 1918, the world was a very different place, even without the disruptive influence of World War I. Doctors knew viruses existed but had never seen one — there were no electron microscopes, and the genetic material of viruses had not yet been discovered. Today, however, researchers not only know how to isolate a virus but can find its genetic sequence, test antiviral drugs and develop a vaccine.
In 1918, it was impossible to test people with mild symptoms so they could self-quarantine. And it was nearly impossible to do contact tracing because the flu seemed to infect — and panic — entire cities and communities all at once. Moreover, there was little protective equipment for health care workers, and the supportive care with respirators that can be provided to people very ill with coronavirus did not exist.
With a case fatality rate of at least 2.5%, the 1918 flu was far more deadly than ordinary flu, and it was so infectious that it spread widely, which meant the number of deaths soared.
Researchers believe the 1918 flu spared older people because they had some immunity to it. They theorize that decades earlier there had been a version of that virus, one that was not as lethal and spread like an ordinary flu. The older people living in 1918 would have been exposed to that less lethal flu and developed antibodies. As for children, most viral illnesses — measles, chickenpox — are more deadly in young adults, which may explain why the youngest were spared in the 1918 epidemic.
Regardless of the reason, it was a disaster for life expectancy, which plummeted. In 1917, life expectancy in the United States was 51 years. It was the same in 1919. But in 1918, it was just 39 years.
The new coronavirus tends to kill older people and those with underlying medical conditions, and it does not seem to kill children. All of which means it will have far less effect, if any, on life expectancy.
As for the coronavirus case fatality rate, it is not yet known, but the latest data from South Korea, with 7,478 confirmed infections, shows one in line with that of seasonal flu. After testing 100,000 people for the virus, the country appears to have a case fatality rate of 0.65%.
What the current situation does have in common with 1918, though, is the tenor of public concern.
Among the first places the 1918 flu arrived in the United States was Fort Devens, near Boston. So many young soldiers were sick, and so many were dying, that the surgeon general sent four of the nation’s leading doctors to investigate.
One of them, Dr. William Vaughan, later recalled: “Hundreds of stalwart young men in the uniform of their country, coming into the wards of the hospital in groups of 10 or more. They are placed on the cots until every bed is full, yet others crowd in. Their faces soon wear a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up the blood stained sputum. In the morning the dead bodies are stacked about the morgue like cord wood.”
Accounts like these scared Americans deeply.
On Oct. 3, 1918, Philadelphia closed all schools, churches, theaters, pool halls and other gathering places. Undertakers were overwhelmed — some funeral homes increased their prices sixfold and some even made the bereaved bury their own dead.
In Tucson, Arizona, the board of health forbade people to venture out in public without a mask. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, where schools and theaters were closed, a local newspaper wrote, “the ghost of fear walked everywhere.”
Similar actions are being taken today. Seattle has closed some public schools. The South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, has been canceled. Apple asked employees to work from home. More than 2,700 people are under some sort of quarantine in New York City. And some Costco stores are having trouble keeping bottled water in stock.
But so far this year, the annual epidemic of seasonal flu is proving much more devastating than the coronavirus in the United States.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there have been at least 34 million infected with flu this season, 350,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths. Those deaths include 136 children, nearly 10 times as many adult deaths from the coronavirus.
For the economy, the effects of the 1918 flu, despite factory closings and social disruptions, were hard to disentangle from the profound ones of World War I. The world was not as interconnected as it is today, and by the summer of 1919, the pandemic had ended.
Coronavirus is already having significant impacts on the stock market and other aspects of the economy, but the long-term consequences remain to be seen.

Texto completo: The current snow-sports season is far from over, but the companies running the popular multiresort passes would like you to start thinking about the next one. Passes from the three main players are now on sale for the 2020-21 season, with incentives to buy early: As time goes on, prices go up and some perks vanish. The renewal discount for the 2020-21 Ikon Pass and Ikon Base Pass, for example, ends April 22.
Here’s what you need to know about the updates to next year’s Epic, Ikon and Mountain Collective passes.
Epic
The big news for Epic, the Vail Resorts’ pass, is the introduction of Epic Mountain Rewards, which offers 20% off an array of services at the destinations owned and operated by the Colorado-based behemoth. “It’s really simple,” said Johnna M. Muscente, the director of communications at Vail Resorts. “You have access to Epic Mountain Rewards whether you ski one day or every day in the season. You don’t need to sign up for anything, you don’t need to track miles or points. And there are no blackout dates.”
Pass holders present their cards when renting skis or snowboards on site, or when buying quick-service lunch or dinner. They can also use the Rewards website to book lodging, group lessons or rentals ahead of time. There is some fine print: Alcohol isn’t included, for example, and the dining discount applies up to $150 in purchases per day.

Besides that, Epic is staying the course with its two main products. The first is the Epic Local Pass ($729 — for adults, as are all the prices quoted here), which offers unlimited access to 26 resorts as well as restricted access to flagship mountains like Park City, Utah; Vail, Colorado; and Whistler Blackcomb, British Columbia. The second is the Epic Pass ($979), which has fewer restrictions and includes more international destinations.
Epic is strengthening its New England base with two new regional passes: a Northeast Midweek ($449) and a Northeast Value ($599). There are local offerings, too, like the $389 Keystone Plus Pass in Colorado, which gives unlimited (excluding holiday blackouts) access to Keystone, as well as unlimited access to neighboring Breckenridge after April 1, and five days (with blackouts) at Crested Butte.
Ikon
In the winter of 2019, the Ikon pass became a target of criticism for locals irked by increased traffic on the roads and lifts. The agitation flared up especially at Colorado’s Aspen Snowmass and Wyoming’s Jackson Hole, which may explain why, for 2020-21, access to these two destinations will be a $150 add-on to the $699 Ikon Base Pass, unlocking five days at each place. (Both resorts remain part of the package for the $999 Ikon Pass.)
“We need to manage the experience we provide, and we feel the new arrangement will help us do that,” said Jeff Hanle, the vice president for communications at the Aspen Skiing Co. He also pointed out that a freak abundance of sunny powder weekends during the 2018-19 season had contributed to the overall number of visits.
“Being an add-on will make people commit, so those who really want to ski Jackson Hole will make that decision when they’re purchasing,” said Anna Cole, the communications director at Jackson Hole.
[ Read more: A Washington ski resort ended single-day tickets on weekends. Could Utah resorts be next? ]
Also new is the $399 Ikon Session Pass 4-Day, which offers four flexible days at 30 participating resorts (though not at Copper Mountain, Colorado, or Killington, Vermont, for example).
The last major Ikon change is increased access at Vermont’s Sugarbush and Stratton resorts — good news for New Englanders.
Mountain Collective
Next season, Mountain Collective is adding four destinations: Sugarloaf, Maine; Panorama, British Columbia; Grand Targhee, Wyoming; and Chamonix, France (promoted from affiliate to full member). A favorite of ski devotees, Grand Targhee had long been a pass holdout, and its proximity to Jackson Hole — which is also in the collective — will make the region doubly attractive for pass holders.
“The Mountain Collective Pass fills a niche for adventurers and snow chasers who don’t necessarily live close to a resort but want affordable access to the best winter destinations on the planet,” said Christian Knapp, the chief marketing officer of Aspen Skiing Co. “The relatively low out-of-pocket price, combined with the flexibility of extension days and no blackouts, sets it apart from other multiresort passes.”
At $469 for 2020-21, the Mountain Collective Pass offers two free days at each of its 22 destinations and 50% off the window rate for additional days. The price tends to go up in the late spring and early summer, when incentives — such as a third free day at one destination and a $99 pass for children 12 and under — disappear.

Thomas L. Friedman: Biden, not Sanders, is the true Scandinavian

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders often cites Denmark as the kind of country he would like America to be under his ideology of “democratic socialism.” Well, here’s a news flash: Bernie Sanders, with his hostile attitudes toward free trade, free markets and multinational corporations, probably couldn’t get elected to a municipal council in Denmark today. Ironically, Joe Biden, with his more balanced views on trade, corporations and unions, probably could. And therein lies a column.
I can explain this best by starting with a few questions that I’d love to ask Sanders about his democratic socialism, beginning with the most basic one: Sen. Sanders, where do you think jobs come from?
They come from risk-takers who borrow money from banks or relatives or max out their credit cards or spend their own savings to start companies they hope will become profitable. If that is what Sanders believes, you’d never know it from listening to him.
To listen to him (and his surrogates) is to listen to someone who seems to believe that the American economic pie just miraculously appeared and exists on its own. He never discusses where that pie came from, how to bake it or how to enlarge it. His only interest is how to redivide it.
Second: Sen. Sanders, is there a single American entrepreneur or corporate leader whom you admire? Or is each and every one of them part of the “corporate greed and corruption” responsible for “destroying the social and economic fabric of our society,” as you put it on your website. When was the last time you even visited a big U.S. multinational and sat down with its employees and executives?
Third, Sen. Sanders, do you believe the free enterprise system is the best means for growing jobs, the economy and opportunity — or do you believe in more socialist central planning? I ask because I have often heard you praise Scandinavian countries, like Denmark, as exemplars of democratic socialism. Have you ever been to Denmark? It’s democratic but not socialist.
Denmark is actually a hypercompetitive, wide-open, market economy devoted to free trade and expanding globalization, since trade — exports and imports — makes up roughly half of Denmark’s GDP.
Indeed, Denmark’s 5.8 million people have produced some of the most globally competitive multinationals in the world, by the names of AP Moller-Maersk, Danske Bank, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg Group, Vestas, Coloplast, the Lego Group and Novozymes. These are the very giant multinationals Sanders constantly rails against.
As the former Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen once remarked in a speech at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government to those who might not fully grasp the Danish model: “I would like to make one thing clear, Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy. The Nordic model is an expanded welfare state, which provides a high level of security for its citizens, but it is also a successful market economy with much freedom to pursue your dreams and live your life as you wish.”
It is through these engines of capitalism, free trade, economic openness and globalization that Denmark has managed to become wealthy enough to afford the social safety net that Sanders rightly admires — as do I: access for all to child care, medical and parental leave from work, tuition-free college, a living stipend, universal health care and generous pensions.
But there is nothing free about these services. According to Investopedia, Denmark’s progressive income tax tops out at 55.8%, and the average individual pays 45%. The Danes pay an 8% labor market tax, a 5% health care tax, as well as hefty municipal taxes and a social security tax. Denmark also has the highest national sales tax in the European Union — 25% — on most goods and services, a big tax on the middle class.
In short, Sanders cherry-picks Denmark. He stresses what he loves — all that the Danish state provides — and then he ignores two things: one obvious and important and one less obvious and even more important.
The obvious and important one is the relentlessly entrepreneurial capitalism that generates Denmark’s prosperity and that is celebrated there. The less obvious, but more important, feature of Denmark’s success is the high-trust social compact among its business community, labor unions, social entrepreneurs and government. That’s the real secret of Denmark’s sauce.
I know a little something about this because in March 2018 Rasmussen, who was then still the prime minister, invited me to give a talk about globalization to a retreat at Marienborg, his official residence, as part of a meeting of the Danish “Disruption Council.” It brought together all the country’s stakeholders — corporate leaders, national union leaders, educators, social entrepreneurs and Cabinet ministers — to brainstorm about how they should work together to prepare the country for the rest of the century.
It was fascinating for me to watch them respectfully interact. Obviously, in a small, largely homogeneous country of 5.8 million people, it is a lot easier to generate that kind of social trust than in a diverse nation of 327 million. But the point is, no one was demonizing others as “corrupt” by the very fact of who they were — whether labor organizer or corporate titan or someone of wealth.
They understood that it was the balancing of all their interests that made Denmark’s economic growth and generous social safety net possible.
In nature, ecosystems thrive the most when they are “in balance.” Mother Nature achieves that balance in her own ways, some quite brutal. Political systems also thrive when they are in balance. Denmark has found a healthy balance of the interests of capital, labor, social entrepreneurs and government. The thriving and adapting by each reinforces the other.
America is now out of balance. We all sense it in the gross and widening inequality we see around us. Sanders sincerely wants to eliminate that. Alas, so do a lot of us. Michael Bloomberg was running on a platform advocating a 5% surtax on incomes of over $5 million annually.
But when you begin that conversation, as Sanders does, by effectively demonizing all risk-taking American entrepreneurs as corrupt, by vowing to redistribute their income — which Sanders seems to believe is all ill gotten by definition — by pretending that all the benefits can be paid for by the wealthy and nothing from the middle class and by voting against the new version of NAFTA — which was supported by the AFL-CIO and Nancy Pelosi as precisely the kind of trade deal with the very union and environmental protections Democrats have long sought — then your true model country is not Denmark. It’s a socialist fantasy.
The truth is, Joe Biden would make a much better Scandinavian-type leader than Bernie Sanders.
Biden, in my view, would be much more likely to — and able to — build a new social contract in America than a President Sanders, because Biden not only genuinely cares about the working class and the homeless — and understands the need for access to lifelong education and health care — he also knows that you don’t get there by demonizing the engines of capitalism and job creation. You have to find a way to work with them.
Denmark did not become Denmark because of a revolution. It evolved where it is today through a steady iteration — unleashing its entrepreneurs on the world to generate as much wealth as they could while constantly forging a dialogue at home among all the stakeholders about how best to share enough of the profits to have a truly just safety net, while not destroying the free-market, free-trade engines of growth, and while maintaining a high sales tax so everyone contributes something.
If Denmark’s social contract is your model — and it’s a good one — then I’d trust Biden much more than Bernie to head us there.

Texto completo: Washington • House leaders Tuesday struck a bipartisan deal to overhaul surveillance laws just days before a trio of FBI investigative tools expires, raising the possibility of a last-minute breakthrough in a politically complex debate over civil liberties and national security.
The changes would install new privacy protections — including adding a skeptical voice to secret court deliberations when the FBI wants to eavesdrop on Americans under certain circumstances — but stop short of more sweeping limits favored by some civil libertarians in both parties that are viewed skeptically by national security officials and centrist lawmakers.
If it becomes law, the bill would represent Congress’ response to a damning inspector general report that uncovered numerous errors and omissions by the FBI in applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, during the early stages of the Russia investigation.
But even if the House passes the legislation, the bill could face obstacles in moving quickly through the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to overcome any filibuster. It would also need to be signed by President Donald Trump, who has been unpredictable on surveillance policy issues while displaying a hazy understanding of their details.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Republican leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, abruptly unveiled the bill, the “USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020,” after days of intense negotiations. They set a vote for Wednesday.
Much of the revised bill — co-sponsored by Reps. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairmen of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees — is similar to the legislation that the Judiciary Committee had been set to mark up two weeks ago, before a rebellion by liberal lawmakers seeking more drastic changes derailed it. But it contains some tweaks, including enhanced criminal penalties for abusing surveillance powers.
In a rare collaboration, Nadler and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a strident ally of Trump who is becoming the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, sat next to each other in the Rules Committee on Tuesday to jointly press for its passage.
“This bill does not go far enough, but it does represent real reform,” Jordan said. “These reforms have long been necessary but have been especially warranted in recent years given the FBI’s spying on the Trump campaign affiliate Carter Page and the affront to First Amendment rights that this represented.”
Congress has been debating whether and how it should tighten FISA limits while it extends three FBI surveillance and investigative tools enacted after the Sept. 11 attacks that are set to expire Sunday. While none of those tools were involved in the problematic Page wiretap applications, they have been caught up in the debate because both traditionally civil liberties-minded lawmakers and many Trump allies see any extension legislation as a vehicle for broader FISA changes.
Surveillance talks have been topsy-turvy in recent weeks. House Democrats at one point pushed a bill that would have extended the expiring collection tools and instituted more modest changes, but it collapsed when a senior Democratic congresswoman said she would offer amendments imposing significantly more stringent privacy protections to targets of counterterrorism and espionage investigations.
Senate Republican leaders, including Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had their own intentions — a straightforward reauthorization of the existing powers through at least the end of the year that Attorney General William Barr supported. But Trump undercut them by insisting he would not sign any measure that left the system largely intact.
The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard M. Burr, R-N.C., had been skeptical of more aggressive proposals for FISA changes but said Tuesday that if Barr endorsed the legislation, he would try to move it quickly.
“If he signed off on it, it would probably be something that we would be comfortable with,” Burr told reporters.
Barr, who led talks with lawmakers on behalf of the administration, backs the bill, according to a Justice Department official. Barr had told Republicans that he himself could impose new oversight rules on the FBI’s FISA process should lawmakers reauthorize the expiring provisions without including any.
[ Read more: Utah spent $250K on a surveillance company instead of a lifesaving overdose drug ]
Lawmakers from both parties objected to his proposal, though senior Justice Department officials said the bill left open the possibility that Barr could eventually impose additional limits on the FBI’s national security surveillance.
Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, said its leaders would try to push through the House agreement as well before they left town later this week for a weeklong recess.
But they are likely to face opposition from at least two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, who believe the changes fall short of protecting civil liberties and could drag out the approval process for days.
Paul denounced the bill on Twitter as “weak sauce” and a “big disappointment.”
Thune acknowledged the potential roadblocks, and senators might consider a short-term extension of the expiring authorities if they cannot pass the House measure this week.
The bill would extend the three expiring tools — like the FBI’s ability to get FISA court orders for business records deemed relevant to a national security investigation — while ending legal authority for an expensive, dysfunctional and defunct NSA system that had allowed counterterrorism analysts to swiftly access logs of Americans’ phone calls.
The bill would also expand when FISA judges — who normally hear only from the government when deciding whether to grant a surveillance application — should appoint an outsider to critique the government’s position. Currently, judges are supposed to do so only when addressing a novel and significant question of interpreting surveillance law.
Under the bill, the FISA court would also be directed to consider appointing a government critic when an application “presents exceptional concerns” about protecting the First Amendment rights of a surveillance subject — a formulation that could apply to investigations touching on political campaigns or religious activity.
Some House lawmakers have wanted to go further, requiring an outside critique every time an American is the target of national security surveillance, no matter how routine. Because there are hundreds of such cases a year, that change would have far greater operational consequences for investigators.
The Justice Department had objected to the broader proposal, senior officials said, over concerns that it would jeopardize national security.
The bill would not make a change that many civil liberties and privacy groups have advocated: letting defense lawyers read FISA applications if their clients are prosecuted on the basis of evidence derived from such wiretaps or searches, as defense lawyers are permitted to do in ordinary criminal cases.
But it would also expand criminal penalties issues surrounding misuse of FISA, raising from five to eight years the prison sentence for engaging in electronic surveillance without following procedures.
The bill would also outlaw the disclosure of the existence of an application or classified information contained in it, as well as knowingly making a false declaration before the FISA court. The move would be more symbolic than substantive because those were already illegal.
And it would make clear that the government cannot use a business records order to collect information — like cellphone location data — that in a criminal investigation requires a search warrant, which has a higher legal standard.
The FBI has already overhauled its FISA procedures to ensure that all mitigating evidence that undercuts the bureau’s belief that a surveillance target is probably an agent of a foreign power reaches the FISA court. The court has banned, at least temporarily, agents who worked on the Page applications from appearing before its judges.
But the unanswered question is how Trump will respond to the bill, which is likely to be seen as bringing to a close any congressional overhaul in response to the problems with the Page wiretaps. Trump continues to nurture a conspiracy theory that the Russian election interference investigation was a high-level scheme by the FBI to undercut him for political purposes and that the monitoring of Page — which began after Page had left the campaign and was renewed three times in 2017 — was a piece of that purported plot.

Texto completo: Like most Americans who don’t live in the handful of swing states that decide close presidential elections, I’ve watched the pandering, politicking and passion directed at those lucky voters and wondered, what about us? I’m part of the vast electoral desert.
The primaries have been even worse, as we in the clamorous majority have had to stand by idly as a pair of small, overwhelmingly white states chose the party nominees. Oh, for a negative ad, a robocall, an earnest door-beller.
But all of that changed when Washington state moved its presidential nominating contest up to March 10 — so-called Mini Tuesday, when voters in six states get to weigh in. Washington, with 89 delegates at stake, has the second-largest haul, behind Michigan.
But my vote won’t count. It’s not because a nursing home in the Seattle area is at the center of the deadly sweep of coronavirus in the United States. Because there is no in-person voting except for a few special exceptions, the virus outbreak may not affect turnout, though election officials have urged people to refrain from licking their mail-in envelopes. The candidates are staying away, and rightfully so. Social distancing, in a public health crisis, is not the same as shunning.
No, the problem is early voting. I cast my ballot by mail last month. I was one of more than 600,000 people in Washington who voted even before the South Carolina primary. Voting at leisure, by mail, is the simplest, easiest way to have your say. You don’t even need a stamp.
But I voted for one of the candidates who have since dropped out. That means I will have zero influence on the outcome. If we had ranked choice — in which you could pick a second candidate in case your chosen one failed to make the top tier — it would count. But that’s another argument.
Since I mailed in my ballot, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg have dropped out. I should mention that I wrote a column just before Super Tuesday urging all of them to do just that. But what politician ever takes advice from a writer?
My experience is shared by millions of people, especially in California, who voted before the landscape shifted sharply. In essence, we are disenfranchised by our early diligence to democratic duty.
Bernie Sanders is now running some pretty annoying negative ads against Joe Biden in my home state. And his robo-bros have been texting relentlessly. I’d love to have a say.
A friend of mine says you should always wait until the very last minute to vote because, as he quoted the mother of Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor, “Between now and then, a pope will be born.”
I never understood what that meant. I do now. And I will never vote before Election Day again.

A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY A LOT OF HIGH-MINDED PEOPLE ARE ALL TOO WILLING TO COMPROMISE THEIR SUPPOSED PRINCIPLES

Texto completo: As we approach the Pennsylvania primary, the Democratic Party is having an identity crisis.
It dates back to 2016, when Bernie Sanders nearly dethroned Hillary Clinton for the party's presidential nomination.
Now, the same division is resurfacing again as the Democratic establishment rallies around another party insider who vows to maintain the established order.
As former Vice President Joe Biden told a room of Wall Street donors back in June, "nothing would fundamentally change" if he's elected. "No one's standard of living will change."
That might be good news for Wall Street and the 66 billionaire donors contributing to Mr. Biden's campaign, but it's not good news for the 78% of American workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, or the 61 million American households who can't afford basics like food and rent. Presumably they could use a change in their standard of living.
But that's not Mr. Biden's fight. He's battling for the sake of business as usual.
By contrast, Mr. Sanders is fighting to make sure every American has economic security, and he's doing it by taking on the corporate interests that control our economy and political system.
This presents the Democratic Party with a clear choice: Is it going to be the party of the rich or the party of the working class?
For years, the Democratic Party has pretended to be the party of the working class, while actually functioning as the party of the rich. When it comes to key economic issues - trade, health care, housing, education, Social Security, minimum wage, workers' rights - Democratic insiders like Mr. Biden have proved just as likely to cozy up to the rich and powerful as Republicans.
It's no wonder, then, that Mr. Biden is the preferred establishment candidate.
Much like President Donald Trump, Mr. Biden has branded himself a "blue-collar" guy. But also like Mr. Trump - who's been more effective giving billionaires tax breaks than creating living-wage jobs - Mr. Biden has repeatedly sold out the working class.
As a U.S. senator, Mr. Biden called for cuts to Medicare and Social Security, voted for the Iraq War, supported NAFTA and other "free" trade deals, prioritized corporate rights over consumer rights, passed bankruptcy bills that made it harder for Americans to reduce their debts, supported crime bills that ramped up mass incarceration - all while collecting millions in financial contributions from Wall Street and union-busting law firms.
Of course, mainstream Democrats don't want to talk about this. They prefer to promote Mr. Biden as someone other than he is - somebody who's merely "electable."
But that tells you all you need to know about the Democratic establishment: Their role is diminishing expectations.
And their message is woefully shortsighted: We can make everything better by simply getting rid of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Sanders has a different message: The system is corrupt. Billionaires are taking everything. Health care is a human right. Climate change requires strong action. Everyone should make a living wage. Nothing will change unless working people come together and fight this unjust system. Power belongs with them.
It's a message that resonates with voters, and it's one reason why Mr. Sanders consistently beats Mr. Trump in the polls, even when he's called a "socialist."
It's also why Mr. Trump himself was afraid that Ms. Clinton would pick Mr. Sanders as her running mate back in 2016. As he told his inner circle at a private dinner in 2018, "[Sanders] is the only one I didn't want her to pick."
What's telling about the Democratic Party is that it doesn't want to pick Mr. Sanders either. Party leaders tell us that he's too "radical," his politics too "divisive." They prefer Mr. Sanders to play nice and relax his core principles for the sake of party "unity."
But here's the thing: If you actually have principles, nothing should push you to change them.
That's what politics is about; it's about fighting for your principles. And that process is inherently divisive. You have to pick a side.
You're either against inequality, or you find ways to justify it.
You either fight to change the established order, or you find your place in it.
You either commit to the "radical" belief that human beings should have health care, housing and a livable planet, or you find ways to compromise.
What this election has made abundantly clear is that a lot of high-minded people who profess to have principles are all too willing to compromise them. And a lot of these people belong to the Democratic Party.

Texto completo: CASPER – The University of Wyoming has canceled summer study abroad trips to China and South Korea in light of coronavirus outbreaks in those two countries as part of a wave of preparations undertaken by the university.
In messages sent to campus Friday, the university wrote that the school “needs to be prepared should some students, staff and faculty on our campus be ill or under quarantine in the coming weeks and months.”
No case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has been confirmed in Wyoming. There have been 423 confirmed cases across 35 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Neighboring states Colorado and Utah have both had cases, as has Nebraska; a hospital there has also treated patients who contracted the illness elsewhere.
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can cause symptoms that range from minor to severe. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and cough. According to the CDC, symptoms may appear up to two weeks after contact with an infected person. The federal agency urges anyone with symptoms who may have come into contact with a COVID-19 patient to call their health care provider immediately. Generally, people should wash their hands frequently and well and should avoid contact with sick people.
UW wrote to staff that university-related travel to several countries “requires express pre-approval from the university president.” Any staff or students returning from China, South Korea, Italy or Iran – four countries with the most severe outbreaks – must “self-isolate for 14 days.” Similarly, any person who’s been in contact with someone with COVID-19 or who has similar symptoms should also self-isolate.
The university also instructed all instructors to prepare for their classes to continue running should a teacher become sick or need to be quarantined. Gradebooks must be kept updated and processes to turn in final papers must be prepared. Attendance policies may be loosened as students call in sick.
In a separate message to staff sent early last week, university leadership said it was preparing “detailed pre-travel safety considerations” for students about to leave for spring break, “identification of residence hall quarantine areas to use if needed” and a review of university events.
Chad Baldwin, the university’s spokesman, said the school was preparing in case it had to move all coursework online.
Baldwin said the university feels it has the infrastructure to handle the case, citing its close relationship with Ivinson Memorial Hospital in Laramie.
COVID-19 has spread rapidly in recent days, with Italy restricting movement throughout the country and Saudi Arabia cutting off air and sea travel to several other countries. In the U.S., four states have declared emergencies, and the stock market cratered.
According to The New York Times, the number of cases in the U.S. rose by roughly 50 percent over the weekend.
The University of Washington moved its classes online, as have Seattle University and Northeastern University, according to the Times. Stanford University announced late last week that it wouldn’t hold in-person classes for the indefinite future. A Vanderbilt University student tested positive after a study abroad trip to Italy.
According to a Monday press release, the state Health Department is urging people to remain vigilant and to take care of themselves.
“We believe it’s likely the disease will spread to this state at some point, but do not yet know how widespread the illness will be over time after it does arrive,” said Dr. Alexia Harrist, the state’s health officer. “In Wyoming, travelers to certain locations with high numbers of reported cases and close contacts of ill people are at the highest risk.”
“One thing we are NOT recommending is the use of facemasks as a general preventive measure,” Harrist wrote. The press release states that the CDC does not recommend healthy people wear facemasks.
“Facemasks should be used by people who are ill to help prevent spread. Facemasks are also important for health workers and others taking care of infected people,” the department said.

Texto completo: The death penalty, whether to elect or appoint the attorney general, and DUI penalties are all topics that might be discussed during the interim period by the Joint Judiciary Interim Committee.
CHEYENNE – Driving under the influence and distracted driving penalties, electing the attorney general and the death penalty are all topics that might be considered by the Joint Judiciary Interim Committee this summer.
The Senate Judiciary Committee and the Joint Judiciary Interim Committee met Tuesday afternoon to discuss proposed topics to potentially take up during the interim period.
Committee members were given a list of 28 proposed topics, and must rank them on a 1-6 scale to determine which topics will be discussed and researched further. The topics will be finalized at a later date, as co-chairs Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, and Rep. Dan Kirkbride, R-Chugwater, meet to determine what potential topics can be consolidated together.
The topics that aren’t up for a vote and will be a part of the interim discussions are judicial updates, public records and meeting laws. The committee will discuss public records and meetings as part of the two-year study on the topic.
The committee also will discuss judicial updates concerning how many judges are determined to be needed in districts and other judicial update issues such as the IT infrastructure of the court system.
“I think it is fundamentally important, not for us to decide if Campbell County needs another judge or Uinta County needs another judge, (but) what that processes is,” Nethercott said. “(It’s) for us to provide that process, instead of what has historically been the case of a powerful legislator, is what the testimony was, being able to pull off getting another judge in their district. That, to me, is not the right balance between the branches, and I do think legislative guidance concerning how and when positions of judges should be decided in a judicial district.”
Judges may not be allocated throughout the state in a way that’s best to meet the needs of constituents, she said, and reevaluating judge placement and needs are important.
Other topics up for discussion are the death penalty, methods of execution, DUI and distracted driving penalties, sexual assault statutes, the election of an attorney general and more.
Kirkbride said at its meeting yesterday the House Judiciary Committee decided its top three topics for discussion are DUI and distracted driving penalties, electing the attorney general and the death penalty.
Rep. Art Washut, R-Casper, said that he would like to take a look at the DUI penalties in part because of the consuming nature of charging someone with a DUI. Referencing testimony from yesterday’s committee meeting, he said some officers in rural areas are hit hard because of state statute.
In areas that have only one officer on duty, he said, the remainder of the officer’s shift may be compromised because they are then consumed with the DUI charge for the rest of their shift.
Washut also said he would like to take another look at the death penalty, even though it could be time consuming. He said he would like to look at the appropriations spent on the death penalty over the years, and the appellate court decisions that have turned over death penalty cases.
Other representatives who also voiced interest in taking another look at the death penalty included Rep. Sarah Burlingame, D-Cheyenne; Rep. Bill Pownall, R-Gillette; Rep. Chuck Gray, R-Casper, and more.
“Candidly, I have no desire to do the interim on the death penalty,” Nethercott said. “(And) hear the same testimony we’ve heard in the Legislature that went on for years ... we’ll spend a great deal of our interim hearing stories about the death penalty, and I’m not sure if that’s the best use of our time as opposed to deciding whether or not we want to create a method of execution.”
The other issue lawmakers brought up for discussion and seemed to have a large amount of support for is whether to make the Wyoming attorney general’s position elected instead of appointed.
Currently, the attorney general is appointed by the governor. In other states, this position can be elected instead of appointed.
Gray said he’s passionate about the election of the attorney general and studying the attorney general’s office. He said he sees a problem here because it took the attorney general three years to proceed against the state of Washington and the attorney general declined to be a party in the U.S. Supreme Court case against Obamacare, he said.
Wyoming recently joined Montana in suing Washington over the state’s denial of a proposed coal export terminal permit, according to previous Wyoming Tribune Eagle reporting. The conflict centers on Washington’s permit denials for the Millennium Bulk Terminal, which would sit on the Columbia River in Longview, Washington. In their case, Wyoming and Montana argue the denial violates both the Dormant Commerce Clause and the Foreign Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.
Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments over the funding mechanism of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. This is the third challenge the act has faced in the Supreme Court and arguments haven’t been scheduled at this time, according to the New York Times.
Rep. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, and other lawmakers also listed the election of an attorney general as a priority for them in the interim.

Stephens: Things I won’t have to worry about if Biden wins

Texto completo: If Joe Biden wins the Democratic nomination, I’ll worry that his candidacy might be doomed. Doomed by Sanders supporters who, out of pique, will sit out the election; doomed by a throwback messenger with no particularly stirring message; doomed by hints of infirmity that many voters find worrisome and that Donald Trump will exploit with crass efficiency.
If, despite this, Biden wins the presidency, I’ll worry that, as a potential one-termer, he’ll bend too far to appease his party’s progressive wing. That he’ll do so in order to cut a figure for history. That he’ll over-empower federal agencies, overregulate business and overtax individuals. That he’ll appoint judges with cramped views of religious liberty and free speech. That he’ll resume a policy of appeasement toward Iran.
Then again, if Biden wins, there will be other things that, for a change, I won’t have to worry about. And most of these will be the things that really matter.
If Biden wins only the nomination, I won’t have to worry that there’s a fair chance that, in Bernie Sanders, a man could be elected president who, without nuance or discrimination, demonizes entire sectors of American industry. I won’t have to worry about getting my health insurance taken from me or watch my savings shrink to nothing thanks to monetary policy on the Weimar Republic model. I won’t have to worry that the self-described “dirtbag left” will become to the Democratic Party what the Hannity-Carlson-Ingraham right is to the Republican Party.
I won’t have to worry that not one, but both, major U.S. parties have become unrecognizable from what they were just five years ago; that they’ve succumbed to their respective extremes; that nowhere in American politics do centrists have sway; and that on nothing is compromise possible.
And if Biden wins the White House?
In that case, I won’t have to worry about the president trying to criminalize his political opponent. Not with demagogic chants of “Lock her up,” nor with quiet attempts to strong-arm an ally for the sake of digging up dirt on an American citizen. I won’t have to worry about White House officials being forced to choose between their ethical obligations and their loyalty to the president. I won’t have to worry about an attorney general who chooses loyalty over obligation — and, a year later, is bluntly reprimanded by a Republican-appointed federal judge for doing so.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to fear that the president might order the abrogation of a free-trade agreement with a major trading partner — only for a watchful adviser to snatch the order from his desk before he can sign it. I won’t have to read about frantic aides wondering if the president is really serious about his threats to withdraw the U.S. from NATO. I won’t have to cross my fingers hoping that a clever general will convince the president that the reason we shouldn’t betray our desperate Kurdish allies in Syria is so we can keep the oil.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to watch another press conference like Trump’s in Helsinki. I won’t have to wonder why the president seized his own translator’s notes after a meeting with Vladimir Putin. I won’t have to hear paeans of praise sung for North Korea’s ogreish tyrant, or for Turkey’s pernicious strongman, or for China’s cult-of-personality despot.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to read that the president has told fellow American lawmakers to “go back” to their countries of birth or ancestry. I won’t have to watch the U.S. close its doors to desperate refugees on the view that they hail from “s---hole countries.” I won’t have to cringe in shame and disgust as the attorney general cites the Apostle Paul to defend a vile policy of separating children from parents as a useful deterrent against illegal immigration.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to listen to the president call members of my profession the “enemy of the American people.” Or people of my political viewpoint “human scum.” Or colleagues “stone cold losers.” I won’t have to spend time wondering whether being an unindicted co-conspirator in a hush-money scandal rises to the level of an impeachable offense. I won’t have to steer family conversations away from politics lest they veer into X-rated territory. If Biden wins, the word “Stormy” will refer only to weather, and “Daniels” only to whiskey.
If Biden wins, I will write column after column opposing him on policy grounds. But at least I’ll feel relief that the American people didn’t vindicate Trumpism and the nativism and meanness it represents.
If Biden wins, he will amuse, embarrass and probably alarm me with his gaffes, misstatements and memory lapses. But I’ll never feel ashamed to think of him as my president, much less to root for his success.
If Biden wins, it will not mean a great American presidency. It will mean a decent one. That will be more than enough for me.

Democrats bet on 'Sleepy Joe'

Texto completo: Be careful what you wish for.
It's “Sleepy Joe" and the Democrats vs. “deranged" Donald and the Deplorables.
For those paying attention to life beyond the creep of the coronavirus, here's the big news out of Tuesday night's primaries: Former vice president Joe Biden has effectively won the Democratic nomination, setting the stage for what he calls a “comeback for the soul of the nation."
And with that comes the risk of betting the nation still has a soul — and that Biden can win the battle to restore it. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is still in the race, but after Tuesday's losses, the pressure to drop out is growing.
President Trump and his allies have eagerly outlined a two-pronged line of attack against their expected foe: Biden is senile, and his son Hunter Biden made millions from international business connections while his father was vice president. Given the open question of Trump's mental fitness and the financial windfall enjoyed by Trump's children via their father's ascension to the White House, any such assault on Biden should be easy to blunt — right?
If only the “what about" defense worked that way for Democrats. It didn't in the 2016 presidential race, and it won't in 2020, either.
Sure, it would be great if former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg put his money behind a “scorched earth" attack on Trump's family members, as an aide to Bloomberg's now defunct presidential campaign suggested he would.
But in the end, it's going to be up to Biden to show he has the mental toughness and discipline to take the fight to Trump.
Sanders could do it, no matter what you think of Medicare for All and democratic socialism. So could Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, or former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. They all proved it against each other on the debate stage. Senator Kamala Harris of California had her moment too — famously against Biden, when she challenged his record on school busing to promote racial equity.
Obviously, a great debate performance does not guarantee victory. After all, Biden has yet to give one, and he's essentially the last candidate standing. That's because Democratic primary voters bought into the elusive concept of electability and decided Biden had it.
Now, he must prove it. Biden can't cut back on campaigning to play it safe while Trump is out there every day — coronavirus or no coronavirus. The 77-year-old Biden is going to have to mix it up and engage, to make it clear he's not too old — or too odd.
Directing an expletive toward a disgruntled factory worker who challenged him on gun control is OK up to a point. After all, jittery Democrats can remind themselves that Trump used the same expletive to describe Haiti and several countries in Africa. But again, relying on “whataboutism" to defeat Trump is a risky campaign strategy.
If Biden represents competence, honor, and decency, he will have to show it in the present tense, with words and actions. He can't make the case solely on the basis of his past service as Barack Obama's vice president.
Of course, if he successfully makes that case, the next question is whether enough American voters, living in states that can deliver electoral victory to the Democratic nominee, really seek the competence, honor, and decency Biden claims to represent.
Is the daily, explosive disruption of the Trump presidency too fatiguing to endure — or still too intriguing to reject?
Democrats are betting on a longing for the old normal — and on Biden to get them there. They are putting his meandering mind and rhetoric up against Trump's. They are putting what they consider his harmless gaffes up against Trump's meanness; his definition of character, up against Trump's utter lack of it.
Go ahead, admit it. Even in a world threatened by the coronavirus, betting on Biden is a little bit scary.

Coronavirus is coming for Trump's presidency

Texto completo: On Jan. 31, over a month ago, the Trump administration made an excellent decision: In an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus, it forbade most foreign nationals from entering the United States if they had recently traveled to China.
This move was immediately attacked in the language of cosmopolitan sophistication, which assumes that because travel bans and quarantines are associated with things liberals consider bad - nationalism, hardened borders, migration restrictions - they necessarily must not work as well.
But this supposed sophistication is really just a superstition. It's certainly true that the travel ban could not, and did not, prevent the coronavirus from reaching the United States. But as with local quarantines and closings - all of which emphatically do work, whether you're looking at the history of the Spanish flu or Hong Kong's success combating the coronavirus today - you don't need 100% effectiveness for travel restrictions to be wise and helpful. What they buy you, above all, is a slower rate of spread, and with it precious time for preparation.
So Trump made the right call, and in so doing he briefly vindicated a case that his supporters have always made for him: He acted like the guy who would make common-sensical choices in the national interest, even when they went against the nostrums of globalization and the supposed wisdom of the do-gooders.
And then his administration took the month that his decision bought the country and completely wasted it.
Obviously the White House isn't to blame for everything that's gone wrong with the coronavirus response. Our inability to roll out testing rapidly, even when thousands of cases are probably in circulation, owes a lot to the inherent problems of medical bureaucracy and the regulatory state and to the decadence that afflicts U.S. institutions at almost every level.
But the president can still be reasonably held responsible for the urgency with which the bureaucracy attacks the problem, the speed at which rules get suspended and workarounds enacted, the pressure brought to bear on state and local authorities to take a possible pandemic seriously, and the use of presidential rhetoric to encourage private citizens to do the same.
And on all counts the White House has been failing. There should have been a public face of the anti-coronavirus effort long before Mike Pence was finally elevated with the power to respond quickly to bureaucratic bottlenecks. Weeks ago, private laboratories like Quest Diagnostics should have been encouraged to run their own tests for the virus. Weeks ago, the government should have promised to cover the cost of testing, instead of leaving it to the tangle of insurance. Weeks ago, the White House should have begun working with states and cities to devise a uniform response to outbreaks and with Congress to ready aid packages for regions that need to go into lockdown - and perhaps to prepare a general stimulus as well. Even a specific issue like the production of surgical masks, outsourced like so many things to China, could have been the focus of a Trump-directed mobilization.
Above all, the president's rhetoric could have been deployed from early February onward to encourage people to take this disease seriously, to focus a political and social response, to prepare the country for the kind of steps that have contained the coronavirus elsewhere.
Instead, Trump fell into the same trap as the cosmopolitan sophisticates - acting as if the specter of panic is worse than the disease itself, focusing on the more reassuring estimates of the virus's fatality rates instead of recognizing the wide spread of possible scenarios - while mixing in his own short-termist fixation on the stock market. And then when, at last, even the cosmopolitans became alarmed, he took their anxiety as a partisan insult and lapsed into "hoax" accusations, pulling a certain percentage of his co-partisans into irresponsibility along with him.
Now the time his travel ban bought us has expired, and the next few weeks will be decisive. There is still a chance that state and local efforts to contain the virus can succeed, and there are still ways in which the White House could exert strong leadership to help that happen. But right now we are headed for a scenario of rising death rates and overwhelmed hospitals, shuttered schools and empty stadiums and cancellations everywhere.
Combine this scenario's inevitable economic consequences with the optics of the president's blundering and solipsistic response, and the coronavirus seems very likely to doom Trump's reelection effort, no matter where he casts the blame.
And how ironic that would be. In 2016 we elected a China hawk who promised a "complete shutdown" in response to foreign threats, a germaphobic critic of globalization who promised to privilege the national interest above all.
Now he is in danger of losing his presidency because when the great test came, in the form of a virus carried by global trade routes from communist China, he didn't take the danger seriously enough.

Texto completo: A national report released Tuesday said an unidentified Spokane man donated thousands of dollars to a white nationalist group through the community's Innovia Foundation.
The foundation's board of directors approved the grant over the objections of Innovia's former CEO Mark Hurtubise, according to emails and memos.
The disclosure follows the release of a Southern Poverty Law Center and Council on American and Islamic Relations study that included the $5,000 donation to a group called VDARE as part of its investigation into hate-free philanthropy. The report cites the Spokane-based foundation's 2018 tax forms detailing the donation, and that Hurtubise, who served as the organization's president from 2005-17, refused to sign off on the grant prior to his departure from the foundation after it was requested by the donor.
VDARE bills itself as a "nonprofit journalistic enterprise," but it espouses views that one political scientist told The New York Times amounted to "a pseudo-intellectual veneer to classic racism." On its website, VDARE - named for Virginia Dare, the first English child to be born in America, in 1587 - argues against diversity.
"America is not a melting pot, or a tossed salad or any other fashionable dietary metaphor that strips our nation of its rightful identity. We founded a country unique to history that has its own philosophies, values, social structure, attitudes, festivals, foods and aesthetic," the website reads.
Hurtubise said in an interview Tuesday that staff alerted him to the grant in late 2016, ahead of his planned departure that June. He shared his concerns with the chairman of the nonprofit's board after researching the organization and determining their values clashed.
"It's a community foundation, with the operative word being 'community,' " Hurtubise said. "A community, in this region, is made up of all its citizens."
Of VDARE, he noted: "They don't concur with that value."
Innovia CEO Shelly O'Quinn said the foundation performed its due diligence on VDARE and "had a conversation" with the donor about the grant recipient. The donor, whom Innovia will not identify, "expressed his support for the mission" of VDARE. O'Quinn, a former Spokane County commissioner, was not part of the initial decision by the then Inland Northwest Community Foundation, which was rebranded as Innovia in 2018.
"He requested to continue to make that grant," O'Quinn said. "In consideration of the donor's desire to support an education foundation, that actually is a legal charitable entity, the board decided to make that grant."
VDARE's stated mission is two-pronged, to educate the public on "the unsustainability of current US immigration policy and second, the 'National Question,' which is the viability of the US as a nation-state."
The money came through a donor-advised fund that Innovia administers. It is separate from the discretionary funds Innovia directly oversees, O'Quinn noted. The foundation's policies regarding donor-advised funds states their "function is advisory only, and that the ultimate authority to direct distributions from the fund is vested solely in the Board of Directors."
O'Quinn, who joined Innovia in 2017, stressed that the foundation is "committed to diversity, equity and inclusion."
"We have done board training, we've done staff training, and actually led community conversations around the fact that race matters," O'Quinn said.
If the VDARE donor were to request to make another contribution through Innovia, O'Quinn said "a conversation would be had with the donor" to determine whether or not Innovia would facilitate it.
"We continue to educate the donor on the challenges and the controversies around that organization, as per our policy," O'Quinn said. "We're continuing to educate the donor on those concerns around the organization. He, this donor, truly believes that this is an education foundation on immigration."
VDARE's website states that "mass immigration both legal and illegal has driven America to the verge of bankruptcy in the following areas: employment, real incomes, national security, crime, housing, health care, education, race relations and culture."
As it moves forward, O'Quinn said Innovia is working with new donors to ensure they understand the foundation's mission and core values.
"When you have historical funds, it's a different conversation," O'Quinn said.
Innovia is not the only community foundation in the country to grapple with this issue.
O'Quinn said the foundation continues to explore "what do we do when our donors want to make a grant that is not in alignment with our values as a foundation."
"There's no easy answer to that," said O'Quinn, who had not yet read the Southern Poverty Law Center report on Tuesday.
Innovia's latest tax filings list $6.8 million in grants to organizations in the Inland Northwest, including church organizations, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, local universities and nonprofits supporting parks, homeless services and the arts. Innovia also has funded local journalism and community forum projects in partnership with The Spokesman-Review.
The donor-advised fund has contributed less than $40,000 in total to VDARE, which O'Quinn contrasted with the more than $80 million Innovia has distributed during its 46 years in existence.
"We are doing such great work in this community and while we're not perfect, I would hate for all of that great work and impact we're having on our community  to get lost in this," O'Quinn said.
Hurtubise, a local attorney and former college administrator, led the foundation for 13 years. He asked the foundation's board to reject the grant to VDARE. In emails and memos regarding the VDARE grants, he argued the foundation was not legally required to give the money at the request of the donor. Hurtubise said the grant, which must be reported on the organization's tax filings, would also have a detrimental effect on the image of Innovia.
Hurtubise said he came forward shortly after he left the foundation in 2017 after reading a Spokesman-Review story recounting the case of a black man who was assaulted and called a racial slur. He said he advocated for more transparency in how community foundations, which are charitable grant-making groups that number more than 750 nationwide, dispense their funds to prevent anonymous donations to hate groups.
But Hurtubise would also not say who had given the money to grant to VDARE.
"That would be a violation of my fiduciary responsibility," he said, when asked who gave the money and how much.
VDARE's founder, Peter Brimelow, has rejected the label of white supremacist and told Slate in 2018 he is a "civic nationalist." He sued the New York Times in January for an article that called him an "open white nationalist."
Meg Miller, the president of Innovia's board of directors, declined to comment Tuesday.
Carol Wilson, a member of Innovia's Board of Directors, said she did not have time for an interview but that she was a part of the decision to award funding to VDARE. She "felt really good" about the foundation's review process.
"We had a very thoughtful conversation, a very sensitive conversation," Wilson said, adding that Innovia is "very committed to diversity and inclusion."
Betsy Wilkerson, a Spokane city councilwoman and a past and current member of Innovia's Board of Directors, said the decision to award VDARE a grant was made during the year she was not serving.
Wilkerson said she had not read the Southern Poverty Law Center Report, but based on discussion she's heard about the decision, "it does not make the hair on the back of my neck stand up."
"I know us to be pretty diligent," Wilkerson said.
Wilkerson said she would be open to a discussion about the foundation's direction of funds that are donor-advised, particularly as it engages with diverse communities.
"We have to be very upfront, if we're going to engage those communities, exactly where we stand. That will be critical," Wilkerson said.
Multiple members of Innovia's board of directors for fiscal year 2017 could not be reached on Tuesday, or declined to comment.

Texto completo: NEW YORK – Minutes before Judge James Burke announced that Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of two sex crimes, would spend the next 23 years behind bars, the 67-year-old addressed his past in court.
During his revealing, at times rambling, five-minute monologue, the formerly powerful producer admitted to losing his train of thought. He was not seen reading from notes, and he directed his words at victims Miriam “Mimi” Haleyi and Jessica Mann.
Weinstein was convicted on Feb. 24 of third-degree rape of aspiring actress Mann, 34, in a New York hotel room in 2013, and first-degree sexual assault of production assistant Haleyi, 42, in 2006.
“First of all to all the women who testified, I have great remorse for all of you,” he began, before speaking directly about the #MeToo movement, which began in October 2017 when dozens of women accused him of sexual misconduct. “I have great remorse for all the men and women who have gone through this crisis in our country right now. ”
Weinstein sentenced: Judge says Harvey Weinstein will spend 23 years behind bars
Weinstein brought up his past correspondence with the women, which was a big sticking point during the 23-day trial. (His defense team hoped the victims’ continued contact with Weinstein would bolster their argument that his relationships with the women were consensual. )
He told the court he reread his correspondence with the victims and saw their relationships as “a serious friendship, and that’s what I thought I had with you. ”
“I’m not going to say these aren’t great people. I had a wonderful time with these people. I’m confused, and I think men are confused,” he continued, turning his attention back to the #MeToo movement. “I think about the thousands of men and women who are losing due process, and I’m worried about this country. ”
Weinstein acknowledged his past bad behavior, which started with two exposés that ran in The New York Times and The New Yorker in October 2017 and detailed decades of reported abuse.
“Yes, I got in fights with my brother; yes, I said bad things to people, but there are so many people – thousands of people – who would say great things about me,” he said.
Turning his attention to his family life, and referencing ex-wives Georgina Chapman and Eve Chilton Weinstein, Weinstein offered some of the most revealing quotes of his statement.
“I would do a lot of things over. I would care less about the movies and care more about my children and my family. ”
He said he has had “no communication” with his grown children since the New York Times article about his behavior.
“I went to extraordinary lengths to hide my extramarital affairs,” he said adding that if he could he “would go back” and not have them. He said both of his ex-wives had “no idea. ”
“I may never see my children again,” he told the courtroom.
Weinstein said several times that he regretted his behavior.
“I understand, I empathize,” he said. “I’ve learned so many things. ”
He also discussed his past charitable contributions and the money he raised after 9/11 for victims and firefighters. He said he made a similar impact after Hurricane Sandy pummeled New York City, and he mentioned schools for which he had raised money.
At one point, Weinstein said that “I lost my train of thought. ” He added that he wanted to testify at his trial, “but I knew all these things the DA just said would come in the way. ”
He concluded: “I feel remorse for this situation. I feel it deep in my heart. I’m really trying to be a better person. Thank you, your honor. ”

'Ridiculously Disastrous': NFL, Players Nervously Await CBA Vote; League owners already approved a new collective bargaining agreement. Now it's up to the players—and there are outspoken players who don't want it to pass

Texto completo: The day after the last year's NCAA basketball national championship in Minneapolis last April, NFL executives and union leaders covertly gathered in the same city to begin discussions of a new collective bargaining agreement. The owners wanted more games. The players wanted more money. They were nowhere near agreeing to anything.
Eleven months later, there's a monumental deal on the table that the owners have already approved. But internal tensions over the CBA have reached new heights. The players are in the middle of voting on the proposed agreement, with some openly challenging its merits and pushing back against their own union. While people familiar with the players and owners have expected the deal to pass, the acrimony has reached the point that both sides have to prepare for the other possibility:
What happens if the deal is shot down?
"It's totally and ridiculously disastrous," said one executive if it didn't pass. "Everybody loses."
The stakes are lucrative even inside this lucrative sport. This year alone, it's worth at least $600 million—in new money—to current and former players, according to both league and union estimates. It could cue up a new round of media deals for the league, worth tens of billions. And it would guarantee no holdouts or lockouts—for fans, players and owners—in America's most popular league for another decade.
Executives familiar with both sides of the negotiations—both the players and the league—warned that if the players reject the current offer, a future deal would likely be financially worse for them.
But some players, including some of the most famous ones, have vocally expressed their opposition. They've voiced concerns over the deal's economics, its lengthy 10-year lifespan and that it could lead to a 17-game NFL season , one longer than is currently played, as soon as the 2021 season.
The discord among players over whether or not they should accept the deal has continued to ramp up. Before the Super Bowl, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman railed against the proposed arrangement, saying it was hypocritical for the NFL to say it cares about health and safety while asking the players to participate in an extra regular-season game. When representatives from all 32 teams voted on the deal, it passed narrowly with 17 yeses, 14 nos and one abstention.
People familiar with the negotiations say the internal rancor stems from the complexities of negotiating a deal on behalf of a union representing players with vast and often disparate interests. The star players who make tens of millions may have different motivations than others who make hundreds of thousands. Then there are the roughly 15,000 retired players, whose health plans and pensions would be dramatically affected.
"Good policy comes from guys having different opinions on what's important," said Eric Winston, the outgoing NFLPA president who helped lead the negotiations. "There's a lot of guys that value different things in different ways."
When the NFL and the NFL Players Association first met to discuss the CBA, each side had clear goals. The NFL wanted to expand the schedule. The NFLPA wanted to increase its revenue share and boost its working class, after it felt revenues from the last deal went disproportionately to a small number of highly-paid players.
Both sides got part of what they wanted. And that's the problem.
After initially pushing for a new 18-game season, owners eventually moved onto 17 games. The playoffs would also expand to include seven teams, from the current six. In exchange, the players' share of the revenue increases from 47% to 48%, and even higher than that once the league extends the season.
Some players, though, have fought back against the notion of playing more football. Others wanted more in return, such as a larger share of the pie or more dramatic reductions in training camp and practice time. They have also questioned the merits of agreeing to a CBA that lasts 10 years when so much can change in the interim.
And the gains in revenue don't affect every player evenly. Some of the most significant gains go to the league's lowest paid players: If the deal gets approved, those salaries would immediately rise from $510,000 to $610,000. The players also received increased roster sizes and increased benefits, including for retired players. Drug policies, including marijuana testing, and personal conduct discipline are also dramatically overhauled in the agreement.
Owners believed the deal would pass when they voted to approve it in February. A day later, though, the union leadership balked at voting until they met with ownership once more. Owners such as the Patriots' Robert Kraft and star players like Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers shuttled into Indianapolis for that meeting, which took place at the NFL's annual scouting combine.
Although the current deal runs through next season, ownership stressed to the players that both sides will make more money if they can renegotiate their lucrative media deals this summer with the promise of labor peace. They pointed toward the economy and threat of the coronavirus, and that was before the markets tumbled this week.
Afterward, when the players narrowly approved the deal 17-14-1, many high-profile players assailed the agreement. Union and league officials felt it could threaten a deal aimed to help the union's broader membership—more than half of whom are on deals near the minimum. They also grew concerned that some of the negative information being spread about the deal on social media was false, leading more players to oppose it.
As union members met in recent days, one player, offensive tackle Russell Okung, filed a complaint against the NFLPA with the National Labor Relations Board, saying it violated union rules in the negotiation, the New York Times first reported . The NFLPA denied violating its constitution, and Okung subsequently dropped out of the running to replace Winston as NFLPA president.
Then, Monday, after a weekend of player meetings, the "tide really turned," one person familiar with the conversations said, when they began comparing the current proposal with the last CBA side-by-side and observing the substantial differences and gains. The vote of the entire player body, initially scheduled to run through Thursday, was extended through Saturday.
Winston says he's not twisting players' arms. But he said he wants them to know that there are two doors. Door one is voting yes. Door two is voting no to try to get more, which puts the NFL and its players on a path toward a potential lockout.
In that case, Winston says: "Maybe you get a deal done. Maybe you don't."

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series: Navigating Healthy Families will present a young adult author event with award-winning novelist Nicola Yoon at 7 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, at Glenbard North High School, 990 N. Kuhn Road in Carol Stream.
Yoon’s books "Everything, Everything" and "The Sun Is Also a Star" skyrocketed to the top of The New York Times bestseller list and were National Book finalists for Young People’s Literature. "Everything, Everything" is about the thrill and heartbreak that happens when someone breaks out of their shell to do crazy, sometimes death-defying things, for love. "The Sun Is Also a Star" is a hopeful examination of self-determination, family and identity.
Yoon was born in Jamaica and graduated from Cornell University with a degree in engineering. She became a writer because she wanted her daughter, and other young multiracial youth, to see themselves in the pages of popular books. Yoon is associated with the We Need Diverse Books organization and promotes the representation of diversity in literature.
Yoon is also a recipient of the John Steptoe Award for New Talent. In her acceptance remarks, Yoon spoke of how books for young readers can (and need to) be mirrors.
"When I was growing up, I didn’t see a lot of characters that looked like me," she said. "I didn’t know that my interior life mattered."
It’s important to recognize that "we are more than a stereotype. We are more than the struggle. We get to have joy."
Students are encouraged to attend the March 18 event. Glenbard North students will hear Yoon speak during the day.
Continuing professional development units are available.

Coronavirus being 'closely monitored'

Texto completo: Lowcountry health and education officials said Monday they are monitoring coronavirus updates and following procedures outlined by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As of Friday, Beaufort Memorial Hospital is screening all patients who enter any of its providers with basic questions about travel and symptoms.
"We're screening at all of our points of entry as you receive health care," said Ashley Hildreth, corporate director of quality/patient safety.
"We are not screening visitors, for example, right now. We have kind of an escalating plan that we've created. As we need to, we can adjust to a higher level of screening, testing and more communication. We can continue to escalate that plan based on the things that are happening in our community."
Hildreth said Beaufort Memorial officials are independently monitoring the number of positive and negative tests in the state.
"As late as last week, we had only tested 10 people in the state of South Carolina. That number has increased over the weekend, as has the number of presumptive positive cases," she said. "So we're looking at those numbers and the volume of patients."
Hildreth said the number of flu patients increased last week compared to the previous two. The hospital hasn't increased staff members or hours but that could change if it implements an escalation plan.
"One of the biggest messages we are sending to patients is first of all, don't panic. And as we are learning more about the virus and the treatment of the virus and the testing associated with the virus, the processes do change," she said. "Sometimes that's frustrating for the public
because maybe what's in plan for the process today is not what's in process tomorrow."
DHEC said in a statement Sunday it is "closely monitoring a rapidly emerging outbreak of the novel coronavirus." It encouraged people to reach out to their local health provider if they have the symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath.
Heldreth said initially reaching out electronically or by phone is of importance right now.
"Eighty percent of the patients who have this virus do not actually have to seek health care within the four walls of a hospital, so we've been really making sure people are aware of our telehealth app," she said.
The app walks patients through a step-by-step screening.
"Not everybody that has the symptoms for coronavirus will have to be tested, just like not everybody who has symptoms of the flu gets tested," she said. "If we do some self-isolation when we have those symptoms and practice very good hand washing and kind of stay home until we're better, then you don't have to necessarily get the test.
"The only thing the test will do is confirm whether or not you do have it. There's no treatment for it. You treat it symptomatically just like you do the flu. So for fever, you use Tylenol."
She added that anyone who is very sick, however, should seek emergency attention immediately.
"Those 10 to 20 percent who have comorbidities or advanced age. We're very concerned about our patients who are immunocompromised, so patients with cancer or diseases like congestive heart failure," she said.
Hildreth said the public should seek trusted sources for coronavirus updates.
"Make sure the public is looking to appropriate websites for their information," she said. "The CDC (cdc.gov) is a great website. Our hospital site (bmhsc.org) has information that we are updating and reviewing daily. So as changes occur, make sure you're referring back to those places to get the best information."
A DHEC update released Monday afternoon said seven people in South Carolina have tested "presumptive positive" for coronavirus, meaning samples from the individuals tested positive at DHEC's public health laboratory but those results must be confirmed by the CDC. Two cases have been confirmed, one in Kershaw County and one in Charleston County.
The update said 31 individuals have been tested by the state and 24 have tested negative.
As of Monday afternoon, there had been at least 595 confirmed cases of coronavirus in 36 states, according to the New York Times tracking database. At least 24 patients have died, it said.
Hilton Head Regional Healthcare released a statement Monday afternoon about the coronavirus.
"Hilton Head Regional Healthcare is monitoring information from federal, state and local public health agencies for current information on the coronavirus," it said. "Our hospitals have taken the appropriate steps, and we have trained professionals and the necessary equipment to react accordingly.
"As with any communicable disease, as our patients enter the hospital in areas such as emergency department or registration, hospital staff are questioning all of their recent travel and detailing symptoms. We evaluate relevant symptom criteria and implement contact airborne isolation, if required, without delay."
The statement said clinical teams are in "constant review" of procedures and patient screenings as determined by the CDC.
"Testing is not conducted at our facility. If a patient presents at our hospital and meets CDC criteria, we work with our local health department and if appropriate, gather a sample for testing and provide it to a CDC appointed laboratory. We follow CDC guidelines for identification and treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus."
School districts
Beaufort County and Jasper County school district officials said they're closely monitoring DHEC updates and guidelines.
Beaufort County School District spokesman Jim Foster said schools are following the same guidelines and sanitation practices that they would during a typical flu season.
"Our focus is on prevention. Our custodial contractors are private sector contractors that work for us. They are using a hospital-grade disinfectant on all the surfaces and classrooms every night," he said.
Those surfaces include desks, door knobs, water fountains and anything else a student would touch routinely. Foster said teachers and other employees have been instructed to constantly remind students about the importance of washing their hands.
"And if you're sick, don't come to school. That seems silly, but it's really important," he said. "We're going to rely heavily on the experts at DHEC and CDC in determining what we're going to do next."
Foster said the superintendent and principals have discussed how they would handle instruction if schools are forced to close because of outbreak concerns. He said the conversations are ongoing.
"Online instruction is one option, but it can't be the only option because not every student in the district has internet access at home," he said.
Jasper County School District Spokesman Travis Washington released a statement Friday.
"Our administration, nursing staff, and operations team are making efforts to alert parents, as the need arises, pertaining to COVID-19," he said. "Last week we distributed a flyer to every student, teacher, and staff member which details how the disease is spread, who is at risk, what the symptoms are and advice on how to prevent the transmission of the disease.
"The main message that is being delivered to students and staff is to wash hands thoroughly and often, avoid touching others, and also for them to stay home if they are sick. As always, we intend to monitor and follow all DHEC guidance and safety guidelines."

"As with any communicable disease, as our patients enter the hospital in areas such as emergency department or registration, hospital staff are questioning all of their recent travel and detailing symptoms. We evaluate relevant symptom criteria and implement contact airborne isolation, if required, without delay."
The statement said clinical teams are in "constant review" of procedures and patient screenings as determined by the CDC.
"Testing is not conducted at our facility. If a patient presents at our hospital and meets CDC criteria, we work with our local health department and if appropriate, gather a sample for testing and provide it to a CDC appointed laboratory. We follow CDC guidelines for identification and treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus."
School districts
Jasper County School District Spokesman Travis Washington released a statement Friday.
"Our administration, nursing staff, and operations team are making efforts to alert parents, as the need arises, pertaining to COVID-19," he said. "Last week we distributed a flyer to every student, teacher, and staff member which details how the disease is spread, who is at risk, what the symptoms are and advice on how to prevent the transmission of the disease.
"The main message that is being delivered to students and staff is to wash hands thoroughly and often, avoid touching others, and also for them to stay home if they are sick. As always, we intend to monitor and follow all DHEC guidance and safety guidelines."

Texto completo: Correction published Thursday, March 12, 2020 - Jim Holloran (left) was shown in a photo at a McGurk's watch party. He was misidentified in a photo caption in Wednesday's A-section's primary coverage.
JEFFERSON CITY -- Democratic voters in Missouri signaled Tuesday they want former Vice President Joe Biden to take on President Donald Trump in November.
As votes were tallied, Biden backers were staring down a big win, rather than a repeat of four years ago when U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont split the delegate haul with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Shortly after polls closed at 7 p.m., both The Washington Post and The New York Times declared Biden the victor in Missouri. So did the Associated Press and CNN.
Biden's campaign said Missourians sent a clear message Tuesday.
"This is the campaign that will send Donald Trump packing. This is the coalition that can not only win the Democratic nomination, but can propel Democrats to victory this fall," a statement said.
Statewide returns showed Biden with a healthy lead. With 100% of precincts reporting, he had 60% of the vote, compared with Sanders' 35%.
While Biden was cruising in many of Missouri's counties, Sanders was running close in Boone County, home to the University of Missouri.
In St. Louis, city voters had Biden ahead 53-41 with 100% of the vote tallied. In St. Louis County, Biden won 65-29 with 100% of the vote reported. In St. Charles County, with 100% reporting, Biden led Sanders 62-34. In Jefferson County, with all precincts reporting, Biden had 58% of the vote to Sanders' 36%.
Tallya S. Wesley knew "in her soul" that Biden would win Missouri, she said at the campaign's watch party at McGurk's after early vote tallies projected Biden the winner shortly after polls closed at 7 p.m.
"I told them at campaign headquarters that this was going to be an early win," said Wesley, a grandmother and outreach minister from St. Louis' Walnut Park neighborhood.
"You could feel the momentum shift after Super Tuesday -- we're serious now. We're in the ninth inning."
Gerri Horn, a Biden volunteer, said she was surprised by the early call but had been certain Biden would "win big" in Missouri. Of at least 30 voters Horn spoke to while canvassing houses recently along Delmar Boulevard and in Riverview, only one person was not a Biden supporter, she said.
"He can get both sides together to agree and work on issues," said Horn, 67, of Hazelwood.
Both Wesley and Horn, lifelong Democrats, were among a bustling crowd of Biden supporters at McGurk's Tuesday that included people who had volunteered for Biden's past competitors and St. Louis officials including Board of Alderman President Lewis Reed and Kevin O'Malley, former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland under Obama.
At a campaign watch party for Sanders at Blueberry Hill, about three dozen supporters remained on hand shortly before 9 p.m.
Democratic congressional candidate Cori Bush addressed the group, which remained lively following an early projected win for Biden.
"I don't see one head down," said Bush, an activist involved in the Ferguson protests who is running against U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay in the August Democratic primary.
Electoral races can flip in a matter of days, Bush said, so supporters should get back to work to help boost Sanders' efforts in upcoming primaries in other states.
"This is not the end," she said. "Sleep tonight, get some rest, and let's get right back at it tomorrow. Maybe we didn't win it, but the next state can. This is still our moment."
TRUMP COASTS TO A GOP WIN
On the Republican side, President Donald Trump, who won the state by 19 points in 2016, appeared ready to capture all 54 GOP delegates in his bid for a second term.
In a statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez said 92% support he's received show Missourians are united behind the president.
"If Joe Biden is the best Democrats can put forward, Missourians can look forward to another four years of fairer trade deals, job growth and tremendous tax cuts under President Trump's administration," she said.
Voters also could choose primary ballots for the Constitution, Green and Libertarian parties.
Voting opened in Missouri after Biden won big on Super Tuesday, including convincing victories in Southern states where African Americans make up large parts of the electorate.
He also notched wins in Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas.
Among those backing Biden was Alie Kamara, a 34-year-old nurse's assistant in south St. Louis who immigrated from Sierra Leone six years ago.
Kamara voted for Biden because of Biden's experience. The economy was strong under President Barack Obama's administration, Kamara said, and he is confident Biden can return the country to the same position.
"It worked well for this country," Kamara said. "I believe that if he is going to be president again, after being vice president, he is going to do the same thing again."
At a polling place in Dutchtown, Don and Pat Duncan were motivated in large part by the issues of health care and minimum wage in their votes for Sanders.
"I figure, I'm on Medicare, and if it works for me -- and I'm quite happy with it -- why not have it for everybody," said Don Duncan, 68, a retired carpenter.
"This is the only country in the world where if you get sick you lose your entire life savings," Duncan said. "It's about time the United States catches up with the rest of the world."
Pat Duncan said she "probably could have gone either way" to vote for Biden or Sanders but opted for the latter because of his position for a $15 federal minimum wage.
As the day started, Biden had 670 delegates and Sanders 574, according to the Associated Press.
Missouri was among five states voting Tuesday, with Michigan being the biggest prize. Sanders won there in 2016, but did not repeat this time.
Neither Biden nor Sanders spent time in Missouri until the weekend before the vote. Bloomberg blanketed the airwaves in the weeks leading to Super Tuesday. It was only in the past week that Biden and Sanders got on the air, with Biden spending the most.
There were 68 delegates at stake here Tuesday: 44 will be awarded based on performance in each congressional district, and the remaining 24 will be apportioned based on the state's popular vote.
Missouri also has 12 "automatic" delegates to the Democratic National Convention -- elected officials and party leaders -- who aren't bound by the statewide results and can support any candidate.
VOTING GLITCHES
There were some hiccups at the polls.
Voters in St. Louis County experienced problems with the polling stations' poll books early Tuesday, said Eric Fey, Democratic director of elections.
The poll books were out of sync with receipt printers, but the issue was fixed by 7 a.m., Fey said.
"We have a manual backup process," he said. "It just took a while to fix that."
In north St. Louis, officials relocated the Ward 22 polling place on Martin Luther King Drive after a man backed a car into the building before entering and yelling threats, throwing things and pouring water on workers and voting machines.
In Kansas City, moments after he made a plea for people to get out and vote, Mayor Quinton Lucas was turned away from the polls and told he "wasn't in the system." He later learned his name had been entered into the system incorrectly and was able to cast his ballot.
For Republicans, the day was significantly different than the 2016 primary election, when Missouri voters gave Trump the nod over challenger Ted Cruz by less than one-half of 1%.
Democrat Hillary Clinton's margin was even closer over Sanders, who came within about 1,600 votes of the former Secretary of State.
In 2016, Sanders had performed well in counties with universities, as well as places with strong ties to labor unions, including St. Charles, Jefferson, St. Francois and Lincoln counties.
As the field narrowed from 20 Democratic candidates to the two front-runners, endorsements for Biden began to break his way. After remaining silent on her pick in the run-up to the election, state Auditor Nicole Galloway, who is running for governor against Republican Mike Parson, announced Tuesday morning that she had voted for Biden.
Among those backing Biden were St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, former U.S. Sen. Jean Carnahan and former Gov. Jay Nixon.

Harvey's suicidal despair revealed

Texto completo: Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, like fellow sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, considered suicide as his once-charmed life morphed into an endless nightmare.
The one-time producer of movies like "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction" was in a dark and despairing place after the first published allegations of his predatory behavior appeared in 2017, with the cinematic powerhouse suddenly a pariah reviled by family and friends, newly unsealed documents in Manhattan Supreme Court revealed.
"I have only despair," Weinstein (inset) wrote in one of the now-public papers, a draft of an unreleased statement dated Dec. 21, 2017. "I have lost my family. I have daughters that will not talk to me. I have lost my wife. I have lost the respect of my ex-wife and generally almost all of my friends. I have no company. I'm alone. And I will be honest with you: I'm suicidal."
"In addiction, we have to forgive ourselves. Yet, I find it impossible. I have devastated my friends and my family. I don't want to forgive myself, but if I roll up my sleeves, I can show the world the suffering I'm seeing on this journey."
Among the devastated family members: His older brother and ex-business partner Bob Weinstein. In a Nov. 2, 2017, email to Harvey, Bob ripped into the since-convicted sexual offender as a pathological liar and a rapist.
"Just read u been abusing women, when u were in your twenties," wrote Bob Weinstein. "Numbers are up to 82. U are world class, in that area. U deserve a lifetime achievement award for the sheer savagery and immorality and inhumanness, for the acts u have perpetrated."
More than 1,000 pages of documents were unsealed in advance of the 67-year-old defendant's Wednesday sentencing, with many depicting his abject desperation as his world crumbled in the wake of exposés by The New York Times and New Yorker. Both reported on allegations that he raped and abused scores of women over years of outrageous behavior.
The Weinstein legal team fought to keep many of the documents out of the trial, and they were kept under seal for two years. Their client faces a maximum of 29 years behind bars.
Weinstein, responding to a message from gossip columnist and television host A.J. Benza in November 2017, appeared to affirm that he was sexually abused as a child.
"It is (an) incident when I was a very young boy," wrote Weinstein in reply to a question from Benza. "I'm having a hard time. I beg (you) not to say anything. Please change (the) subject and delete this (I) am breaking ... (down) remembering I need your friendship. I want to be a writer."
In one email to Bloomberg, he writes, "Allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance. A lot of the allegations are false, and given therapy and counseling, as other people have done, I think I'd be able to get there."
Another email exchange referenced a supposed National Enquirer exposé alleging Weinstein sexually assaulted the actress Jennifer Aniston.
"Jen Aniston should be killed," wrote Weinstein during the back and forth.
A rep for Aniston declined to comment on the email and denied the allegations brought forth by The Enquirer.

Attorneys: Suspect offering plea deal

Texto completo: Attorneys for the man accused of being the Golden State Killer said Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. would be willing to plead guilty if prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty, according to new court papers.
The statement from the public defenders representing DeAngelo appears as a footnote in a 41-page dismissal motion filed this month in Sacramento County Circuit Court and obtained by the Los Angeles Times.
"Mr. DeAngelo is 74 years old. He has offered to plead to the charges with a lifetime sentence," the statement says.
Assistant public defender Joe Cress did not respond to a request to clarify the statement. Nor did Sacramento County prosecutor Anne Marie Schubert respond to a request for comment. But victims in the case told The Times they had received a letter from the public defender asking them to tell an independent mediator what they think about resolving the case without trial.
"I would be OK with that," said Kris Pedretti, who was 15 when she was raped in 1976. "But in exchange we want answers. Where he was. What he was doing. He owes us answers. Real answers."
A second victim voiced a similar opinion. Victor Hayes, who was held captive and threatened with death while his girlfriend was raped, said he is more interested in knowing details of how the crimes would have been committed by DeAngelo, a patrol duty police officer for the small northern California town of Auburn.
DeAngelo faces charges for 13 murders and 13 rape-related kidnappings in six counties. Beyond that, he is accused of some 50 rapes and scores of ransackings attributed to a serial predator who attacked women, men and children across a large swath of California in the 1970s and 1980s. He was arrested in April 2018 based on genetic DNA tracing through his relatives. Prosecutors allege that DNA retrieved from DeAngelo the day of his arrest matches that from eight of the crime scenes, but they have so far been stymied in collecting additional DNA samples from DeAngelo so that crime labs in those counties can run their own tests.
DeAngelo's arrest inspired dozens of other agencies to begin solving violent crimes similarly, fundamentally revolutionizing how cases across the country are investigated. The technique has generated a backlash from some genealogists, legal scholars and privacy advocates who are concerned that the police and the FBI are abusing these databases.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on executions in March 2019, but the death penalty remains legal in the state.

Texto completo: Back in 2014, the last time The New York Times' wine panel tried Rosso di Montalcino, one taster did not restrain himself in criticizing the wines.
"I think Chianti blows these wines away," said Chris Cannon, a veteran restaurateur and wine expert who is now the managing partner of Jockey Hollow Bar and Kitchen in Morristown, New Jersey.
I disagreed with him back then, finding a lot to like in the bottles we tasted. But after the wine panel revisited Rosso di Montalcino recently, tasting 20 bottles from the 2016 and 2017 vintages, I have been rethinking my position.
I've been drinking a lot of Chianti Classicos recently, and have been thinking about the differences between the Chiantis and the Rossos, as well as their points in common.
They are both red wines of Tuscany, and expressions of the sangiovese grape. Maybe the similarities end there.
Chianti is from the hilly region between Florence and Siena. Unlike Rosso di Montalcino and its big brother, Brunello di Montalcino, which must both be 100% sangiovese, Chianti needs only to be 80% sangiovese.
In the best Chiantis, the remainder is generally made up of local grapes like canaiolo and colorino, or the wine is entirely sangiovese.
International grapes like cabernet sauvignon and merlot are permitted, and were once common additions.
But their presence, even in small percentages, often stuck out, and their popularity in the region has faded over the last 20 years.
The Montalcino zone is to the southwest of Chianti, and tends to be warmer and drier. The Montalcino wines are often denser and more muscular than the generally leaner and more angular ones made in the cooler Chianti region.
In both areas, wines can range from elegant to powerful, depending on the climate and composition of the soil, particularly its fertility and the presence of clay. But the power in the Montalcino wines tends to be amplified.
Brunellos have stringent aging requirements. They must wait at least four years after harvest before they can be released, including at least two years in wood. The category of Rosso di Montalcino was invented to provide cash flow to Brunello producers during this long aging process. Rossos need to be aged only one year after harvest, including six months in barrels.
Rossos also help producers to improve their Brunellos by providing a destination for grapes that they do not want to put into their top wines, either because they are from young vines or for any other reasons.
This is one explanation for the varying quality of Rossos: Some producers regard Rosso as an easy, delicious wine entirely apart from their Brunellos, and create their cuvees to fulfill their vision. Other winemakers use it as a dumping place for grapes or wines that they do not think measure up.
Chianti Classico, like Rosso, must age a year before it can be sold. Other categories, like Chianti Classico Riserva and Gran Selezione, must age for longer periods, though not as long as Brunello di Montalcino. In the end, straightforward Chianti Classico is not a bad comparison point for Rosso di Montalcino.
For this recent Rosso tasting, we all shared a general sense of disappointment in the wines. They were inconsistent, which was not unexpected. After all, the 2016 and 2017 vintages were very different. In 2016, the growing season was long and moderate, and many of the wines have been described as fragrant and nuanced, while '17 was hot and dry, producing wines that were often exuberantly fruity.
Inconsistency might also be attributed to differences in microclimates, altitude and soils, with some of the wines coming from limestone, sandstone and marl, and others coming from clay-rich soils.
More telling than inconsistency, however, we found too many bottles to be unbalanced, dominated either by tannins or acidity or a lack of one or the other. And in quite a few bottles, possible intricacies were overwhelmed by richness, sweetness and power, regardless of the vintage.
That said, the wines we did like were balanced, combining bittersweet fruit flavors with lively acidity, earthiness and the sort of structure indicating that the wines would be capable of aging for five to 10 years. None had the dusty purity, grace or transparency that I have enjoyed in so many Chianti Classicos, but those are not qualities I've often seen in Rosso di Montalcinos.
Still, we did like quite a few of the wines. Our favorite was the 2016 Uccelliera, rich and tannic, with earthy, lingering flavors of sweet and bitter red fruits. Right behind it was the sweet, spicy and floral 2017 Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona, which was also our best value at $25.
Interestingly, these producers are neighbors in the Castelnuovo dell'Abate zone in the southeast of Montalcino, one of the region's warmer areas. The wines are full-bodied but not at all overripe or forced, to use Thera's term.
Our No. 3 bottle, the lively, pure and structured 2017 Mastrojanni, is also from the southeast.
The 2016 Fonterenza was our No. 4 bottle, but in some ways I think it had the potential to be the best in the tasting.
It came from the Sant'Angelo region in the south, but from higher-altitude vineyards, and was quite floral, textured and energetic. It was a bottle that we all felt would improve with additional aging.
In the end, despite our mixed feelings about the tasting, I resist disparaging the whole category as Cannon did at our 2014 tasting. I've had too many of these wines that I have liked.
Still, the number of unbalanced wines was unsettling. It's hard to believe in a category more than the producers themselves do.
If a thing is worth doing, as countless parents have scolded, it's worth doing well. Right now, with these wines, the potential is there, but value and pleasure are not always delivered.

Tasting notes
Uccelliera Rosso di Montalcino 2016, $29: Rich, tannic and structured, with earthy, lingering flavors of sweet and bitter fruits.
Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona Rosso di Montalcino 2017, $25: Best value. Sweet and spicy floral aromas, with clear, balanced, bittersweet red fruit and mineral flavors.
Mastrojanni Rosso di Montalcino 2017, $27: Lively, pure and structured, with earthy flavors of ripe, red fruits.
Fonterenza Rosso di Montalcino 2016, $48: Floral, richly textured and energetic, with firm tannins and flavors of red and dark fruits. Should improve with time.

A jazz-hands novel from Colum McCann Collage effect used to illustrate tragic deaths Review

Texto completo: Colum McCann's new novel, "Apeirogon," is based on an uplifting true story. It's about two fathers - Rami Elhanan, an Israeli, and Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian - who each lost a young daughter to senseless violence. They have become friends and work together, through an organization called Combatants for Peace, to bring the opposing sides together.
McCann takes their story and drops it to the ground, where it shatters. To read "Apeirogon" is to watch him pick up the shards. As befits a writer who ruminates about the nature of storytelling, there are 1,001 of these shards, each numbered, in an homage to "One Thousand and One Nights," the collection of Middle Eastern folk tales.
This is an early warning sign. It is possible to admire "One Thousand and One Nights" while having learned through hard experience that a writer who derives too much inspiration from it is generally one to avoid, unless what's desired is a self-inflicted intellectual glitter-bombing. Time magazine film critic Stephanie Zacharek, writing on Twitter, recently called "storytelling" a "jazz-hands word." "Apeirogon" is a jazz-hands novel.
In many of McCann's 1,001 shards, we follow Rami and Bassam in something like real time. They attend meetings, give lectures, worry about crossing border checkpoints. In others, we flash back to earlier points in their lives. From multiple angles, we witness the events that led to their daughters being killed. Rami and Bassam no longer want to silo their suffering. They want for their grandchildren what the narrator of Israeli writer David Grossman's novel "See Under: Love" wanted, "to live in this world from birth to death and know nothing of war." You sense you would like Rami and Bassam if you got to know them.
But we are not allowed to settle into the texture and nuance of their experience. We're evicted from the narrative on almost every page so that McCann can tweezer in arty and only vaguely relevant facts.
He's going for a collage effect. He'd like to chime with Shirley MacLaine in "The Apartment," who looks into a broken mirror and says to Jack Lemmon: "I like it that way. Makes me look the way I feel."
McCann's shards are set apart from one another on the page by a thumb's-width of white space. This trending method of organizing a novel (for example, Jenny Offill) is not yet insufferable but has a trap door: It exaggerates a writer's weaknesses.
Offill's weakness is that, despite her comic tone, her wit can fizzle. McCann's is that, even in his best novels, such as the National Book Award-winning "Let the Great World Spin," his work can be humorless and self-important.
"Apeirogon" - the title refers to a shape with a limitless number of sides - is so solemn, so certain of its own goodness and moral value, that it tips almost instantly over into camp, into corn. It's as if the author were gunning for the Paulo Coelho Chair in Maudlin Schlock.
In an author's note at the front of this novel, McCann writes: "We live our lives, suggested Rilke, in widening circles that reach out across the entire expanse." McCann has a gift for quoting others at their most flatulent: "The only interesting thing is to live, said Mitterand"; "Hertzl wrote: If you divide death by life, you will find a circle."
For added effect, McCann repeats lines he likes, such as the Mitterand quote, again and again.
McCann's numbered shards - they ascend from 1 to 500, then turn and begin to descend - offer structure in place of content. "Apeirogon" is not a meal but a table littered with ingredients: a paw of garlic, a frozen lamb shank, two potatoes, a big knob of celeriac, three peas.
When you insist on a lot of white space between paragraphs and sometimes between single sentences, and if your work is humid, the effect can unintentionally verge on the amusing. Each sentence has an apricot-colored scarf tied around its neck. And it's as if the reader has been given 10 seconds and a bong hit between each one; time to squint and nod and say, "So true."
As with Bob Geldof speaking of Ethiopian famine at the time of Live Aid, McCann's ardor is unmistakable. But his analysis of the predicaments that face the Middle East is not raw or original or sophisticated. His message is optimistic - we need to talk more, and understand each other's humanity - and banal.
Great writing, Walt Whitman wrote, is composed of words that are "whirled like chain-shot rocks." Enough rocks have been whirled in the Middle East. And this novel is only tossing around pillows.

In both areas, wines can range from elegant to powerful, depending on the climate and composition of the soil, particularly its fertility and the presence of clay. But the power in the Montalcino wines tends to be amplified.
Brunellos have stringent aging requirements. They must wait at least four years after harvest before they can be released, including at least two years in wood. The category of Rosso di Montalcino was invented to provide cash flow to Brunello producers during this long aging process. Rossos need to be aged only one year after harvest, including six months in barrels.
Rossos also help producers to improve their Brunellos by providing a destination for grapes that they do not want to put into their top wines, either because they are from young vines or for any other reasons.
This is one explanation for the varying quality of Rossos: Some producers regard Rosso as an easy, delicious wine entirely apart from their Brunellos, and create their cuvées to fulfill their vision. Other winemakers use it as a dumping place for grapes or wines that they do not think measure up.
Chianti Classico, like Rosso, must age a year before it can be sold. Other categories, like Chianti Classico Riserva and Gran Selezione, must age for longer periods, though not as long as Brunello di Montalcino. In the end, straightforward Chianti Classico is not a bad comparison point for Rosso di Montalcino.
For this recent Rosso tasting, we all shared a general sense of disappointment in the wines. They were inconsistent, which was not unexpected. After all, the 2016 and 2017 vintages were very different. In 2016, the growing season was long and moderate, and many of the wines have been described as fragrant and nuanced, while '17 was hot and dry, producing wines that were often exuberantly fruity.
Inconsistency might also be attributed to differences in microclimates, altitude and soils, with some of the wines coming from limestone, sandstone and marl, and others coming from clay-rich soils.
More telling than inconsistency, however, we found too many bottles to be unbalanced, dominated either by tannins or acidity or a lack of one or the other. And in quite a few bottles, possible intricacies were overwhelmed by richness, sweetness and power, regardless of the vintage.
That said, the wines we did like were balanced, combining bittersweet fruit flavors with lively acidity, earthiness and the sort of structure indicating that the wines would be capable of aging for five to 10 years. None had the dusty purity, grace or transparency that I have enjoyed in so many Chianti Classicos, but those are not qualities I've often seen in Rosso di Montalcinos.
Still, we did like quite a few of the wines. Our favorite was the 2016 Uccelliera, rich and tannic, with earthy, lingering flavors of sweet and bitter red fruits. Right behind it was the sweet, spicy and floral 2017 Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona, which was also our best value at $25.
Interestingly, these producers are neighbors in the Castelnuovo dell'Abate zone in the southeast of Montalcino, one of the region's warmer areas. The wines are full-bodied but not at all overripe or forced, to use Thera's term.
Our No. 3 bottle, the lively, pure and structured 2017 Mastrojanni, is also from the southeast.
The 2016 Fonterenza was our No. 4 bottle, but in some ways I think it had the potential to be the best in the tasting.
It came from the Sant'Angelo region in the south, but from higher-altitude vineyards, and was quite floral, textured and energetic. It was a bottle that we all felt would improve with additional aging.
In the end, despite our mixed feelings about the tasting, I resist disparaging the whole category as Cannon did at our 2014 tasting. I've had too many of these wines that I have liked.
Still, the number of unbalanced wines was unsettling. It's hard to believe in a category more than the producers themselves do.
If a thing is worth doing, as countless parents have scolded, it's worth doing well. Right now, with these wines, the potential is there, but value and pleasure are not always delivered.
Tasting notes
Uccelliera Rosso di Montalcino 2016, $29: Rich, tannic and structured, with earthy, lingering flavors of sweet and bitter fruits.
Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona Rosso di Montalcino 2017, $25: Best value. Sweet and spicy floral aromas, with clear, balanced, bittersweet red fruit and mineral flavors.
Mastrojanni Rosso di Montalcino 2017, $27: Lively, pure and structured, with earthy flavors of ripe, red fruits.
Fonterenza Rosso di Montalcino 2016, $48: Floral, richly textured and energetic, with firm tannins and flavors of red and dark fruits. Should improve with time.

Texto completo: On Monday, when the Florida House briefly shut down because of coronavirus fears, Republicans did this:
They passed House Bill 1059, labeled as a "Parents' Bill of Rights." Among other things, it would make it easier for parents to refuse vaccinations for their children.
As researchers work furiously to develop a vaccine for the disease that is near pandemic stage and threatens the global economy, Republicans would make it harder to contain the next outbreak. Among the yes votes were state Reps. Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point, and Michael Caruso, R-Delray Beach.
Under current law, parents can refuse to vaccinate children for medical reasons or by using a religious exemption. There is no personal exemption.
But based on the recurrence of measles, which the United States had eradicated, Florida should end the often-abused religious exemption. HB 1059 would take Florida in the opposite - and dangerous - direction.
Many health experts believe that this coronavirus - COVID-19 - will become endemic, reoccurring every season like the flu. A COVID-19 vaccine thus would become an annual procedure.
Many Americans, however, don't even get the flu vaccine. For 2018-19, the coverage rate was just 45.3%. The rate for children was 62.6%.
One might argue that COVID-19 fears would force even skeptics to get vaccinated. But with President Trump calling the disease a "hoax" and many of his science-denying right-wing media allies echoing that theme, who knows?
Before the epidemic, Trump and congressional Republicans may have thought that they wouldn't have to dwell on health care during their campaigns. Though the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments this year on the GOP's attempt - which Trump supports - to overturn the Affordable Care Act, the court won't rule until 2021.
But they will have no such luck. Indeed, from Trump on down, the near pandemic has refocused attention on health care and made Republicans look like buffoons.
Last week, Trump tried to pass himself off as a public health expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He claimed that coronavirus tests were available nationwide. They weren't.
This week, Trump's Florida cheerleader - U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz - had to self-quarantine. During debate on the $8.3 billion coronavirus response bill, Gaetz wore a gas mask to mock the severity of the outbreak.
Closer to home, Gov. Ron DeSantis presides over bureaucratic paralysis as Florida responds to the epidemic. The main policies of the Florida Department of Health appears to be making virus testing as restrictive as possible and stonewalling the public on developments.
DeSantis' fellow Republican, Sen. Rick Scott, demanded more transparency. In a letter to federal and state health officials, Scott called the lack of information about deaths in Lee and Santa Rosa counties "alarming." But Scott has no high ground on this issue.
As governor, Scott - like Trump - cut money for public health. He refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Both actions made it harder for the state to fight the Zika virus outbreak in 2016.
And remember that Scott and DeSantis are jockeying to be Florida's top Republican presidential candidate in 2024. Scott has every reason for trying to look good at the governor's expense.
Finally, there's Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump will dump from the ticket if he doesn't make the administration's coronavirus response look at least mildly competent. As a New York Times article put it, Pence is Trump's "political janitor."
Pence, however, made another mess on Monday. He claimed that because the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had designated the coronavirus test an "essential health benefit," all insurance plans would cover it.
Not really. A fellow at the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Institute for Health Policy told Kaiser Health News, "There are many things wrong with that statement."
Ironically, by referring to "essential health benefit," Pence was borrowing from the Affordable Care Act, for which his administration has no replacement if the courts abolish it. Cheaper plans that Trump has touted don't come with that mandatory coverage.
Perhaps the Florida Senate will reject the "Parents Bill of Rights." Perhaps congressional Republicans will see the threat that the Trump administration's coronavirus stumbles pose for their party in November. As an issue, health care is coming at the GOP. What will be the party's response?

Takeaways from Super Tuesday

Información de publicación: Reno Gazette - Journal ; Reno, Nev. [Reno, Nev]. 11 Mar 2020: A.6.

Texto completo: Super Tuesday has come and gone. A total of 1,357 delegates (34 percent of the total) were allocated to various candidates on March 3. While most of the delegates from the Super Tuesday are still in the process of being allocated, there are clear trends that give us a good idea of where things are headed in the Democrat nomination contest.
Swing state problem: Bernie has had strong performances in New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, Colorado and Minnesota. They are all swing states in the general election. Twelve percent of Bernie supporters in 2016 voted for Trump in the general election (source: NPR). Expect that number to be higher this time if Bernie is not the nominee.
Racial divide: Blacks are going strong for Biden; Hispanics are going strong for Bernie. In a two-man race, this is an interesting dynamic to watch. The Hispanic factor could easily swing Nevada red if Bernie is not the Democrat nominee.
Biden's gaffes get worse: During his Super Tuesday victory speech, he confused his wife for his sister. A day before, he called it "Super Thursday" before stopping himself. He called Chris Wallace "Chuck" (as in Todd). During the debate he claimed 150 million American lives (about half of the total population) were lost to gun violence since 2007. He botched the Declaration of Independence during a rally in Texas with, "All men and women created ... by the — you know — you know the thing." A single miss is not an issue. Taken collectively, this pattern of miscues is disquieting. Biden, once a dominant figure in American politics, appears to be headed in the wrong direction cognitively at a crucial time.
More progressive weapons backfire: Progressive activists constantly entered Trump rallies in the lead-up to the 2016 election. While I fully recognize one's rights to peaceful protests, entering another person's event to disrupt proceedings clearly crosses the line. That weapon has now turned against the Democrats. Amy Klobuchar had to cancel a rally when protestors stormed the stage. Joe Biden's victory speech was interrupted by protestors nearly endangering the former vice president's physical safety. Bernie's rally in Carson City was interrupted by protestors last month.
Networks deceive: Networks kept "calling" the race and putting a check mark next to the candidate like it is the general election. Somehow, they ignored the fact that unlike the general election, where it is winner-take-all, the Democratic primary allocates delegates proportionally. Take Texas as an example. At last check, Biden had bagged 81 delegates and Bernie had won 72 delegates. Yet the networks declared Biden a "winner" a few hours after the polls closed.
One final point: Just before the South Carolina primary, fresh off a massive win in Nevada, Sanders appeared to have a clear path to the Democrat party nomination. The New York Times interviewed 93 un-elected "superdelegates." According to The Times, they were committed to stopping Sanders even if it meant intraparty damage. This adds fuel to the Bernie Bros.' perception they are being cheated.
Following Biden's victory in South Carolina and on the eve of Super Tuesday, Klobuchar, Buttigieg and O'Rourke all endorsed Biden. The day after Super Tuesday, Bloomberg dropped out and endorsed Biden. The timing of these endorsements will sure come across to Bernie supporters as an organized attempt by the party to stop Bernie. If Bernie does not win the nomination, these endorsements will come back to haunt the Democrats in the general election and for years to come.

Mandy Moore finds ultimate 'collaborator'

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Crossroads Church leverages donations to wipe out $46.5 million in medical debt

Texto completo: Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing.
He spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his Nov. 23 sermon, entitled "The Marks of Multiplication." Tome said members of the congregation could text "MULTIPLY" to 313131 to help "free others from medical debt," but insisted the campaign was not a challenge.
Just an awareness.
It was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity.
"When we are in debt, a sin debt to God, we can't get our way out of the sin debt to God," he said during the sermon. "Jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt, so we never have to worry about God hurting us for our sin."
Crossroads could give to free others' debt, too, he said. And for every dollar they raised, Crossroad's partner RIP Medical Debt would leverage that dollar to abolish $100 in medical debt, therefore multiplying the church's impact.
Within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.
Over $42 million of those funds came back to Ohio families.
"Most of it probably that weekend," said Crossroads director of marketing Brennan Hill. "Cuz I think most people, if I had to guess, were doing it in real time. You know, if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in."
Church officials announced the impact of their campaign on Feb. 23.
Most of the funds came back to Ohio families since the church is based out of the Cincinnati region. But the sermons are streamed online, which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate.
RIP Medical Debt is able to track the donations back to their original ZIP codes to give back. So, if you donated from Indiana, your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in Indiana.
In Ohio, church officials say, they have abolished $42.8 million in debts across 41,233 households in 103 ZIP codes.
They also abolished $1.9 million in debt across 2,974 Kentucky households, $1.5 million across 503 Tennessee households and $200,000 across 136 Indiana households.
What is RIP Medical Debt? An article posted by USA Today last year explains that RIP Medical Debt is a nonprofit organization based out of Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs.
The article said medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26 percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59 percent reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.
"How sad that probably the only debt that you don't choose to get – cuz you don't choose to get sick – and it's the one that's affecting most people," said Victor Martinez, spiritual growth site leader for the Oakley location.
When a person can't pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people's debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors.
But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.
To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual and $52,000 for a family of four), have debts that are 5% or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.
Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap.
Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.
A debt that never goes away... even if you don't know about it According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt. This rule is called the statute of limitations, and is six years in Ohio.
This means that for any type of debt, a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years, according to America's Debt Help Organization. That timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt. The clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up.
Martinez says that because of this law, many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to Crossroads didn't even know they had medical debt. If it was after those six years, hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling.
"If those six years pass, then nobody can give you a call asking for that money," Martinez said. "But you still owe that money, technically. And the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy, or if you pay for it."
Medical debt never goes away. It will stay on your record if you don't pay it. The law just states that if you don't pay it within that six year window, people will stop asking you to pay – not that you are off the hook.
Martinez said that now that he understands how the law works, he's afraid to call and ask if he owes anything. Because, what if he owes a lot of money? He'll be accountable to pay it, he said.
"That is very scary," he said. "Because what if I have medical debt that I don't know about?"
'A great analogy to what Jesus did for us.' Crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them.
"We kept it off social media," Hill said. "We really want it to be about people in our community, like I said, who are currently giving."
Crossroads members don't know who specifically they have impacted. They could not choose whose debt to pay off. In a letter to each debtor, Crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need, whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community.
"We don't want this to be the last interaction that we have with them, but there are no strings attached," Hill said."We just hope that they understand who Crossroads is, what our heart is for the community, maybe set foot in one of our sites."
This whole experience has been a great analogy to what Jesus did for us, Martinez said.
"Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt," Martinez said. "And here, we don't know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven."
According to RIP Medical Debt, Crossroads' campaign is its largest amount of medical debt that's ever been retired. The nonprofit's site claims that its partnerships have erased almost $1.4 billion in medical debt to date.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING — Tom Izzo admits his opinion of the coronavirus doesn't matter.
But Michigan State's Hall of Fame coach and the rest of the college basketball world is dealing with the reality of ripple effect COVID-19 is having – at the biggest possible moment in his sport.
The Ivy League canceled its postseason men's basketball tournament on Tuesday morning and plans to "implement highly-restrictive, in-venue spectator limitations" for other on-campus sporting events. That announcement came about an hour before Izzo's weekly news conference to preview the Spartans' trip to Indianapolis for the Big Ten tournament.
The 25th-year coach gave a wide-ranging, nearly 51/2-minute response to a question about what precautions MSU is taking heading into the tournament that begins Wednesday and if he had heard from the conference and NCAA about what is ahead.
"I feel bad for anybody that has gotten the virus, and I feel bad for the people that are trying to figure this out. But I don't know where it's heading," Izzo said. "It seems like it's getting to a drastic state right now if they're canceling some of these things. I'll just act accordingly."
Missouri-Kansas City (at Seattle) and Chicago State (at Seattle and Utah Valley) both canceled men's basketball road games last week because of the coronavirus outbreak. Chicago State also was considering not traveling to Las Vegas for this week's Western Athletic Conference tournament.
Last week, the NCAA created a coronavirus advisory panel, comprised of "medical, public health and epidemiology experts ... to guide its response to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease."
On Tuesday afternoon, NCAA president Mark Emmert released a statement, stating that individual schools and conferences "make their own decision regarding regular season and conference tournament play.
"Neither the NCAA COVID-19 advisory panel ... nor the CDC or local health official have advised against holding sporting events," Emmert also said in the statement. "In the event circumstances change, we will make decisions accordingly."
The New York Times on Saturday reported the NCAA is considering using fewer sites for the 68-team tournament due to concerns, as well as potentially holding games without spectators or proceeding normally with an emphasis on promoting public health. Brian Hainline, the NCAA's chief medical officer, told the Times it seemed "hard to imagine" the tournament would be canceled.
"I'm just gonna wait and see what the people say and do whatever they say," Izzo said. "If they say we play in empty arenas, we play in empty arenas. If they say we play in full arenas, we play in full arenas.
"I'm amazed how this has taken off and the little I know about it. It's been an incredible reaction so far."
Here are Izzo's full comments:
Q: "Tom, I'm curious, with all the travel coming up, everyone is trying to limit the coronavirus. Have you heard anything from the Big Ten or the NCAA about possible precautions they might use?"
IZZO: "You know, I haven't. I'm amazed how this thing has taken on a life of its own. And unfortunately, even all I've been through this year – which I've been through a lot of things outside my basketball hat that I wear – I have not been called by anybody on disease control. I do not know anything about it. I rely on our doctors here, I rely on our medical people here, I rely on medical people around the country. I don't know if we're looking at something that people are doing because it's, politically, the right thing to do. ]
"I hear some of the things that they're doing. I don't know if there's a halfway point. We either gotta figure out that we're not doing some things or we figure out that we are doing some things. But I promise you, my thought on it shouldn't matter, it won't matter. I'm just gonna wait and see what the people say and do whatever they say. If they say we play in empty arenas, we play in empty arenas. If they say we play in full arenas, we play in full arenas.
"I'm amazed how this has taken off and the little I know about it. It's been an incredible reaction so far."
Q: "The Ivy League canceled theirs."
IZZO: "Yeah, so what does that mean? I don't think it means the doctors at Harvard know more than the doctors anywhere else. I don't now what that means. And it's nothing to make fun of. I can only go by the experts, you know? I have enough trouble coaching my team, so I'll leave that to them. But I don't know where it's heading.
"I have not, we have not been told – your question is have we been told anything? Nothing. I don't know anything. I'm just like you guys. Because you guys are all on Twitter, you hear it a hell of a lot earlier than I do."
Q: "Virus protection – are you guys doing anything as a program in terms of extra wipes or any precautions in this place?"
IZZO: "I just got a feeling no matter what I say, I've had some situations these last year that no matter what I say, I'm gonna be taken wrong.
"I'm one of those guys that I can't say I live my life precautiously. I don't worry about stepping off this stage – I don't want a ramp there, because I'll trip and fall. I wash my hands at various times during the day, but I don't go around with those bottles (of hand sanitizer). If I shake your hand, I'm shaking your hand, not elbow-bumping you or hip-bumping you. I don't do those things, so that's me. I respect those that do. And if a doctor says to me, 'Tom, don't shake your players' hands or don't be around them when they're sweating or don't go in large groups,' I'll do that. But the precautionary things we're gonna do are probably the same as you should do with every walk, every bit of life that you live – that's to get some rest, take care of yourself, eat right. All of the things you guys don't do and that I don't do a very good job of, either. But that's what you want to do.
"I'm hearing all these things out there, but I'm not hearing really what you should do. Stay away from crowds? I don't know that. So I'm just gonna continue to do what they tell me to do. Nobody's done anything precautions. They've told me to wash my hands. My mother since I was 4 – never did it then, and look at me now. I feel bad for anybody that has gotten the virus, and I feel bad for the people that are trying to figure this out. But I don't know where it's heading. It seems like it's getting to a drastic state right now if they're canceling some of these things. I'll just act accordingly."

Campers remember Camp Kinderland

Texto completo: Camp Kinderland was a summer camp established in 1923 at Sylvan Lake in Hopewell Junction by the Workmen's Circle, an American Jewish organization that promotes social and economic justice.
The group was founded in 1900 by people working in the organization's New York City schools.
When a committee was formed to locate a property to open a children's camp, its members learned of a recently bankrupt camp at Sylvan Lake. The organization reached an agreement to rent the site for one year, with an option to purchase it for $35,000, which occurred after one season.
Its first year's campers totaled less than 100 but Camp Kinderland grew in popularity, registering close to 500 children for the two-month season a decade later. By that time, campers occupied more than 30 bungalows and tent sites erected on the grounds.
Within a year or two, Jacob Levine, one of the committee members, left Camp Kinderland, distressed over the fact that communists controlled the operation. In 1930, the leftist wing of the Workmen's Circle, along with Camp Kinderland, split off to form the International Worker's Order and the camp was formally sponsored thereafter by the Jewish People's Fraternal Order.
Camp Lakeland was established in 1941 as an associated adult camp on the same property. Typically, children sent to camp from Manhattan took the Day Liner up the Hudson River to Poughkeepsie and were met and transported to Camp Kinderland by bus. This was done to save gasoline.
California's Ellie Bisberg, now 91, first attended Camp Kinderland in 1939 and eventually became a counselor there. She met future husband Gene Bluestone there in 1946 and the couple staged their wedding at the camp in 1949.
"Gene was a gangster from Brooklyn but in 1945, when his gang decided to buy guns, he and his best friend, Blackie Davidman, left," she said. "Blackie's father got them jobs at Camp Kinderland and that's how I met Gene.
"We wanted to get married at Camp Kindeland because we met there."
Gene Bluestone, who died in 2002, went on to become an acclaimed author, folk musician and an English professor at California State University at Fresno.
In consort with Camp Kinderland's motto, "summer camp with a conscience," in addition to regular children's camp activities, programs also stressed the importance of equality, peace, social justice, activism, civil rights and friendship.
In 1949, renowned singer, actor and political activist Paul Robeson visited the camp and longtime Dutchess County resident Pete Seeger entertained campers on occasion. In 1956, the camp introduced its first Peace Olympics with teams named after international countries such as the United States, USSR, England, France, Israel and India, among others.
"Every year the camp staged a year-end event to show the kids that all people are equal and despite differences, we are all basically the same," said Mo Friedman, who attended Camp Kinderland in 1945. "The thrust of the camp was a progressive philosophy, which is why I was sent there by my parents.
"The camp's emphasis was not so much on sports but rather cerebral things. Of course, there was that beautiful lake for swimming and boating and that was part of it."
In 1971, its leaders decided to relocate the camp to another site. Camp Kinderland reopened in Fitchville, Connecticut, in 1972; moved to Honesdale, Pennsylvania, in 1973; and eventually purchased its present site in Tolland, Massachusetts, in 1976. Retaining the Sylvan Lake property, the Workmen's Circle reopened the camp there under the name Kinder Ring, which still exists.
Now in its 97th year of existence, Camp Kinderland still generates controversial attention based on its early history and philosophy. The New York Times ran a 2001 article about it titled "The Little Red Summer Camp" and in 2013, a documentary titled, "Commie Camp" was released by writer Katie Halper, herself a third-generation Kindlander.

Established in 1923 by the Workmen's Circle, an American Jewish organization that promotes social and economic justice, Camp Kinderland was located at Sylvan Lake in Hopewell Junction. Its dining hall, seen in this vintage postcard was named Red Square. In its early days, the camp was controlled by a communist faction of the group.

Texto completo: Florida's legislative session is about to end with one measure being debated that will have a dangerous impact on treating Floridians who may, or may not, be infected with the coronavirus.
SB 714 by Sen. Travis Hutson (R-Palm Coast) and HB 389 by Rep. Tyler Sirois (R-Merritt Island) have dramatically expanded the responsibilities of pharmacists to test, diagnose and treat people who walk into not only their local pharmacy, but now Florida's larger retail and grocery establishments such as CVS, Publix, Walgreen's and Walmart where non-symptomatic people come to shop for food and necessities for their families.
A recent New York Times article shared that pharmacists are overwhelmed with the responsibilities that they have right now, expanded responsibilities, such as testing, diagnosing, and treating for influenza and more will only increase the risk of mistakes and misdiagnoses.
Now is not the time to direct patients who are unsure if they have the flu, coronavirus, or a sinus infection into the public domain.
Ronald F. Giffler, M.D., Tallahassee
Editor's note: Giffler is president of the Florida Medical Association.
'Oh, the difference a virus can make' Rep. Bill Posey, a Rockledge Republican, has created a name for himself as the favorite congressman of the anti-vaccine movement. For the past decade he has trumpeted anti-vaxxer propaganda, and given those who want to believe it a congressional platform to spread disproved theories of the link between childhood vaccines and autism and debunked conspiracies of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) cover-ups.
As he told the Orlando Sentinel in August 2015, "It [the alleged link between vaccines & autism; which has been widely denounced] takes up an enormous amount of time. And it brings such criticism ... about 'what an idiot' I am."
And now, there is COVID-19.
On March 4, 2020, Congressman Posey signed on to a letter to the president "to express our strong desire for the Administration to prioritize resources to prevent, respond to and treat outbreaks of COVID-19". Resources? As in the CDC which Mr. Posey has been demonizing for years? Prevent? As in vaccines which Mr. Posey has been propagating misinformation about and fueling a sense of distrust and fear?
Oh, the difference a virus can make. Members of Congress are responsible for life and death issues that affect all Americans. Each representative has a duty to use their time wisely to protect and improve the quality of life for all. The business of Congress is serious. We need Congress members who will treat their obligation with the respect it deserves.

State must take care of Florida's bees Our state needs to do more to protect bees. The threat of colony collapse deserves immediate attention from our state policymakers. Bees are our most important pollinators —hundreds of thousands of plants depend on their pollination. Accordingly, large-scale bee deaths have dire consequences for our environment and global food supply.

Have millennials tossed thank-yous? I agree with Isadora Rangel that the common stereotype is not true for all millennials ('Here's what you get wrong about millennials," March 4).
However, there is one area of culture change that is very unique to them. Millennials do not like to express appreciation for any financial help or other support provided to them.
I have lost count how many times I have provided financial gifts and other support to millennials and never received a thank-you note. No snail mail, text, email, Skype or Instagram. Nothing. I base this on my personal experience which I have verified with friends, family and colleagues. While culture changes are inevitable, expressing appreciation is a common courtesy that has not gone out of style. This reflects badly on millennials. I know snail mail is passe with millennials, but how much time does it take to send a text message saying, thank you for the birthday, wedding or school gift?
This lack of courtesy can be partially blamed on parents for not teaching it. I still send out gifts to my millennial friends and family for any first special event and a congratulations card for a second event. If anyone is tasteless enough to ask why a gift was not included with the card, I just say the first gift must not have been appreciated, as I did not receive a thank-you note.

'Markets rise more than they fall' in end During the rhetoric of the presidential campaign, we kept hearing from Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders that the financial markets benefit mostly the bankers, fat cats and billionaires.
Imagine my surprise when I realized I must be a fat cat as I am not or ever have been a banker or certainly a billionaire. I realized this as I reviewed my brokerage account and was surprised to see it significantly diminished.
I guess I assumed that if the markets only benefit the above-mentioned on market increases, then it should not affect me on the decreases. Boy, was I wrong.
Actually, I knew better. I jest to point how wrong Warren and Sanders are. Anyone with a 401B, 401K or the various types of IRAs can see for themselves that the markets work for most of us by going up when markets rise and, consequently, down when markets drop. That is the nature of it but, over the long term, markets rise more than they fall, benefiting all of us.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

How the left can stop losing

Texto completo: How did the political left squander the opportunity that was the 2020 primary campaign?
The Trump presidency has created tremendous energy among progressives. More than half of Democratic voters now identify as liberal. Most favor "Medicare for All." A growing number are unhappy with American capitalism.
This year's campaign offered the prospect of transformational change, with a Democratic nominee who was more liberal than any in more than a half-century. Instead, the nominee now seems likely to be a moderate white grandfather who first ran for president more than 30 years ago and whose campaign promises a return to normalcy.
True, Bernie Sanders could make a comeback, but it would need to be a big one. Among people who voted on Super Tuesday itself - rather than voting early, before Joe Biden won South Carolina - Biden trounced Sanders. The race would have to change fundamentally for Sanders to win.
If he doesn't, the obvious question for progressives is what went wrong and how they can do better in the future. I think there are some clear answers - empirical answers that anybody, regardless of ideology, should be able to see. I'd encourage the next generation of progressive leaders to think about these issues with an open mind.
The biggest lesson is simply this: The American left doesn't care enough about winning.
It's an old problem, one that has long undermined left-wing movements in this country. They have often prioritized purity over victory. They wouldn't necessarily put it these terms, but they have chosen to lose on their terms rather than win with compromise.
You can see this pattern today in the ways that many progressive activists misread public opinion. Their answer to almost every question of political strategy is to insist that Americans are a profoundly progressive people who haven't yet been inspired to vote the way they think. The way to win, these progressives claim, is to go left, always.
Immigration? Most Americans want more of it. Abortion? This is a pro-choice country. Fracking? People now understand its downsides. Strict gun control? Affirmative action? A wealth tax? Free college? Medicare for All? Widely available marijuana? Americans want it all, activists claim.
This belief helps explain why so many 2020 candidates hoping to win the progressive vote - including Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris - embraced ideas like a ban on fracking and the decriminalization of the border. The left persuaded itself that those policies were both morally righteous and politically savvy. To reject any one of them was to risk being labeled a neoliberal sellout.
The thing is, progressive activists are right about public opinion on some of these issues. Most Americans do favor higher taxes on the rich, marijuana legalization and additional gun control. But too many progressives aren't doing an honest analysis of the politics. They are instead committing what journalist Matthew Yglesias has called "the pundit fallacy." They are conflating their own opinions with smart political advice. They are choosing to believe what they want to believe.
By designing campaign strategies for the America they want, rather than the one that exists, progressives have done a favor to their political opponents. They have refused to make tactical retreats, which is why they keep losing.
I think Warren may have been the person most damaged by this dynamic in 2020. (And, yes, she was also hurt by sexism.) She could have positioned herself as the candidate who excited much of the left but was more acceptable to the center-left than Sanders. Instead, she mimicked Sanders, making many Democratic voters who were rooting for her worried that, like him, she couldn't win a general election.
The progressive wing of the party has still had a good few years, pushing the party left in multiple ways. Even Biden's platform is strikingly liberal. But if progressives aren't satisfied being influential runners-up, I would suggest three broad principles.
First, don't become PINOs (progressives in name only). Decide on a few core ways in which you think moderate Democrats are wrong, and stake out different positions.
Second, stop believing your own spin. Analyze public opinion objectively. Acknowledge when a progressive position brings electoral costs.
Finally, start testing some new political strategies. A single break with orthodoxy can send a larger signal. It can make a candidate look flexible, open-minded, less partisan and more respectful of people with different views.
Maybe the new approach should involve economic progressivism and cultural moderation, which happens to reflect American public opinion. Maybe it involves a different approach on immigration - insisting on a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally but also a slowdown of future immigration. Maybe it means announcing that fracking and nuclear energy are crucial to fighting climate change. Or maybe it involves finding more progressive candidates who hunt or talk about their relationship with Jesus Christ and have some related policy positions.
I realize that political compromise usually feels unpleasant. But I'd ask: How does losing feel?

Coronavirus sick time: Congress should do the job if Florida won't Orlando Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: A lot of employers in Florida refuse to pay employees when they're out sick. And the state government isn't about to force employers to offer paid sick time. Legislators even passed a law prohibiting cities or counties from making employers do right by their employees.
Our last hope rests with Congress, where members of the House and Senate have introduced a bill intended to force employers to offer ailing employees paid time off during public health emergencies.
The issue has rarely been more relevant than it is today.
Hundreds of people have been infected with the coronavirus in the United States, and many more are expected to fall ill before this epidemic runs its course.
An essential component for limiting the spread is for people experiencing respiratory symptoms and fever to stay home from work.
As we noted in an editorial last week, that's a no-win decision for the many Floridians who work in the service industry and don't get paid for taking sick time.
At the end of last year Florida had nearly 1.3 million people working in the leisure and hospitality industries, nearly 300,000 of those in Central Florida, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The agency also estimates that just 58% of private-sector service workers nationwide get paid time off, compared with about 75% of the workforce as a whole.
Workers in the service industry may have no savings to fall back on during hard times. How can we expect them to stay away from their jobs when the stakes are so high, especially if they're not sure whether they have the coronavirus or some other illness with similar symptoms?
Two members of Congress - Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut - have proposed a bill that would:
*Require employers to let employees earn up to seven days of paid sick leave.
*During times of a public health emergency (like now), require employers to provide employees with 14 days of paid sick leave.
*Require employers to let employees use sick time when a public health emergency forces the workplace to close, forces school closings or requires quarantine for a family member.
Under this bill, everyone is better off - sick employees who stay home and healthy customers and co-workers who don't get exposed.
Florida's senators and representatives in Washington need to get on this bus.
That includes people like Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Donna Shalala, who were quoted in a McClatchy news article saying we should put our faith in the private sector to do the right thing.
"Sometimes things don't require government action, they require people to be decent human beings and do the right thing," Rubio said.
We have a different take: Sometimes things do require government action, like an epidemic that threatens the health of the American people and the American economy.
We have no doubt some companies will do the right thing. Orlando-based Darden Restaurants announced Monday it would start paying hourly employees when they're out sick. And Uber announced over the weekend that it would provide employees with up to 14 days of paid sick leave if they're quarantined or become ill with the disease.
Other employers think the right thing is confined to their bottom line, and that isn't going to change.
Congress should consider other measures that would ease the sting, like providing sick-time tax credits to companies during the current outbreak.
This is a time for bold moves to shore up the economy so that job creators don't go under. That's what it took to dig out from under the recession when Barack Obama was president.
But government rescue plans shouldn't focus solely on saving corporate America. Low-income families who labor without decent benefits cannot be left behind.
Let them stay home if they're sick, but don't ask them to make the impossible choice between doing that and financial survival. If Florida won't save workers from making that choice, Congress must.

Ex-ambassador at IU: Let diplomats do job

Texto completo: Of all the examples Marie Yovanovitch gave to illustrate the need to empower diplomats to do their jobs, none was more timely than what she said about coronavirus.
The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who gained public notice for her testimony in President Donald Trump's impeachment inquiry, spoke Friday at Indiana University in Bloomington. It was the same day the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Indiana.
If the U.S. had better relationships with China, the country where the disease originated, perhaps Americans would have had more information earlier, she said. Perhaps national health experts could have traveled to China sooner.
"It turns out that the truth matters," Yovanovitch said, "and epidemics can't be subdued by tweet."
The comment was one of several that drew applause from a crowd spread throughout the lower rows of the IU Auditorium. Yovanovitch was the final speaker in the fifth-annual America's Role in the World Conference. It was the first conference without one of the IU Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies' namesakes.
Richard Lugar, a Republican who represented Indiana in the U.S. Senate for 36 years and died last April, was honored throughout the two-day conference. Among the acknowledgements was the creation of the Richard G. Lugar Award. Yovanovitch was the first recipient.
"As you can see, this award sits atop a compass symbolically reflecting Sen. Lugar's principle of integrity," said IU President Michael McRobbie. "It also reflects what we have recently described as the obligations of a foreign service officer to remain faithful to her true north, as you have done so brilliantly in dangerous and challenging posts overseas, and as all of us have recently witnessed in Washington, D.C."
In prepared remarks that followed the award presentation, Yovanovitch recalled her first meeting with Lugar. In the early 2000s, she was a mid-level embassy officer in the Ukraine. He was traveling through the former Soviet Union to check on the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program he created with U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia.
It was late on a hot August afternoon. Yovanovitch greeted Lugar on the tarmac and told him Leonid Kuchma, the president of Ukraine, wanted to see him. Lugar asked when the meeting was, and Yovanovitch replied, "right now."
The audience laughed, but Yovanovitch assured the crowd no one thought the situation was funny at the time. While Lugar's staff expressed frustration, the senator was unflappable and gracious, she said. He used the hour-long ride from the airport to prepare for the meeting. When he arrived, Lugar pushed on curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and broader issues to advance the U.S. agenda.
The way Lugar responded to the unwelcome news after a long trip taught Yovanovitch an important lesson about how people should treat each other to get the best results.
Yovanovitch's prepared remarks preceded a conversation with Lee Feinstein, dean of the Hamilton Lugar School. The two worked together when Feinstein was a U.S. ambassador to Poland. He recalled her as someone who was professional and serious. She was never one to call attention to herself, he said, but last fall she found herself in the national spotlight. He asked how that felt.
To guide her, Yovanovitch said she thought about what mentors like her mother would have done. Then she also used what she called The New York Times test.
"If there's going to be a headline in The New York Times, what do you want it to say about you?" she said.

Izzo keeps MSU ready despite health scare

Texto completo: EAST LANSING — Tom Izzo admits his opinion of the coronavirus doesn't matter.
But Michigan State's Hall of Fame coach and the rest of the college basketball world is dealing with the reality of ripple effect COVID-19 is having – at the biggest possible moment in his sport.
The Ivy League canceled its postseason men's basketball tournament on Tuesday morning and plans to "implement highly-restrictive, in-venue spectator limitations" for other on-campus sporting events. That announcement came about an hour before Izzo's weekly news conference to preview the Spartans' trip to Indianapolis for the Big Ten tournament.
The 25th-year coach gave a wide-ranging, nearly 51/2-minute response to a question about what precautions MSU is taking heading into the tournament that begins Wednesday and if he had heard from the conference and NCAA about what is ahead.
"I feel bad for anybody that has gotten the virus, and I feel bad for the people that are trying to figure this out. But I don't know where it's heading," Izzo said. "It seems like it's getting to a drastic state right now if they're canceling some of these things. I'll just act accordingly."
Missouri-Kansas City (at Seattle) and Chicago State (at Seattle and Utah Valley) both canceled men's basketball road games last week because of the coronavirus outbreak. Chicago State also was considering not traveling to Las Vegas for this week's Western Athletic Conference tournament.
Last week, the NCAA created a coronavirus advisory panel, comprised of "medical, public health and epidemiology experts ... to guide its response to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease."
On Tuesday afternoon, NCAA president Mark Emmert released a statement, stating that individual schools and conferences "make their own decision regarding regular season and conference tournament play.
"Neither the NCAA COVID-19 advisory panel ... nor the CDC or local health official have advised against holding sporting events," Emmert also said in the statement. "In the event circumstances change, we will make decisions accordingly."
The New York Times on Saturday reported the NCAA is considering using fewer sites for the 68-team tournament due to concerns, as well as potentially holding games without spectators or proceeding normally with an emphasis on promoting public health. Brian Hainline, the NCAA's chief medical officer, told the Times it seemed "hard to imagine" the tournament would be canceled.
"I'm just gonna wait and see what the people say and do whatever they say," Izzo said. "If they say we play in empty arenas, we play in empty arenas. If they say we play in full arenas, we play in full arenas.
"I'm amazed how this has taken off and the little I know about it. It's been an incredible reaction so far."
Here are Izzo's full comments:
"Tom, I'm curious, with all the travel coming up, everyone is trying to limit the coronavirus. Have you heard anything from the Big Ten or the NCAA about possible precautions they might use?"
IZZO: "You know, I haven't. I'm amazed how this thing has taken on a life of its own. And unfortunately, even all I've been through this year – which I've been through a lot of things outside my basketball hat that I wear – I have not been called by anybody on disease control. I do not know anything about it. I rely on our doctors here, I rely on our medical people here, I rely on medical people around the country. I don't know if we're looking at something that people are doing because it's, politically, the right thing to do. ]
"I hear some of the things that they're doing. I don't know if there's a halfway point. We either gotta figure out that we're not doing some things or we figure out that we are doing some things. But I promise you, my thought on it shouldn't matter, it won't matter. I'm just gonna wait and see what the people say and do whatever they say. If they say we play in empty arenas, we play in empty arenas. If they say we play in full arenas, we play in full arenas.
"I'm amazed how this has taken off and the little I know about it. It's been an incredible reaction so far."
"The Ivy League canceled theirs."
IZZO: "Yeah, so what does that mean? I don't think it means the doctors at Harvard know more than the doctors anywhere else. I don't now what that means. And it's nothing to make fun of. I can only go by the experts, you know? I have enough trouble coaching my team, so I'll leave that to them. But I don't know where it's heading.
"I have not, we have not been told – your question is have we been told anything? Nothing. I don't know anything. I'm just like you guys. Because you guys are all on Twitter, you hear it a hell of a lot earlier than I do."
"Virus protection – are you guys doing anything as a program in terms of extra wipes or any precautions in this place?"
IZZO: "I just got a feeling no matter what I say, I've had some situations these last year that no matter what I say, I'm gonna be taken wrong.
"I'm one of those guys that I can't say I live my life precautiously. I don't worry about stepping off this stage – I don't want a ramp there, because I'll trip and fall. I wash my hands at various times during the day, but I don't go around with those bottles (of hand sanitizer). If I shake your hand, I'm shaking your hand, not elbow-bumping you or hip-bumping you. I don't do those things, so that's me. I respect those that do. And if a doctor says to me, 'Tom, don't shake your players' hands or don't be around them when they're sweating or don't go in large groups,' I'll do that. But the precautionary things we're gonna do are probably the same as you should do with every walk, every bit of life that you live – that's to get some rest, take care of yourself, eat right. All of the things you guys don't do and that I don't do a very good job of, either. But that's what you want to do.
"I'm hearing all these things out there, but I'm not hearing really what you should do. Stay away from crowds? I don't know that. So I'm just gonna continue to do what they tell me to do. Nobody's done anything precautions. They've told me to wash my hands. My mother since I was 4 – never did it then, and look at me now. I feel bad for anybody that has gotten the virus, and I feel bad for the people that are trying to figure this out. But I don't know where it's heading. It seems like it's getting to a drastic state right now if they're canceling some of these things. I'll just act accordingly."

Giving Rosso di Montalcino a 2nd look

Texto completo: Back in 2014, the last time The New York Times' wine panel tried Rosso di Montalcino, one taster did not restrain himself in criticizing the wines.
"I think Chianti blows these wines away," said Chris Cannon, a veteran restaurateur and wine expert who is now the managing partner of Jockey Hollow Bar and Kitchen in Morristown, New Jersey.
I disagreed with him back then, finding a lot to like in the bottles we tasted. But after the wine panel revisited Rosso di Montalcino recently, tasting 20 bottles from the 2016 and 2017 vintages, I have been rethinking my position.
I've been drinking a lot of Chianti Classicos recently, and have been thinking about the differences between the Chiantis and the Rossos, as well as their points in common.
They are both red wines of Tuscany, and expressions of the sangiovese grape. Maybe the similarities end there.
Chianti is from the hilly region between Florence and Siena. Unlike Rosso di Montalcino and its big brother, Brunello di Montalcino, which must both be 100% sangiovese, Chianti needs only to be 80% sangiovese.
In the best Chiantis, the remainder is generally made up of local grapes like canaiolo and colorino, or the wine is entirely sangiovese.
International grapes like cabernet sauvignon and merlot are permitted, and were once common additions.
But their presence, even in small percentages, often stuck out, and their popularity in the region has faded over the last 20 years.
The Montalcino zone is to the southwest of Chianti, and tends to be warmer and drier. The Montalcino wines are often denser and more muscular than the generally leaner and more angular ones made in the cooler Chianti region.
In both areas, wines can range from elegant to powerful, depending on the climate and composition of the soil, particularly its fertility and the presence of clay. But the power in the Montalcino wines tends to be amplified.
Brunellos have stringent aging requirements. They must wait at least four years after harvest before they can be released, including at least two years in wood. The category of Rosso di Montalcino was invented to provide cash flow to Brunello producers during this long aging process. Rossos need to be aged only one year after harvest, including six months in barrels.
Rossos also help producers to improve their Brunellos by providing a destination for grapes that they do not want to put into their top wines, either because they are from young vines or for any other reasons.
This is one explanation for the varying quality of Rossos: Some producers regard Rosso as an easy, delicious wine entirely apart from their Brunellos, and create their cuvées to fulfill their vision. Other winemakers use it as a dumping place for grapes or wines that they do not think measure up.
Chianti Classico, like Rosso, must age a year before it can be sold. Other categories, like Chianti Classico Riserva and Gran Selezione, must age for longer periods, though not as long as Brunello di Montalcino. In the end, straightforward Chianti Classico is not a bad comparison point for Rosso di Montalcino.
For this recent Rosso tasting, we all shared a general sense of disappointment in the wines. They were inconsistent, which was not unexpected. After all, the 2016 and 2017 vintages were very different. In 2016, the growing season was long and moderate, and many of the wines have been described as fragrant and nuanced, while '17 was hot and dry, producing wines that were often exuberantly fruity.
Inconsistency might also be attributed to differences in microclimates, altitude and soils, with some of the wines coming from limestone, sandstone and marl, and others coming from clay-rich soils.
More telling than inconsistency, however, we found too many bottles to be unbalanced, dominated either by tannins or acidity or a lack of one or the other. And in quite a few bottles, possible intricacies were overwhelmed by richness, sweetness and power, regardless of the vintage.
That said, the wines we did like were balanced, combining bittersweet fruit flavors with lively acidity, earthiness and the sort of structure indicating that the wines would be capable of aging for five to 10 years. None had the dusty purity, grace or transparency that I have enjoyed in so many Chianti Classicos, but those are not qualities I've often seen in Rosso di Montalcinos.
Still, we did like quite a few of the wines. Our favorite was the 2016 Uccelliera, rich and tannic, with earthy, lingering flavors of sweet and bitter red fruits. Right behind it was the sweet, spicy and floral 2017 Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona, which was also our best value at $25.
Interestingly, these producers are neighbors in the Castelnuovo dell'Abate zone in the southeast of Montalcino, one of the region's warmer areas. The wines are full-bodied but not at all overripe or forced, to use Thera's term.
Our No. 3 bottle, the lively, pure and structured 2017 Mastrojanni, is also from the southeast.
The 2016 Fonterenza was our No. 4 bottle, but in some ways I think it had the potential to be the best in the tasting.
It came from the Sant'Angelo region in the south, but from higher-altitude vineyards, and was quite floral, textured and energetic. It was a bottle that we all felt would improve with additional aging.
In the end, despite our mixed feelings about the tasting, I resist disparaging the whole category as Cannon did at our 2014 tasting. I've had too many of these wines that I have liked.
Still, the number of unbalanced wines was unsettling. It's hard to believe in a category more than the producers themselves do.
If a thing is worth doing, as countless parents have scolded, it's worth doing well. Right now, with these wines, the potential is there, but value and pleasure are not always delivered.
Tasting notes
Uccelliera Rosso di Montalcino 2016, $29: Rich, tannic and structured, with earthy, lingering flavors of sweet and bitter fruits.
Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona Rosso di Montalcino 2017, $25: Best value. Sweet and spicy floral aromas, with clear, balanced, bittersweet red fruit and mineral flavors.
Mastrojanni Rosso di Montalcino 2017, $27: Lively, pure and structured, with earthy flavors of ripe, red fruits.
Fonterenza Rosso di Montalcino 2016, $48: Floral, richly textured and energetic, with firm tannins and flavors of red and dark fruits. Should improve with time.

Texto completo: One Tuesday night in October 2018, John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery store chain, was having dinner at Cipriani, an upscale Manhattan restaurant when his daughter, Andrea, walked in.
She was on a date with a man Catsimatidis didn't recognize. After the couple sat down at another table, Catsimatidis asked a waiter to go over and take a photo.
Catsimatidis then uploaded the picture to a facial recognition app, Clearview AI, on his phone. The startup behind the app has a database of billions of photos, scraped from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
Within seconds, Catsimatidis was viewing a collection of photos of the mystery man, along with the web addresses where they appeared: His daughter's date was a venture capitalist from San Francisco.
"I wanted to make sure he wasn't a charlatan," said Catsimatidis, who then texted the man's bio to his daughter.
Andrea Catsimatidis said she and her date had no idea how her father had identified him so quickly.
"I expect my dad to be able to do crazy things. He's very technologically savvy," she said. "My date was very surprised."
Clearview was unknown to the general public until this January, when The New York Times reported that the secretive startup had developed a breakthrough facial recognition system that was in use by hundreds of law enforcement agencies. The company quickly faced a backlash on multiple fronts.
Facebook, Google and other tech giants sent cease-and-desist letters.
Lawsuits were filed in Illinois, Vermont and Virginia, and the attorney general of New Jersey issued a moratorium against the app in that state.
In response to the criticism, Clearview published a "code of conduct," emphasizing in a blog post that its technology was "available only for law enforcement agencies and select security professionals to use as an investigative tool."
The post added: "We recognize that powerful tools always have the potential to be abused, regardless of who is using them, and we take the threat very seriously.
Accordingly, the Clearview app has built-in safeguards to ensure these trained professionals only use it for its intended purpose: to help identify the perpetrators and victims of crimes."
The Times, however, has identified multiple individuals with active access to Clearview's technology who are not law enforcement officials.
And for more than a year before the company became the subject of public scrutiny, the app had been freely used in the wild by the company's investors, clients and friends.
Those with Clearview logins used facial recognition at parties, on dates and at business gatherings, giving demonstrations of its power for fun or using it to identify people whose names they didn't know or couldn't recall.
"As part of the ordinary course of due diligence, we provided trial accounts to potential and current investors, and other strategic partners, so they could test the technology," said Hoan Ton-That, the company's co-founder.
John Catsimatidis first heard about Clearview from his friend Richard Schwartz, another founder of the company, who served as an aide to Rudy Giuliani when Giuliani was mayor of New York. Last summer, Catsimatidis ran a trial project with Clearview at one of his markets. The company used the system to identify known "shoplifters or people who had held up other stores," Catsimatidis said.
"People were stealing our Häagen-Dazs. It was a big problem," he said. He described Clearview as a "good system" that helped security personnel identify problem shoppers.
BuzzFeed News has reported that two other entities, a labor union and a real estate firm, also ran trials with a surveillance system developed by Clearview to flag individuals they deemed risky.
The publication also reported that Clearview's software has been used by Best Buy, Macy's, Kohl's, the National Basketball Association and numerous other organizations.
When Clearview first developed its facial recognition service in 2017, Ton-That and Schwartz were uncertain about who might pay for it, and they courted a range of clients including real estate firms, banks and retailers.
At the same time, Clearview was seeking outside investment. Many of the individuals the company approached got personal logins to the app.
Clearview received a seed investment round of about $1 million in July 2018.
Its backers included the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist David Scalzo and Hal Lambert, an investor in Texas who runs an exchange-traded fund with the ticker symbol "MAGA," which tracks companies that align with Republican politics.
"I have the app," Lambert said in an interview. "I've used it to talk about what we're doing in the space. I show it to friends of mine, potential investors.
"They thought it was amazing," he added. "They say, 'How do I get that?' And I say, 'You can't.' "
When Clearview was seeking its Series A round of funding, which was completed in 2019, the startup contacted a number of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures. Access to the app was offered as a perk, according to people familiar with the company's fundraising attempts.
Ton-That contends that Clearview is doing nothing wrong - that his app simply replicates what other search engines do.
Instead of allowing internet users to search for people's public images by name, as one can do on Google, he said, Clearview allows them to do the search by uploading a face.
For now, it's a power that Clearview controls and can give out as it pleases.
In October, Clearview asked Nicholas Cassimatis, an expert on artificial intelligence, to help conduct an internal accuracy test. He did the work for free, he said, because he knew Ton-That socially. The test consisted of submitting the faces of 834 federal and state legislators. Clearview's algorithms accurately identified every one of the politicians.
After the test was complete, Cassimatis was allowed to keep Clearview's app on his phone. He said he had since run dozens of searches.
"I tested it in surprising places: smoky bars, dark places. And it worked every time," Cassimatis said. "It's road testing. I do it as a hobby. I ask people for permission. It's like a parlor trick. People like it."

Why is Rutgers still holding his $100,000 donation?

Texto completo: Convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein may be heading to prison, but Rutgers University won't let go of his money.
Rutgers has decided to hold on to a $100,000 gift from the disgraced Hollywood mogul to help fund a campus feminist studies program despite his dual convictions of rape and sexual assault and his scheduled sentencing today in New York State Supreme Court in lower Manhattan.
Weinstein, 67, faces up to 29 years behind bars. But he could get far less.
Attorneys for the Oscar-winning producer of such films as "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction" signaled that they plan to argue at Wednesday's hearing that Weinstein's frequent donations to educational and charitable causes is a reason to reduce his time in jail to a minimum of five years.
Weinstein's legal team does not mention his Rutgers donation in its letter to Judge James Burke. But the $100,000 gift to Rutgers remains as one of Weinstein's most controversial.
Weinstein's money is helping to pay for an endowed professorship named after feminist icon Gloria Steinem. His donation arrived at Rutgers just two months before his history of abusive behavior toward women was revealed in lengthy investigative reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker.
Rutgers at the time refused to send Weinstein's money back – or donate it to a charitable cause. Weinstein had not even been charged with any crimes yet.
But now, in the wake of Weinstein's conviction Feb. 24 in New York on charges of third-degree rape and first degree sexual assault against two women, that decision by Rutgers has resurfaced.
The verdicts followed a wrenching six-week trial that was considered a political and historical touchstone for the campaign to draw attention to sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinstein's conviction and likely prison sentence now begs this question: Why would any university use Weinstein's money to now fund studies in feminism?
In a statement Monday explaining why it was keeping the cash, Rutgers spokeswoman Dory Devlin pointed out that Weinstein was not the only donor. More than 425 people contributed $3 million to the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies.
Devlin, the senior director of Rutgers News & Media Relation, said Weinstein and his family's foundation contributed the $100,000 in August 2017 in honor of his late mother, "who shared Gloria Steinem's hopes for female equality."
Devlin added that Rutgers believes "that applying these funds to advance women's equality has been a good use of the donation."
She said the money "helped fund the endowed chair's efforts to teach, conduct research and immerse students in debate and scholarship on the relationships between media, politics, market forces and democracy."
In its statement, Rutgers did not comment on Weinstein's conviction — or the seeming contradiction of partially funding women's studies with money from a rapist. Also, neither Steinem nor the current Rutgers chair of feminist studies, Naomi Klein, responded to requests for comment.
Weinstein's possible prison sentence looms as yet another chapter in what has become known as the #MeToo movement.
In recent years, numerous women have come forward with accusations that led to the downfall of a wide variety of influential men, ranging from Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota to CBS executive Les Moonves and NBC's Matt Lauer.
Weinstein is considered the most notorious of the bunch, however. And his trial was viewed as one of the first legal tests of efforts to not only force sexual offenders from their jobs but to send them to jail.
In its pre-sentencing letter to the judge, Weinstein's defense team wrote that he suffered a "historic" fall from grace as a result of the #MeToo movement.
Nearly 90 women in the film industry, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchette, Rosanna Arquette and Rose McGowanaccused Weinstein of some form of sexual misconduct or harassment.
Most of those incidents could not be cited in the New York trial, however. They either took place outside New York or were beyond the statute of limitations for crimes. Other incidents did not amount to crimes but were considered by prosecutors to be improper workplace harassment.
Weinstein's trial in New York focused on just two non-celebrity women — an aspiring actress and a production assistant for the TV show, "Project Runway."
The actress, Jessica Mann, said Weinstein raped her at a Manhattan hotel. The production assistant, Miriam Haley, said Weinstein forced her to let him perform oral sex on her.
But the women's testimony was complicated by the fact that each conceded they maintained cordial relationships with Weinstein after their assaults and even engaged in consensual sex with him. Mann, now 34, called Weinstein a "soulmate." Haley, 42, who is sometimes referred to as "Mimi Haleyi," admits she flirted with Weinstein.
In an attempt to show Weinstein's predatory style, Judge Burke allowed prosecutors to introduce testimony from four other women including Sopranos star Annabella Sciorra who said Weinstein raped her in the 1990s.
The prosecution's gamble failed. The jury of seven men and five women found Weinstein not guilty on the two most serious charges of predatory sexual assault, which could have resulted in a life sentence for him. Weinstein was also acquitted of first degree rape.
In an 11-page court filing last week calling for a lengthy prison sentence, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office resurrected its argument about Weinstein's history of alleged abusive behavior.
Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, in highlighting three dozen uncharged incidents, wrote that Weinstein carried on a "lifetime of abuse towards others, sexual and otherwise."
"Starting in the 1970s, he has trapped women into his exclusive control and assaulted or attempted to assault them," Illuzzi-Orbon said.
Most likely, Weinstein will get at least a five-year prison term — and possibly something longer. He faces another criminal trial in Los Angeles on charges that he raped one woman and sexually assaulted another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013. Law enforcement officials in Great Britain and Canada are also reportedly investigating Weinstein on sexual charges.
The accusations against Weinstein first emerged in October 2017 in reports in The New York Times and in The New Yorker. They coincided with a report two months earlier that Rutgers had accepted a gift of $100,000 from Weinstein for the Gloria Steinem chair.
Critics quickly demanded that Rutgers send the money back to Weinstein – or donate it to another charity. Rutgers refused, even though the University of Southern California turned down Weinstein's donation of $5 million to endow scholarships for women filmmakers.
At the time, Rutgers called the allegations against Weinstein "appalling and indefensible."
But it said "more work is needed to advance women's equality" and Weinstein's donation "will help those efforts."
"We think devoting these funds to advance women's equality," Rutgers said in a statement, "is a better use of the dollars than returning the donation to Harvey Weinstein and the H. Weinstein Family Foundation."
After his conviction nearly three weeks ago, Weinstein was taken to New York's Bellevue Hospital Center, complaining of chest pains. Doctors eventually inserted a stint in arteries leading to his heart.
In addition to citing his donations, Weinstein's legal team also plans to mention his medical problems as a reason for a reduced prison sentence. During the trial, Weinstein used a walker to come to and from the court.
Since leaving Bellevue's prison ward last week, Weinstein has been confined to a special hospital ward at the Rikers Island correctional facility. He reportedly fell there last weekend while trying to walk on his own.
"He fell on his head and thinks he has a concussion," said Weinstein's spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, adding, "He's miserable but trying to be optimistic as best he can. He has had a lot of time to think about his life and be humbled, but he thinks it's going to be a long, uphill battle from here."

Texto completo: Often, the goal when making drinks at home is to, well, drink at home. It's not to try a new technique, buy an obscure bottle you'll use only a quarter ounce of, or wait 20-plus minutes for a cocktail - that's what bars are for.
There is, however, one major lesson to be learned from the bar: You should be salting your cocktails.
Bartenders often add dashes of salt to cocktails for the same reason a pastry chef would never skip it in a chocolate cake batter. It just bolsters flavor.
The add is not meant to be enough to actually make a drink taste salty. Rather, "salt is a key ingredient when you're trying to create something with depth," said Dorothy Elizabeth, a bar manager at Mr Lyan, a bar group with locations in London, Amsterdam and Washington. "Sodium ions block bitter flavors, emphasize sweetness, and create really nice depth and dimension."
Most drinks benefit from a hit of salinity, but if you're new to seasoning your cocktails, start by adding a pinch to a drink that leans bitter, such as a Negroni.
"It mellows out the taste of the Campari," Elizabeth said. "You're able to round out and create richer, fuller flavors without necessarily modifying anything - just through the addition of salt."
Another drink that greatly benefits from a grain or two is one that contains fresh citrus, like the margarita. Just as salt dampens the bitterness in a Negroni, it intensifies the palate's ability to sense sweet and sour notes. Add it to heighten the flavors in your next sidecar, caipirinha or gimlet.
As for salt type, raid your kitchen. Kosher salt, fleur de sel and flaky sea salts like Maldon or Jacobsen all work well to balance and brighten without overwhelming. Since the meaning of a pinch differs from one person - and salt - to the next, most bartenders use a low-concentration saline solution to ensure consistency. But Elizabeth leaves the dropper at work.
"If I'm making drinks at home, you better believe I'm just pinching it and putting it directly in my drink," she said.
For Elizabeth, a pinch means a few small flakes of sea salt, no more. Keep your additions to a minimum and remember that - just as when seasoning a savory dish or offering to drive someone to the airport - once it's out there, you can't take it back. A small pinch is enough to shift and enhance the flavor profiles of your cocktail. Begin with restraint, and add a few flakes later if needed.
Next time you're mixing a favorite cocktail, grab your salt dish or shaker from the kitchen and experiment with it. Divide the drink between two glasses, and add a tiny pinch of salt to one of them. Soon enough, that other shaker may find a permanent home on your bar.

Unmasking the power of Clearview App used by police started as secret toy for the connected

Texto completo: One Tuesday night in October 2018, John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery store chain, was having dinner at Cipriani, an upscale Manhattan restaurant when his daughter, Andrea, walked in.
She was on a date with a man Catsimatidis didn't recognize. After the couple sat down at another table, Catsimatidis asked a waiter to go over and take a photo.
Catsimatidis then uploaded the picture to a facial recognition app, Clearview AI, on his phone. The startup behind the app has a database of billions of photos, scraped from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
Within seconds, Catsimatidis was viewing a collection of photos of the mystery man, along with the web addresses where they appeared: His daughter's date was a venture capitalist from San Francisco.
"I wanted to make sure he wasn't a charlatan," said Catsimatidis, who then texted the man's bio to his daughter.
Andrea Catsimatidis said she and her date had no idea how her father had identified him so quickly.
"I expect my dad to be able to do crazy things. He's very technologically savvy," she said. "My date was very surprised."
Clearview was unknown to the general public until this January, when The New York Times reported that the secretive startup had developed a breakthrough facial recognition system that was in use by hundreds of law enforcement agencies. The company quickly faced a backlash on multiple fronts.
Facebook, Google and other tech giants sent cease-and-desist letters.
Lawsuits were filed in Illinois, Vermont and Virginia, and the attorney general of New Jersey issued a moratorium against the app in that state.
In response to the criticism, Clearview published a "code of conduct," emphasizing in a blog post that its technology was "available only for law enforcement agencies and select security professionals to use as an investigative tool."
The post added: "We recognize that powerful tools always have the potential to be abused, regardless of who is using them, and we take the threat very seriously.
Accordingly, the Clearview app has built-in safeguards to ensure these trained professionals only use it for its intended purpose: to help identify the perpetrators and victims of crimes."
The Times, however, has identified multiple individuals with active access to Clearview's technology who are not law enforcement officials.
And for more than a year before the company became the subject of public scrutiny, the app had been freely used in the wild by the company's investors, clients and friends.
Those with Clearview logins used facial recognition at parties, on dates and at business gatherings, giving demonstrations of its power for fun or using it to identify people whose names they didn't know or couldn't recall.
"As part of the ordinary course of due diligence, we provided trial accounts to potential and current investors, and other strategic partners, so they could test the technology," said Hoan Ton-That, the company's co-founder.
John Catsimatidis first heard about Clearview from his friend Richard Schwartz, another founder of the company, who served as an aide to Rudy Giuliani when Giuliani was mayor of New York. Last summer, Catsimatidis ran a trial project with Clearview at one of his markets. The company used the system to identify known "shoplifters or people who had held up other stores," Catsimatidis said.
"People were stealing our Häagen-Dazs. It was a big problem," he said. He described Clearview as a "good system" that helped security personnel identify problem shoppers.
BuzzFeed News has reported that two other entities, a labor union and a real estate firm, also ran trials with a surveillance system developed by Clearview to flag individuals they deemed risky.
The publication also reported that Clearview's software has been used by Best Buy, Macy's, Kohl's, the National Basketball Association and numerous other organizations.
When Clearview first developed its facial recognition service in 2017, Ton-That and Schwartz were uncertain about who might pay for it, and they courted a range of clients including real estate firms, banks and retailers.
At the same time, Clearview was seeking outside investment. Many of the individuals the company approached got personal logins to the app.
Clearview received a seed investment round of about $1 million in July 2018.
Its backers included the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist David Scalzo and Hal Lambert, an investor in Texas who runs an exchange-traded fund with the ticker symbol "MAGA," which tracks companies that align with Republican politics.
"I have the app," Lambert said in an interview. "I've used it to talk about what we're doing in the space. I show it to friends of mine, potential investors.
"They thought it was amazing," he added. "They say, 'How do I get that?' And I say, 'You can't.' "
When Clearview was seeking its Series A round of funding, which was completed in 2019, the startup contacted a number of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures. Access to the app was offered as a perk, according to people familiar with the company's fundraising attempts.
Ton-That contends that Clearview is doing nothing wrong - that his app simply replicates what other search engines do.
Instead of allowing internet users to search for people's public images by name, as one can do on Google, he said, Clearview allows them to do the search by uploading a face.
For now, it's a power that Clearview controls and can give out as it pleases.
In October, Clearview asked Nicholas Cassimatis, an expert on artificial intelligence, to help conduct an internal accuracy test. He did the work for free, he said, because he knew Ton-That socially. The test consisted of submitting the faces of 834 federal and state legislators.
Clearview's algorithms accurately identified every one of the politicians.
After the test was complete, Cassimatis was allowed to keep Clearview's app on his phone. He said he had since run dozens of searches.
"I tested it in surprising places: smoky bars, dark places. And it worked every time," Cassimatis said. "It's road testing. I do it as a hobby. I ask people for permission. It's like a parlor trick. People like it."

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Accepting 'alternative facts' on virus has scary implications A virus respects no ideological borders, so the right wing's refusal to respect reality puts everyone at risk.

Texto completo: There's an old song by The O'Jays that seems especially apropos to this moment. The refrain goes: "Those lies done caught up with you this time."
The song was about a faithless lover getting her comeuppance. But it also works as a verdict on so-called conservatives in an age of looming pandemic.
At this writing, there have been, according to a New York Times database, 955 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 - caused by the novel coronavirus - in the United States; 29 of the afflicted have died. Meantime, the stock market has dropped like a boulder from a cliff, colleges are canceling classes and sports leagues are preparing to play in empty arenas. Internationally, 114,000 people have been stricken. All of Italy is on lockdown. Spain has shuttered every nursery school, high school and university in and around Madrid and a St. Patrick's Day parade has been called off - in Dublin.
Those are the grim facts. But the view from inside the facts-resistant bubble that passes for conservatism these days is quite different.
If you live in there, you've heard Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh assure you that the virus that has galvanized doctors around the world is really just "the common cold" weaponized to hurt Donald Trump. You've seen U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida mock concerns over the virus by wearing a gas mask in the Capitol; he has since had to self-quarantine after a possible exposure, though he announced Tuesday he tested negative for the virus. Meantime, King Liar himself, Trump, keeps doing what comes naturally.
He said that a vaccine will be ready in just a few months. It won't.
He said that the number of Americans afflicted is going down. It isn't.
He said that anyone who needs a test can get one. They can't.
He said that the World Health Organization gave "a false number" in predicting a global mortality rate of 3.4 percent. And on what basis did he question a respected international organization of medical professionals? Trump said he had a "hunch."
Then there's this recent tweet from writer Jelani Cobb of The New Yorker: "Overheard from the person in front of me on line at CPAC last week: 'I don't believe anything the CDC says about this virus. It's full of deep staters who want to use this to create a recession to bring down the president.' " As it happens, it was at CPAC - the annual Conservative Political Action Conference - that Gaetz, the Florida congressman, was apparently exposed.
You can't make this stuff up. But that doesn't stop right-wingers from trying.
It was in 2005 that Stephen Colbert coined the word "truthiness" to describe the then-new phenomenon of Americans prioritizing information they "felt" to be true over that which objectively was. Though restricted to no ideology, truthiness was much more common and - through a nexus of cable news, the internet and various integrity-free politicians - much more encouraged on the political right.
In 2005, the danger of this may have felt somewhat abstract - a decline in the quality of political discourse. But by 2016, when a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle in a Washington pizzeria because he believed a debunked anti-Hillary Clinton conspiracy theory, it was already glaringly clear that "alternative facts" could have dangerous, real-world implications.
Now there is this. One wonders if it will be the breaking point; if, faced with direct risk to their own lives, conservatives will finally quit drinking from the glass of mass delusion. Let's hope so, for all our sake. A virus, after all, respects no ideological borders, so the right wing's refusal to respect reality puts everyone at risk.
With apologies to The O'Jays, those lies done caught up with us all.

Texto completo: The Clam Shack in Kennebunkport - one of the best-known seafood shacks in the state - closed two weeks ago on the property next door, 4 Western Ave., which had been the home of the Ports of Italy Italian restaurant since 2015. Owner Steve Kingston tells me he plans to open a sit-down seafood restaurant there, and promises more details as they are finalized.
Meanwhile, Sante Calandri, owner of the Ports of Italy, plans to open a new location this spring at 141 Commercial St. in Rockport. The original Ports of Italy in Boothbay Harbor is still open.
full sit-down service ends at huot's
Huot's Seafood Restaurant at 29 Eastern Ave. in Saco (at Camp Ellis) announced Monday that when it re-opens in April, it will be abandoning sit-down service in favor of take-out and counter service. The 85-year-old business will still have both indoor and outdoor seating, and full bar service. "When the weather warms up, we will have more outdoor activities and seating with sunshade protection," the owners wrote on their Facebook page.
Say Aloha
Julie and Don Martin traveled to Hawaii last summer to attend a friend's wedding. While there, they enjoyed some Hawaiian shave ice and "we kind of fell in love with it," Julie Martin said.
When they came home, Don dug out an old ice cream maker from his mom's garage and tried to replicate the macadamia nut ice cream that formed the base of the shave ice they'd tasted, "and it came out really good," he said. He also bought a shave ice machine so the couple could make shave ice at home, "and I didn't complain," Julie Martin said.
Now the Martins, who both work at Scales restaurant in Portland (he as a bartender, she as a server), plan to launch a shave ice food cart in Portland this spring. (They plan to stay on at Scales at least through summer.) Their cart will be called Haole Ice; haole is a Hawaiian term for people who are not native Hawaiian, especially a white person.
Shave ice often starts with a base of ice cream, which is loaded with shaved ice, syrups of various flavors and toppings such as condensed milk, mochi balls or adzuki beans.
Don Martin, who has plenty of experience making syrups on the job, will develop his own flavors, from the traditional pineapple, strawberry, lychee and mango to macha tea, sage and passion fruit, basil, sweet corn, and - in tribute to Maine - blueberry and maple. "We'd like to get funky with some flavors, too, and see how they sell," he said.
A regular Haole Ice will cost $3-$4 (depending on syrups and toppings) and a large will cost $4-$7.
Watch this space, as well as the @haoleice Instagram account, for updates and details on a free pop-up the couple is planning. They want to hand out free samples so they can get the rest of Portland as enthused about shave ice as they are. "It changed my life," Don Martin said, "and I want to give that to everybody as well."
Portland bartenders kill it
Monday night, for the second year in a row, a bartender from Portland Hunt & Alpine Club won the regional Speed Rack competition at the Royale Nightclub in Boston. Speed Rack is a competition created by and for women that raises money to fight breast cancer. Bartenders from all over New England duke it out round-robin style to see who can make the best cocktail from a list of 50 classics, and who can do it fastest.
Sarah Jackson, a bartender at Hunt & Alpine, took first place and will now advance to the May 3 finals in Chicago. I'm happy to report that second place also went to a Portland bartender, LyAnna Sanabria from Chaval. (I'm told that Jackson and Sanabria were only five seconds apart.) Cheers to you, ladies!
Coffee and Coronavirus
Just before Earth Day last year, Tandem Coffee Roasters started charging 25 cents for single-use cups, as a way to encourage customers to bring in re-usable mugs when they wanted a cup of coffee. (At the same time, they lowered the price of a cup of coffee by a quarter.) Their "Give Up the Cup" initiative attracted the attention of other local businesses, with places like Belleville, Little Woodfords and Rose Foods planning to launch their own programs in April. Even a cafe in Massachusetts signed on, and the ultimate goal is to take the idea national, according to the group's spokesperson, Georgina Rose.
But the concern over coronavirus has temporarily postponed those efforts, as waste reduction takes a back seat to public health concerns. Last week, Coffee By Design announced that it was switching to disposable cups and plates until further notice. Now the group of local cafes looking to expand Tandem's policy has decided to pause the program until the situation with the virus is more clear. Likewise, Chris Deutsch, owner of Belleville, a bakery on Portland's East End, said the bakery "will most likely be using disposables only for the foreseeable future."
Sam Sifton live
You can still buy tickets to see Sam Sifton, the New York Times food editor, a cookbook author, the founder of NYT Cooking - and a summer resident of Maine - interviewed before a live audience at the State Theater in Portland. Sifton's talk, part of the Portland Press Herald's Maine Voices Live series, is on Monday. Tickets cost $10 for subscribers and $20 for non-subscribers. Seating is general admission, and the event starts at 7 p.m.
Sifton has spent summers on Bailey and Ragged Islands in Casco Bay since childhood. He will be interviewed by Kate Simmons Tillotson, director of strategic partnerships at Masthead Maine, who once worked as a chef on charter yachts and credits Sifton with helping her sharpen her skills. They'll talk about how cooking can change lives.
Nominate a green hero
Over the five-year life of the Press Herald's annual Source awards, I've found it enlightening to learn about efforts in Maine to promote environmentally friendly practices in an array of fields, from agriculture to education to all kinds of businesses - even prisons. In that time, we've had a few nominees - and winners - from the food-and-beverage arena, but if you ask me, not nearly enough of them. I see plenty of chefs, farmers, suppliers, restaurants and breweries that have instituted green practices, but they seldom nominate themselves or their peers for a Source award. (Two exceptions come to mind: Luke Truman, a leader of Allagash Brewing Co.'s sustainability effort; and the team at Rosemont Markets.) So I'm asking you to put your hand in the game and nominate worthy Mainers for our 2020 awards. You have until April 10; winners will be announced May 24; and we'll celebrate on June 10 at Maine Audubon's Gilsland Farm.
To nominate, go to pressherald.com/2020/03/08/source-awards-nominations-are-open/
Ocean diet regime
Are you interested in edible seaweed or the benefits of farmed versus wild-caught seafood? Consider attending the Maine Nutrition Council's annual meeting, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 8 at the Atlantic Oceanside Hotel & Event Center in Bar Harbor. This year's theme: Nutrition from the Sea. The keynote speaker will be Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. Chef Barton Seaver of Freeport, who has written several seafood cookbooks, is also on the agenda. Find tickets and a full schedule on eventbrite.com.

A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY A LOT OF HIGH-MINDED PEOPLE ARE ALL TOO WILLING TO COMPROMISE THEIR SUPPOSED PRINCIPLES

Texto completo: As we approach the Pennsylvania primary, the Democratic Party is having an identity crisis.
It dates back to 2016, when Bernie Sanders nearly dethroned Hillary Clinton for the party's presidential nomination.
Now, the same division is resurfacing again as the Democratic establishment rallies around another party insider who vows to maintain the established order.
As former Vice President Joe Biden told a room of Wall Street donors back in June, "nothing would fundamentally change" if he's elected. "No one's standard of living will change."
That might be good news for Wall Street and the 66 billionaire donors contributing to Mr. Biden's campaign, but it's not good news for the 78% of American workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, or the 61 million American households who can't afford basics like food and rent. Presumably they could use a change in their standard of living.
But that's not Mr. Biden's fight. He's battling for the sake of business as usual.
By contrast, Mr. Sanders is fighting to make sure every American has economic security, and he's doing it by taking on the corporate interests that control our economy and political system.
This presents the Democratic Party with a clear choice: Is it going to be the party of the rich or the party of the working class?
For years, the Democratic Party has pretended to be the party of the working class, while actually functioning as the party of the rich. When it comes to key economic issues - trade, health care, housing, education, Social Security, minimum wage, workers' rights - Democratic insiders like Mr. Biden have proved just as likely to cozy up to the rich and powerful as Republicans.
It's no wonder, then, that Mr. Biden is the preferred establishment candidate.
Much like President Donald Trump, Mr. Biden has branded himself a "blue-collar" guy. But also like Mr. Trump - who's been more effective giving billionaires tax breaks than creating living-wage jobs - Mr. Biden has repeatedly sold out the working class.
As a U.S. senator, Mr. Biden called for cuts to Medicare and Social Security, voted for the Iraq War, supported NAFTA and other "free" trade deals, prioritized corporate rights over consumer rights, passed bankruptcy bills that made it harder for Americans to reduce their debts, supported crime bills that ramped up mass incarceration - all while collecting millions in financial contributions from Wall Street and union-busting law firms.
Of course, mainstream Democrats don't want to talk about this. They prefer to promote Mr. Biden as someone other than he is - somebody who's merely "electable."
But that tells you all you need to know about the Democratic establishment: Their role is diminishing expectations.
And their message is woefully shortsighted: We can make everything better by simply getting rid of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Sanders has a different message: The system is corrupt. Billionaires are taking everything. Health care is a human right. Climate change requires strong action. Everyone should make a living wage. Nothing will change unless working people come together and fight this unjust system. Power belongs with them.
It's a message that resonates with voters, and it's one reason why Mr. Sanders consistently beats Mr. Trump in the polls, even when he's called a "socialist."
It's also why Mr. Trump himself was afraid that Ms. Clinton would pick Mr. Sanders as her running mate back in 2016. As he told his inner circle at a private dinner in 2018, "[Sanders] is the only one I didn't want her to pick."
What's telling about the Democratic Party is that it doesn't want to pick Mr. Sanders either. Party leaders tell us that he's too "radical," his politics too "divisive." They prefer Mr. Sanders to play nice and relax his core principles for the sake of party "unity."
But here's the thing: If you actually have principles, nothing should push you to change them.
That's what politics is about; it's about fighting for your principles. And that process is inherently divisive. You have to pick a side.
You're either against inequality, or you find ways to justify it.
You either fight to change the established order, or you find your place in it.
You either commit to the "radical" belief that human beings should have health care, housing and a livable planet, or you find ways to compromise.
What this election has made abundantly clear is that a lot of high-minded people who profess to have principles are all too willing to compromise them. And a lot of these people belong to the Democratic Party.

Texto completo: The 1980s series "Amazing Stories" has been reimagined on Apple TV Plus. And new episodes of David Chang's "Ugly Delicious" are on Netflix.
What's Streaming
AMAZING STORIES Stream on Apple TV Plus. A smartphone-obsessed man gets more than he swiped for in this new anthology series, which is based on a 1980s sci-fi show created by Steven Spielberg. The first episode stars Dylan O'Brien as a man who is unwittingly transported from 2019 to the early 20th century through supernatural means. He makes the best of it, finding unlikely love in a rebellious local played by Victoria Pedretti.
ORLANDO (1993) Stream on Criterion Channel; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. For a different kind of time-bending story, see Sally Potter's loose adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel "Orlando." Like the book, the film distorts both time period and gender; it stars Tilda Swinton as its title character, who begins the story as a 17th-century English nobleman and ends it as a late 20th-century author and mother. Potter "takes a huge, audacious and necessary leap away from the page," Caryn James wrote in her review for The New York Times. "The film distills Woolf's rich literary manner into sumptuous backdrops and visual styles that change with the centuries, suggesting a pageant of art history from Renaissance chiaroscuro to misty Romanticism and beyond."
UGLY DELICIOUS Stream on Netflix. The chef and restaurateur David Chang cooks Indian food with Padma Lakshmi, gets a lesson in "modernist cuisine" from the tech executive turned cookbook author Nathan Myhrvold and eats at an Outback Steakhouse in the second season of "Ugly Delicious." Like the first season, the new episodes look at foods in their larger cultural contexts. (In his review of the first season for The Times, Mike Hale described the show as "an extended television essay, in the form of free-associative, globe-trotting conversations about food and culture.") Season 2 opens with an episode built around food for children, with notable chefs discussing how to cook for kids, and how they balance their professional lives with parenting.
What's on TV
JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 (2017) 5:30 p.m. and 10:05 p.m. on USA Network. Here's a moment from this second entry of the "John Wick" series: Despite having just been struck by a four-door sedan, the former hit man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) manages to dodge about a dozen gunshots. He then vaults over the hood of a Mercedes and tackles a beefy bodyguard played by the rapper Common. The two punch and kick at each other, then tumble down a dingy Roman staircase. And that's not even the end of the fight. The plot of the second "John Wick" movie "matters only inasmuch as it allows the returning director, Chad Stahelski, to stage his spectacular fight sequences in various stunning Roman locations," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times, "where they unfold with an almost erotic brutality." Such scenes have proven to be a potent force at the box office: The series has grown more popular with each entry.

Why Reporters Interview the Jury

Texto completo: Journalists for The Times spent a week reaching out to jurors in the Harvey Weinstein case to understand how they arrived at the verdict in the film producer's trial for sexual assault.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Just before 1 p.m. on a Monday in late February, several jurors who convicted the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein of rape made a quick dash from a side exit of a Manhattan courthouse to an open white van parked outside.
Squeezed behind police barricades, reporters called out questions: "Can you walk us through deliberations?" "What was it like in there?" "How did it affect you personally?"
Journalists often try to interview jurors after a verdict in a high-profile case because they can provide unique insight into the decision.
"Jury deliberations are this wonderful part of our democracy that are critical to the rule of law, and yet they happen in secret and they're not recorded," explained Jim McKinley, an editor at The New York Times who oversees court coverage for the Metro desk.
Figuring out what happened in that room, he explained, "that's the biggest part of the story."
In addition to rape, Mr. Weinstein was convicted of a criminal sexual act but acquitted on three other counts, including the two most serious charges of being a sexual predator. Hearing from jurors could lead to a better understanding of not only those decisions but of the broader legal implications of how society views sexual assault and harassment. Mr. Weinstein is scheduled to be sentenced today and faces up to 29 years in jail.
"This is a case that focused on issues of power and consent," said Jan Ransom, a reporter who covers criminal justice for the Metro desk and reported on the trial daily.
"Their verdict changed the landscape. People around the world wanted to know why and how they came to a mixed verdict," she said.
At least 17 reporters and editors were directly involved with the coverage of the trial. Alan Feuer, another Metro reporter, worked closely with Ms. Ransom. Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the reporters who broke the story about allegations against Mr. Weinstein, wrote articles examining the larger repercussions of the case.
Days before the verdict, Mr. McKinley gave reporters various assignments. The goal was to get in touch with the jurors to reconstruct their mind-set during deliberations. Of course, it's not always possible to reach jurors. But when they do speak with the press, they can sometimes reveal improprieties in jury behavior.
After the all-guilty verdict in the trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the drug kingpin known as El Chapo, who had led one of the most powerful cartels in Mexico, one juror called a reporter from Vice News.
"It was the first -- and only -- glimpse of their private deliberations," recalled Mr. Feuer who covered the trial daily. When jurors speak, he said, it "can and often does help build credibility for the jury system when they step out of the shadows and explain themselves."
The juror said they had broken the rules by following news coverage throughout the trial and lying to the judge about it. Mr. Guzmán's attorneys asked, unsuccessfully, for the judge to consider a retrial.
After the trial for the murder of Etan Patz, a 6-year-old listed as missing for decades, ended with a hung jury in the spring of 2015, one juror said he didn't feel the evidence against Pedro Hernandez was strong enough. The store clerk had years earlier confessed to strangling the boy and throwing his body in the garbage in 1979.
As prosecutors prepared a second trial, former jurors met with them, highlighting the evidence they found most damning.
"We were desperate for it to go the right way," Jennifer O'Connor, a juror in the first trial recalled after the eventual guilty verdict in 2017.
In Mr. Weinstein's case, few jurors initially spoke to reporters. I worked as what is known as a stringer, a type of freelance reporter. Following the verdict, my role was to gather color, or descriptions of the scene, from the courthouse and contact and interview jurors at their homes.
I went to Manhattan's East Village neighborhood. For 12 hours, I knocked on the doors of three jurors, left notes with door attendants, ate at least one bag of salt and vinegar potato chips and waited in the lobby of another juror's building -- to no effect.
Another reporter, Nicole Hong, reached one juror by text. He wanted a few days to process the trial.
Laura Dimon, another stringer, spent five days trying to reach one juror. She went to three possible addresses for the person in Manhattan, left one handwritten message and sent three emails, among her attempts. Then, while walking her dog, she received a call from an unknown number. It was the juror, ready to talk.
"It's a good reminder that old school, hit-the-pavement, knock-on-doors journalism is alive and well," she said.
Reporters eventually reached three jurors who agreed to speak anonymously about what had happened in the closed jury room. Those interviews offered a revealing look at the deliberations and showed a jury that took its responsibility seriously.
"They largely had a civil discussion," Ms. Ransom said. "They were able to put away what one called 'the noise' of the 'movement' outside the courtroom to focus on the evidence from each woman and what they believed really happened."

Texto completo: One reader urges Democrats to pay attention to Bernie Sanders's cohort, while another worries about a "Bernie or bust" mentality. Also: Woody Allen's autobiography; the caste system in America.
To the Editor:
Re "Seeing Sanders as the Only Escape in a Sea of Debt" (front page, March 8):
I am heartened to finally see some coverage of committed Bernie Sanders voters instead of the usual "he's a socialist; he's a radical; he can't say how he will pay for his pie-in-the-sky ideas." This article illuminates how Bernie's ideas resonate so deeply for a cohort of often (but not always) young people who suffer the effects of a system that does not work for them.
This Bernie group is significant in number and feels strongly that they and their candidate are not just disregarded but indeed sabotaged by the Democratic establishment. If Democrats don't hear and heed the message of this large cohort, they cannot win in November.

To the Editor:
Brian Michelz, the Bernie Sanders supporter you profile, had me until the last paragraphs, when he said he would not vote for Joe Biden and might even vote for President Trump should Bernie Sanders not get the nomination. He said his life wouldn't change under a Biden presidency, so what's the point?
Seriously? You can't see the point in having a president who believes in expanding health care, banning assault weapons and raising the minimum wage? You can't see the point in having someone in the White House who will make fighting climate change a top priority?
As Sarah Silverman said in 2016: "To the Bernie or bust people, you're being ridiculous."

Hachette Should Publish Woody Allen's Book
To the Editor:
Re "Hachette Won't Publish Woody Allen's Book" (The Digest, Business Day, March 7):
My father, Saxe Commins, was editor in chief of Random House for many years. He worked with many authors, some of whom had opinions with which he violently disagreed. I think particularly of Bishop Fulton J. Sheen and the poet Ezra Pound.
Nevertheless, he encouraged Random House to publish their writings. Censorship is anathema to democracy.
For that reason, I am horrified that Hachette has rejected Woody Allen's autobiography. The editors should not listen to a vindictive son or politically correct employees. They should let the reader form his or her own opinion about Mr. Allen by publishing the book.

Re "Is America on the Way to a Caste System?" (Sunday Business, March 1):
My dad was a butler in Newport, R.I. To help pay for college, my sisters and I put on black dresses with white aprons and worked private dinner parties during the summer social season. I never let my friends see me in that servant dress. It felt anachronistic and weird, the overdue end of an era.
Now I'm a few years from retirement from a professional career, and I'm worried. Will I be able to afford housing? Huge new estates are going up, more luxurious than the ones of my childhood. And I'm thinking: Do I still have that black dress?

Sanders Spreads Blame for His Falling Behind

Texto completo: As Bernie Sanders has seen his fortunes slide, he has cited a number of factors that portray him as an aggrieved outsider.
ST. LOUIS -- To Senator Bernie Sanders, there is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to his recent reversal of fortune. For everyone but him and his campaign.
The "corporate media" didn't pay attention to his agenda.
The Democratic Party establishment aligned to block him from winning its presidential nomination.
And the young voters he counted on to power his campaign didn't come through for him.
"Let me tell you the bad news, to be honest with you, young people vote at much lower rates than older people," the Vermont senator told a St. Louis crowd of mostly young people Monday morning. "All right? That is the facts. I hope all of the old people vote, that's great, but I want young people to vote at the same rates."
Political candidates are not generally given to self-criticism. And as Mr. Sanders has seen his fortunes slide after a 30-point South Carolina loss to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., followed by Mr. Biden's unexpected strength across Super Tuesday and victories in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday night, he has cited a number of factors that portray him as an aggrieved outsider.
It comes at a time of particular weakness for Mr. Sanders. Through Tuesday's voting, his theory of the election has not proven true. The surge of new voters in the Democratic primaries has featured mostly older people, moderate suburbanites and African-Americans disinclined to support his campaign.
As Democrats in six states voted Tuesday, Mr. Sanders, his team and his supporters have come up with explanations for his loss of momentum that deflect the responsibility onto others.
So when Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr. Biden, to the Sanders camp it wasn't because they'd won next to no support from black voters and run out of money, it was part of an establishment plot. And Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris were simply joining the effort to block Mr. Sanders when they backed Mr. Biden this week.
"If they thought that Joe Biden was the best choice, maybe they shouldn't have run," Rasheen Aldridge, a Missouri state representative who was a warm-up speaker for Mr. Sanders in St. Louis, said in an interview. "Some of these candidates -- Kamala has been out for a long time, Booker has been out for a while. It's all very kind of fishy how things are working out."
The 2016 campaign established Mr. Sanders as the Democratic Party's foremost practitioner of grievance politics. Like Donald Trump in that year's Republican primary, Mr. Sanders tapped into populist anger to upend a major political party.
Then, Mr. Sanders denounced Democratic National Committee debate rules he said favored Hillary Clinton's campaign and a superdelegate system he argued empowered party insiders over grass-roots voters. His vociferous, public complaints led the D.N.C. to enact substantive changes to the rules for caucus states and to strip first-ballot voting power from superdelegates at the party's convention.
Now the Sanders campaign says the policies he's pitching as a democratic socialist -- "Medicare for all," free public college tuition and other proposals -- represent an existential threat to powerful operators that have prompted an unusually coordinated effort to block his rise.
"We face a unique uphill battle that other candidates don't because of the agenda that he stands for," a campaign spokesman, Mike Casca, said. "Because of the agenda that he's putting forward, a lot of super wealthy forces are aligned against him."
Yet others close to the Sanders campaign say he didn't expect to find himself trailing Mr. Biden at this point in the race and is trying to save face with his most ardent supporters by blaming others. It's also not bad for fund-raising -- perhaps uniquely among the 2020 candidates, Mr. Sanders does just as well with online contributions after he loses states than when he wins.
The ability to keep raising tons of money can allow Mr. Sanders to prolong his candidacy even if voters keep delivering a verdict more favorable to Mr. Biden.
Mr. Sanders blamed his Super Tuesday performance in part on the "venom" of the "corporate media." Last month, his campaign manager said the liberal cable network MSNBC had been unfair to Mr. Sanders, while Mr. Sanders said supporters in California "may find it impossible" to vote for him because of the state's mail ballot rules.
When he went on MSNBC to discuss the Super Tuesday results with Rachel Maddow, Mr. Sanders said that some polling shows he's beating Mr. Biden among African-Americans but attributed his weak showing among black voters to the fact that "we're running against somebody who has touted his relationship with Barack Obama for eight years."
Even among those ideologically inclined to back Mr. Sanders, he has engendered little sympathy in recent days. Adam Jentleson, a close ally of Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign -- who has not been shy about expressing his own grievances about perceived outside forces that limited her campaign -- said Mr. Sanders does himself little good in arguing others are responsible for his shortcomings.
"Blame-shifting is pointless because nobody swoops in and hands you the nomination; you have to win it," Mr. Jentleson said. "The nominee needs to be the leader of the whole party and Bernie's job was to convince people he could be that."
Though Mr. Sanders's campaign would love to get Ms. Warren's endorsement, he has not publicly made an issue of it, saying she deserves the time to make her own determination. Privately, aides have expressed irritation that she withheld her backing while Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar quickly rallied to Mr. Biden, and many of Mr. Sanders's supporters have publicly denounced her online.
"Imagine if the progressives consolidated last night like the moderates consolidated, who would have won?" Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota wrote on Twitter after Mr. Biden swept 10 of 14 Super Tuesday states. "That's what we should be analyzing. I feel confident a united progressive front would have allowed for us to #BuildTogether and win MN and other states we narrowly lost."
Mr. Sanders on Monday declined to answer a question about when he had last spoken to Ms. Warren.
Mr. Sanders also scoffed at the endorsement of Mr. Biden by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan -- whom Mr. Sanders backed in the 2018 general election after campaigning for her opponent in the primary.
When Ms. Whitmer said Mr. Biden would be the party's best nominee, Mr. Sanders said: "Well, that wasn't her thoughts when I came here to help her get elected, as a matter of fact."
Then on Sunday, Mr. Sanders said on ABC's "This Week" that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar were forced out of the race by party leaders intent on blocking his rise.
"One of the things I was kind of not surprised by was the power of the establishment to force Amy Klobuchar, who had worked so hard, Pete Buttigieg, who had really worked extremely hard as well, out of the race," he said, in a remark that managed to unite aides to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who spent months in deep political conflict with each other.
"What was very clear from the media narrative and what the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and tried to defeat me," he added. "So that's not surprising."
By Monday in St. Louis, that sentiment was evident among Sanders supporters in the audience.
"I'm frustrated that a lot of the candidates in the field endorsed Biden," said Jen McCabe, an information technology saleswoman from Kirkwood, Mo. "I think they gave into D.N.C. and super PAC pressure. We need to get that money out of the primary."
Mr. Sanders made his final pitch to Michigan voters on Fox News Monday night, hardly the go-to news source for Democratic primary voters. During a town hall event in Dearborn, Mich., he blamed the news media in general for negative coverage and cited a New York Times article he didn't like about a trip he made to the Soviet Union to launch a sister city program when he was mayor of Burlington, Vt. "What we need from the media is honesty and respect," he said.
Asked by a voter how he'd get a resistant Congress to enact his slate of progressive proposals, Mr. Sanders said people who believe he can't work with lawmakers to get things done are wrong.
"There's a mythology going out around me that everybody hates me; we heard that from Secretary Clinton that I can't work with anybody," he said. "It's just not accurate."

Indictments Shine a Light on a Sport Indifferent to Its Stars

Texto completo: Indictments charging 27 people, including some of the sport's biggest winners, were just as startling in what they revealed about others in the trade.
Jorge Navarro was the Juice Man -- or at least that is what gamblers on the rail and his rival horse trainers whispered about him. He had a knack (or potion) for making slow horses fast.
In August 2017, before he became a target of federal prosecutors, Navarro embraced his nickname. He was caught on an infamous video posted online celebrating a victory giddily and profanely with one of the owners whose horses he trained.
"Adios, amigos. Adios, amigos," said the owner, Randal Gindi. "The Juice Man!"
"Is that a Navarro? Is that a Navarro?" the trainer responded. "Is that a Navarro at 2-1? That's the way we do it."
"That's the juice," Gindi said.
Only Gindi knows if he was being literal that day, but prosecutors now contend Navarro was indeed up to no good. On Monday, they rounded up Navarro and 26 other trainers, veterinarians and drug distributors and charged them, in a series of indictments, with doping racehorses and cheating the public.
The schemes revealed in those four indictments were startling, and showed just how deeply a drug culture had taken hold in a sport whose participants claim to love their horses, how complicit horse owners were in pursuit of big purses, and how cowed the trainers were even as they groused about their crooked competitors but were afraid to hold them accountable.
The indictments also revealed how indifferent regulators and racetrack operators like Churchill Downs were to the stars of the show: the thoroughbreds. Drug rules and strict punishments were in place; they just were not enforced.
Navarro and Jason Servis -- who trained Maximum Security, the winner of the Kentucky Derby for 22 minutes until he was disqualified for interference -- are caught on wire taps talking about joint blockers called "red acid" and blood builders named "monkey."
When one unindicted and unidentified owner worried about the fourth consecutive poor performance by his horse, he was heard asking, "Is this horse jacked out?"
"Everything," Navarro assured him. "He gets everything."
Navarro's horses have earned more than $ 37 million since 2008. Servis finished in the top 10 in earnings last year and, last month, Maximum Security won $ 10 million at the Saudi Cup in Riyadh, the world's richest horse race.
He did so with the help of a drug regimen, according to the authorities.
The world of horse racing, of course, declared itself shocked at the news.
"Jason Servis, a trainer we have used for 5 years, was indicted on multiple charges regarding using an illegal substance in horses," the owner of Maximum Security, Gary West, said in a statement Monday. "This news is extremely disturbing and disappointing."
While Servis fights the charges, West, who tried to get his colt's Derby victory restored through the courts, will move Maximum Security to the barn of Bob Baffert.
Baffert is not a part of this indictment but last year, The New York Times reported that Justify, the 2018 Triple Crown winner that he trained, failed a drug test shortly before the Kentucky Derby. The rule on the books at the time required that Justify be disqualified, forfeiting both the prize money he had won and his entry into the Derby, the first Triple Crown race.
California racing officials spent four months investigating the failed test, long enough for Justify to not only compete in the Derby, but also win it, along with the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. In August, after Justify's breeding rights had been sold for $ 60 million, the California board -- whose chairman at the time, Chuck Winner, had employed Baffert as his trainer -- disposed of the inquiry altogether during a rare closed-door session.
They ruled that Justify's positive test for the illegal drug scopolamine was the result of "environmental contamination," not intentional doping. Baffert has denied any wrongdoing but the quantity of the drug found in Justify suggested that it was not the result of feed or bedding contamination but intended to enhance performance, according to Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018.
California regulators concede that no other horse at Santa Anita tested for a level of scopolamine as high as Justify's. In fact, no other horse came up positive. They said a handful had showed trace amounts, but not enough to even notify their trainers.
On Tuesday, that same group released a 77-page report on 23 horses that died at Santa Anita Park last year, in a spike that has brought California racing to its knees. After losing more than 400 horses to racetracks in Arkansas and New York, Santa Anita now runs only three days a week. It has small fields and diminished betting.
How did those horses die?
Twenty-one had "pre-existing pathology at the site of their fatal injury," the report noted, and 11 had received injections of corticosteroids to the joints. Unseasonably cold and wet weather contributed to the deaths of nearly 40 percent of the horses, the report said.
No illegal medications were found in any of them.
Surprising? Not really, if you believe federal prosecutors. As Maximum Security won eight of 10 races and nearly $ 12 million in purses while passing drug test after drug test, they said, veterinarians falsified records and backstretch pushers promised and delivered cutting-edge chemistry.
One woman prosecutors described as a supplier, Sarah Izhaki, sold something called Devil's Breath to an undercover agent. "The Devil was something very new," she promised. "You put it in a horse, you can use coke: it will come back negative."
It was a tempting sales pitch. In horse racing, big purses are matched by big egos, a dynamic that sometimes encourages situational ethics. It is something one of the defendants, the veterinarian Seth Fishman, reminded a prospective customer on a recorded phone call.
"But it isn't doping, yeah?" the customer asked about Fishman's drugs.
"Don't kid yourself," Fishman said. "If you are giving something to a horse to make it better, that's doping. Whether or not that's testable, that's a different story."

Texto completo: The growing epidemic is generating heavy news coverage, but companies are nervous about being associated with the outbreak.
The CNN show "Erin Burnett OutFront" spent much of its time on Friday focused, like many other news programs, on the coronavirus outbreak and the thousands of people isolated on the Grand Princess cruise ship near California.
During the commercial break, one spot stood out: an upbeat ad for Norwegian Cruise Line, a competitor.
It was one of many awkward ad placements as companies try to reach skittish customers while protecting their brands from becoming collateral damage in the growing coronavirus outbreak.
Norwegian, which declined to comment, has paid nearly $ 10 million for digital ads so far this year on Facebook, Wayfair, Expedia and other sites, compared with $ 2.4 million at the same time last year. Competitors like Carnival Cruise Line, Disney Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Viking Cruises have also increased their spending on advertising, according to the advertising analytics platform Pathmatics.
In the past two weeks, nearly $ 6 million in television ads from cruise companies have appeared during NBC's Super Tuesday coverage, CBS's debate programming, and shows like "The Voice" and "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," according to the measurement company iSpot.TV.
Many of the ads have ended up alongside unflattering reports about cruises, positioned next to stories about quarantines and government warnings. CNN is working with cruise lines like Norwegian and other travel companies to move commercials to future times. But other spots were placed in milliseconds through an automated bidding process, created to help companies better target consumers.
The coronavirus outbreak has tested the appeal of placing ads by machine. This weekend, several digital publications found their articles dotted with ads for face masks, which the surgeon general has urged the public to stop buying. Disneyland ads appeared on Twitter next to news alerts about neighboring Los Angeles County's declaring a local health emergency. The delayed James Bond film "No Time to Die" was promoted near headlines about the coronavirus death toll.
"It used to be pretty easy -- broadcasters had a few ad slots, they had a direct relationship with the advertisers, and they knew which ones they needed to be hyper vigilant about," said Mike Zaneis, a co-founder of the training organization Brand Safety Institute. "Now, the scale creates a huge challenge: There might be 10,000 stories a day about coronavirus, there may be 100 different advertisers serving ads, and they're different based on who's watching and what platform it's on."
Companies are nervous about being associated with news about the outbreak. OpenSlate, an analytics firm that helps advertisers assess online video content, said nearly 500 out of 109,000 videos related to coronavirus on YouTube and Facebook promoted misinformation.
Many companies are blocking their ads from appearing next to sensitive terms linked to the coronavirus, creating keyword blacklists similar to the ones used to avoid stories about airplane crashes, mass shootings and impeachment proceedings. "Coronavirus" was the second-most-blocked term online last month behind "Trump," according to the technology company Integral Ad Science.
In an increasingly divisive environment, some companies regularly block thousands of keywords in an effort to sidestep backlash. But often, experts said, the caution leaves no room for gray areas and denies publishers much-needed advertising revenue. A cruise company might want to sidestep coronavirus content, but an automaker has less reason to keep its ads away from valuable consumers on reputable platforms.
"The use of the algorithm seems to be kind of a crutch," said Ari Paparo, the chief executive of the ad tech start-up Beeswax, who recently pointed out valuable unfilled ad space on The New York Times's website on Twitter.
The anxiety surrounding the outbreak is creating openings for shady marketers, said Joshua Lowcock, the chief digital and global brand safety officer for the marketing and media agency UM. Coronavirus is generating heavy news coverage, creating more space for ads. But as larger companies steer clear, the supply is being filled with bids from what he calls "profiteering opportunists."
"Because there isn't demand from legitimate advertisers, you've got unscrupulous advertisers stepping into that void," he said.
As a result, dubious ads that normally cannot afford to land near high-quality content are squeezing into prime positions, taking advantage of the trust built up on those sites, Mr. Zaneis said.
"The slimy folks on the internet will always find the little cracks and crevices and ooze in there," he said.
Facebook said on Friday that it planned to ban ads and commercial listings for medical face masks. Amazon, Google, Twitter and other tech companies said they were also trying to redirect users looking for coronavirus information to government health agencies and other authorities.
On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to seven companies, including a show run by the televangelist and convicted fraudster Jim Bakker, accused of marketing products like teas, essential oils and colloidal silver as protection against coronavirus. The F.T.C. also said scammers were using websites, emails, texts and social media posts to promote bogus coronavirus products.
"There already is a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus," Joseph J. Simons, the chairman of the F.T.C., said in a statement. "What we don't need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims."
As coronavirus continues to spread, companies will have to figure out whether to advertise, and where. Princess Cruises said in a statement that, after enhancing its health screening protocols and putting into place a more flexible cancellation policy, it intended to continue promoting cruises.
Publishers are girding for more uncomfortable ad placements.
"The platforms are attempting to respond," Mr. Lowcock said. "But by and large, the industry's ill prepared to deal with this type of event."

Walmart promises two weeks of pay for isolated workers
Walmart, the nation's largest employer, said it was taking steps to ensure that its 1.4 million workers would continue to be paid if they contracted the virus or were subject to a quarantine.
The company said employees forced into a mandatory quarantine would receive up to two weeks of pay and their absence would not be counted against their attendance record. Additionally, any U.S. worker with the virus who was unable to return to work would be paid up to 26 weeks.
OIL
Saudi Aramco vows to increase oil production significantly
Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's national oil company, said on Tuesday that it would produce 12.3 million barrels a day of crude oil in April, a significant jump from its average of 9.7 million barrels a day.
Although it is not clear how much of this oil would come from storage, the company is likely to sharply increase production. Saudi officials have said that they need to sell more oil to compensate for lower prices, and Aramco is offering deep discounts on its oil to win over buyers.
RETAIL
A toymaker explains how the outbreak will hurt
As the coronavirus epidemic spreads around the world, companies are less worried about factory shutdowns among their Chinese suppliers and more about a lack of U.S. customers.
Some have already been forced to take action. Jay Foreman, the chief executive of toy company Basic Fun, said the coronavirus crisis had forced him to lay off 18 of the company's 175 workers on Friday -- 10 in the United States, six in Hong Kong and two in Europe.
"China is slowly starting to open up, so we're getting shipments," said Mr. Foreman, whose company makes Tonka Trucks, Lite-Brite and Tinkertoy. "But now what I'm worried about is a demand scenario in the United States, where people decide the only thing they're buying is hand sanitizer and Wet Wipes and Campbell's Soup."
AIRLINES
Flights to Italy are suspended by many, not all, carriers
Several airlines on Tuesday announced the temporary suspension of all flights to and from Italy, a day after the country announced a nationwide lockdown.
Spanish authorities barred all airlines from Spain, including Iberia and Vueling, from operating either inbound or outbound Italian flights, while British Airways announced the immediate suspension of flights until April 4 and Ryanair said it would suspend all of its domestic flights in Italy and international flights to Italy.
Alitalia, Italy's flagship carrier, said it would continue services but gave passengers the option to rebook or reroute their flight free of charge.

Texto completo: Unsealed court papers also reveal he wrote "Jen Aniston should be killed."
In the days following news reports about how he used his power to sexually assault women, Harvey Weinstein made a desperate plea for help in emails to two dozen influential people, including the billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Jeff Bezos.
That detail was revealed on Monday in a trove of previously sealed court documents that offered a look into the days and weeks that followed the Hollywood mogul's downfall.
Mr. Weinstein and his public relations team scrambled to craft a response to the allegations in October 2017. He promised to enter into a counseling program for sex addicts, and he did. "Allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance," he wrote in one email.
A month later, in a scathing letter, his brother, Bob Weinstein, called Mr. Weinstein a sexual predator and an abusive person who belonged in "hell."
A few days after that, responding to a question from a gossip columnist, Mr. Weinstein alluded to having been sexually abused as a child. Then, a few weeks later, in a self-pitying, unpublished statement, he said he was suicidal.
The emails and other communications provided insight into the effort by Mr. Weinstein and his representatives to portray him as a troubled man who badly wanted to right his wrongs. They also showed his deeply fractured relationship with his brother and his attempts to silence those who sought to expose him.
In one email, Mr. Weinstein suggested that the actress Jennifer Aniston -- who he believed had complained about him -- should be killed. And even as he endeavored to repair his reputation and excuse his behavior, his communications on the matter were often self-centered, unapologetic, and at times, patronizing.
Two weeks ago a jury in Manhattan found Mr. Weinstein, 67, guilty of third-degree rape and of first-degree criminal sexual act. The newly released records were not presented to the jury as evidence at trial.
Mr. Weinstein's spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, declined to comment. Mr. Weinstein faces up to 29 years in prison when he is sentenced on Wednesday.
Prosecutors have asked Justice James M. Burke to consider 36 "prior bad acts" when determining his sentence. Those include alleged sexual assaults against women spanning four decades for which Mr. Weinstein was never criminally charged. The earliest allegation comes from woman who says he raped her on a business trip in 1978.
But Mr. Weinstein's lawyers have argued in court papers that the allegations were never proven and should not be used to determine his punishment.
They also stressed that the producer was acquitted of the most serious charges against him: one count of first-degree rape, which requires the use of force, and two counts of predatory sexual assault, which requires the state to prove he committed serious sexual felonies against at least two women.
The defense lawyers have requested a prison term of five years, the least the law allows. Noting that the life expectancy of someone Mr. Weinstein's age is about 12 years, they argued a longer term than five years "is likely to constitute a de facto life sentence."
In all, six women testified about their sexual encounters with Mr. Weinstein during his trial in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The jury found Mr. Weinstein guilty of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant, Miriam Haley, in his Manhattan loft in 2006, and of raping an aspiring actress, Jessica Mann, at a Midtown Manhattan hotel in 2013.
On the advice of his lawyers, Mr. Weinstein did not testify. The newly released court documents provided one possible reason that he opted not to take the stand. Manhattan prosecutors were prepared to call 11 more "prior bad act" witnesses to testify if he had.
Exposés published in The New York Times and The New Yorker in October 2017 opened the floodgates. Since then, more than 90 women, many of them actresses, have come forward with allegations that he sexually harassed or assaulted them.
The unsealed court documents show that within days of the appearance of the news reports, board members at the Weinstein Company were looking to fire Mr. Weinstein.
Mr. Weinstein quickly mounted a last-ditch effort to save himself. He emailed a group of wealthy friends, including Ronald Meyer, the vice chairman of NBC Universal; Tim Cook, the executive of Apple Inc.; and Theodore A. Sarandos Jr., the chief content officer of Netflix.
He also contacted Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and Democratic presidential candidate, and Mr. Bezos, who founded Amazon. Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said, "Mike didn't reply to the email." Mr. Bezos did not respond to an email requesting comment on Tuesday.
"My board is thinking of firing me," Mr. Weinstein wrote. "All I'm asking for is, let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counseling whether it be in a facility or somewhere else, and allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance."
He also sought advice from Anita Dunn, a veteran Democratic operative who is now the top adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination.
"You should accept your fate graciously, and not seek to deny or discredit those who your behaviour has affected," she wrote him, using British spelling.
But when Mr. Weinstein heard -- incorrectly it turned out -- that Ms. Aniston, the actress best known for her role on the television show "Friends," had accused him of groping her, he wrote to his representative, "Jen Aniston should be killed."
Ms. Aniston's publicist Stephen Huvane denied that Mr. Weinstein ever assaulted her.
"He never got close enough to her to touch her," Mr. Huvane said in a statement this week. "She has never been alone with him. We have no idea about the email, since it wasn't sent to us, nor do we have any comment to make on it."
The unsealed court papers said that prosecutors spoke to more than 100 people who knew or worked with Mr. Weinstein during their investigation.
Many described "bad acts" and boorish behavior, the court papers said. Mr. Weinstein, for instance, used a friend's Social Security number without his permission to apply for and receive a passport in 1998, the papers said.
Several employees told prosecutors horror stories, the papers said. One said Mr. Weinstein demanded a massage in London in the 1990s, then grabbed her breasts.
Another said the producer ordered him out of a car and abandoned him while on a business trip in 2013, the papers said. A third said he was forced to procure prostitutes for Mr. Weinstein in 2007.
In late 2017, as the allegations continued to pile up, A.J. Benza, a former New York Daily News gossip columnist, asked Mr. Weinstein if he had ever been a victim of sexual abuse himself, court documents said.
"Are you sure a rabbi or someone didn't do things to you when you were a little boy?" Mr. Benza asked Mr. Weinstein, according to court documents. Mr. Benza added, "It takes a monster to make a monster."
Mr. Weinstein, without providing details, responded in a text message, the documents showed, writing "It is a incident when I was a very young boy." He then urged Mr. Benza to delete the message.
That same month, while in a rehabilitation clinic for his sex addiction, Mr. Weinstein called the entertainment gossip website, TMZ, according to an email from his brother.
Bob Weinstein was enraged and condemned his brother, Harvey, in an email, writing that he seemed incapable of understanding the pain he had caused over the years. Bob Weinstein also expressed disbelief that his brother "had consensual sex with all those poor victimized women."
"U deserve a lifetime achievement award for the sheer savagery and immorality and inhumanness, for the acts u have perpetrated," Bob Weinstein wrote, misspelling you and inhumaneness.
"I pray there is a real hell," he wrote. "That's where u belong."

Texto completo: Readers discuss a writer's frustration with the health care system, offer advice on hand-to-face contact and cite Edgar Allan Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death."
To the Editor:
As a physician, I am frustrated by Robin Shulman's March 10 Op-Ed, "My Ordeal to Get a Coronavirus Test." The purpose of her piece was to highlight the ineffectiveness of the health care system. In my opinion, it demonstrated quite the opposite.
The patient was evaluated by multiple physicians and denied testing because she didn't meet the criteria. She repeatedly returned, until she finally was tested and found to be negative. While I'm sure Ms. Shulman was distressed by her symptoms, to a physician they were not very concerning at all. She likely had a common cold. Because of her persistence, valuable resources were wasted.
Every health care resource is precious and must be allocated appropriately. Her physicians were correct to give reassurance and avoid testing. It's unfortunate that her persistence was allowed to trump sound clinical judgment.

To the Editor:
When I was a child we did not have hand sanitizers. So some of us relied on common sense advice from our mothers to avoid getting sick or spreading our germs to others: "Use one hand for the world and the other for yourself."
While some tasks do require the use of both hands, if we could all get into the habit of using only our dominant hands to touch other people and shared surfaces (door handles, banisters, touch pads) and only our nondominant hands to touch ourselves (scratch our itches, blow our noses, rub our eyes), it might help contain the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses transmitted by contact.
Susan Aiello

To the Editor:
Your story about the rich trying to outmaneuver the coronavirus ("Sick? Not if the Rich Can Help It," Sunday Styles, March 8) reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's cautionary tale "The Masque of the Red Death."
Poe describes a horrific pestilence that has wiped out half the population. The rich, however, confident of their privilege, and with the means to support it, quarantine themselves. In their private hide-out, the nobles carouse and celebrate. They carry on until one day a figure appears, dressed as the Red Death -- it is the plague itself, which has infiltrated the reveling crowd, and brings death to the prince and his followers.
We hear about the rich building bunkers against nuclear war and climate change, and now walling themselves off from Covid-19. Let Poe's story be a lesson to the lofty: You can run, but you can't hide.

Texto completo: One reader urges Democrats to pay attention to Bernie Sanders's cohort, while another worries about a "Bernie or bust" mentality.
To the Editor:
Re "Seeing Sanders as the Only Escape in a Sea of Debt" (front page, March 8):
I am heartened to finally see some coverage of committed Bernie Sanders voters instead of the usual "he's a socialist; he's a radical; he can't say how he will pay for his pie-in-the-sky ideas." This article illuminates how Bernie's ideas resonate so deeply for a cohort of often (but not always) young people who suffer the effects of a system that does not work for them.
This Bernie group is significant in number and feels strongly that they and their candidate are not just disregarded but indeed sabotaged by the Democratic establishment. If Democrats don't hear and heed the message of this large cohort, they cannot win in November.

To the Editor:
Brian Michelz, the Bernie Sanders supporter you profile, had me until the last paragraphs, when he said he would not vote for Joe Biden and might even vote for President Trump should Bernie Sanders not get the nomination. He said his life wouldn't change under a Biden presidency, so what's the point?
Seriously? You can't see the point in having a president who believes in expanding health care, banning assault weapons and raising the minimum wage? You can't see the point in having someone in the White House who will make fighting climate change a top priority?
As Sarah Silverman said in 2016: "To the Bernie or bust people, you're being ridiculous."

Texto completo: President Trump, in a tweet Tuesday night, expressed his full-throated endorsement of the man running against his former attorney general in a runoff election for the state's primary.
President Trump on Tuesday night endorsed Tommy Tuberville, the former college football coach who won the most votes in last week's Republican primary for the Senate seat from Alabama and is locked in a runoff against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general.
The endorsement came after Mr. Trump agreed to sit on the sidelines during the crowded primary, which had become a show of which candidate displayed more fealty to the president. Mr. Tuberville received the most votes, and polls show him with a comfortable lead heading into the runoff against Mr. Sessions, which is scheduled for March 31.
"Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. "He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment (which is under siege), is strong on Crime and the Border, and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!"
The endorsement had been a possibility since the end of the primary, during which Mr. Trump had agreed to requests from some Republicans to stay on the sidelines. His reward was being able to criticize Mr. Sessions once it was over -- something he did the day after the primary took place.
Mr. Sessions, who formerly held a Senate seat in Alabama, had left that post to join the Trump administration as the president's first attorney general. But Mr. Trump never forgave Mr. Sessions, a campaign surrogate in 2016, for recusing himself from the investigation into whether there was a conspiracy between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.
After publicly humiliating Mr. Sessions for 18 months, Mr. Trump fired him in late 2018.
Mr. Tuberville has had his own bar to clear: He said in a campaign appearance in August 2019 that he was "pissed off" at Mr. Trump over health care for veterans, a video of which has circulated in recent weeks and which Mr. Sessions used in a campaign ad. Since then, Mr. Tuberville has praised Mr. Trump and equated him to a head coach getting insufficient information from assistants.
In a primary campaign ad when he entered the race, Mr. Sessions lavished praise on Mr. Trump and highlighted that he had endorsed the president early in his 2016 presidential campaign.
The runoff winner will face the incumbent, Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, in November. Mr. Jones is seen as one of the most, if not the most, vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, and the race is being closely watched as the party tries to reclaim the majority from the Republicans.

Promising Job Security, Bloomberg Shifts Course

Texto completo: Former campaign workers for Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential bid reacted angrily on Monday to news that they would not work through the November election, as expected.
When the multibillionaire Michael R. Bloomberg hired an army of staff members for his presidential campaign, he lavished them with salaries that were nearly double what other candidates were paying. His campaign also promised something rivals could not match: job security through the general election, even if he dropped out of the race.
But now, less than a week after Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, left the Democratic presidential race -- endorsing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and pledging to put his vast resources behind him -- hundreds of Mr. Bloomberg's field organizers and regional organizing directors around the country are suddenly without jobs, having received emails on Monday that encouraged them to keep their campaign-issued electronics as a sort of severance payment.
In a series of conference calls on Monday, campaign staff members outside certain battleground states learned that their work had ended and that they would be paid through the end of March, according to seven people who were on such calls. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements they had signed with the campaign, from which they were seeking to be released.
"We sincerely appreciate your commitment and dedication over the past few months!" read an email that the workers received, which was reviewed by The New York Times. "As a token of our appreciation, we are offering you the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone."
The email specified the value of those devices -- ranging from $ 1,400 to $ 1,700, depending on the model of the computer -- and noted that employees would be required to pay taxes on those amounts.
The former campaign workers -- at-will employees who said they had been promised employment through November in job interviews -- were asked in a survey to indicate if they wanted to be referred to another presidential campaign, and if they were open to moving to one of six states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
A spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign said in a statement on Monday that the campaign had been clear about its intention to focus on those states as the field of primary candidates narrowed.
"As we've said over the course of the campaign, this election will come down to six battleground states," the statement said. "It's imperative that we invest there with staff and infrastructure. Staff who were working in non-battleground states and would like to learn about future opportunities in the battleground states are being asked to let us know so we can consider them for jobs there."
The former staff members, some of whom said they were consulting employment lawyers, said they had asked to be released from the nondisclosure agreements, calling it unfair to be unable to talk about their work for the campaign as they found themselves unemployed and searching for new jobs. Some people had moved to new states for the campaign, receiving stipends to relocate for what they had expected would be nearly a year.
On Monday, some of the affected staff members turned their organizing efforts inward, seeking to reach senior campaign aides who might have been involved in the decision.
In ramping up operations quickly after Mr. Bloomberg declared his candidacy last November, the campaign used pay as a powerful recruitment tool, assembling a legion of workers across the country and offering unusually high salaries. Field organizers were offered $ 6,000 a month, nearly twice the $ 3,500 that other campaigns paid.
Bloomberg campaign staff members said they were told they had job security, mitigating the risk that typically accompanies such work. Some said they had taken leaves of absence from jobs that they were unable to reclaim until the end of the year. Some field organizers said they had turned down competing, full-time job offers in favor of working on Mr. Bloomberg's bid.
Over the course of his 14-week campaign, Mr. Bloomberg emphasized his commitment to unseating President Trump and promised to support whoever won the Democratic nomination. Last week, days before he exited the race, he specified that he planned to keep his "main field offices" open, regardless of the results on Super Tuesday.
Having won only American Samoa in those primary contests, Mr. Bloomberg dropped out of the race the next day, and his operation set about determining the legally complicated mechanics of how to redeploy his campaign in service of Mr. Biden's.
While nondisclosure agreements are standard on political campaigns -- helping to protect trade secrets like self-research and internal polling -- hush agreements have also been among the issues that dogged Mr. Bloomberg in the Democratic primary race.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who also ended her presidential campaign last week, lashed into Mr. Bloomberg in two Democratic primary debates, criticizing him for comments he had allegedly made about women, and calling on him to release former employees from nondisclosure agreements that they had signed with Bloomberg LP.

Russia Trying to Incite Racial Violence, Experts Say

Texto completo: Russian intelligence services are trying to incite violence by white supremacist groups to sow chaos in the United States, American intelligence officials said.
WASHINGTON -- The Russian government has stepped up efforts to inflame racial tensions in the United States as part of its bid to influence November's presidential election, including trying to incite violence by white supremacist groups and to stoke anger among African-Americans, according to seven American officials briefed on recent intelligence.
Russia's lead intelligence agency, the S.V.R., has apparently gone beyond 2016 methods of interference, when operatives tried to stoke racial animosity by creating fake Black Lives Matter groups and spreading disinformation to depress black voter turnout. Now, Russia is also trying to influence white supremacist groups, the officials said; they gave few details, but one official said federal investigators are examining how at least one neo-Nazi organization with ties to Russia is funded.
Other Russian efforts, which American intelligence agencies have tracked, involve simply prodding white nationalists to more aggressively spread hate messages and amplifying their invective. Russian operatives are also trying to push black extremist groups toward violence, according to multiple officials, though they did not detail how.
Russia's more public influence operations, like state-backed news organizations, have continued to push divisive racial narratives, including stories emphasizing allegations of police abuse in the United States and highlighting racism against African-Americans within the military.
And as social media companies more vigilantly monitor for foreign activity than they did in 2016, Russia has also adjusted its methods to evade detection. Rather than disseminate messages as widely as possible, as in 2016, Russian operatives are using private Facebook groups, posts on the online message board 4chan and closed chat rooms that are more difficult to monitor, according to intelligence officials.
Russia's primary goal, according to several officials briefed on the intelligence who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, is to foster a sense of chaos in the United States, though its motivations are under debate and difficult to decipher in the absence of high-level intelligence sources inside Moscow.
The direct effect of its interference on presidential politics is less clear, though some American officials said that Russia believed that acts of violence could bolster President Trump's re-election bid if he could argue that a response to such an episode demanded continuity and that he represented a law-and-order approach.
The F.B.I. and other intelligence agencies declined to comment on specific Russian activities.
"We see Russia is willing to conduct more brazen and disruptive influence operations because of how it perceives its conflict with the West," David Porter, a top agent on the F.B.I.'s Foreign Influence Task Force, said last month at an election security conference in Washington.
He added, "To put it simply, in this space, Russia wants to watch us tear ourselves apart."
Because Russia is trying to amplify the messaging of existing groups, its interference is difficult for American officials to combat given First Amendment protections for speech. The government does have the legal authority to stop hate speech that explicitly advocates violence, and social media companies continue to take down accounts linked to Russian intelligence or disinformation groups.
Attempts to exacerbate racial divisions are only one strand of Russia's influence operations in 2020; Moscow's intelligence agencies promote a variety of narratives and divisive issues. But perhaps no more difficult issue exists in the United States than racial justice and privilege, and officials expressed worry that amplifying divisions among races could do the most damage to the country's social fabric.
The Russian intelligence services took note of the divisive nature of the 2017 white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., which led to the death of a counterprotester, and concluded that promoting hate groups was the most effective method of sowing discord in the United States, according to American intelligence reports described by the officials.
Some American officials believe that Russia is trying to undermine American democracy and the nation's standing in the world by driving debate to the extremes.
"One of Russia's goals is weakening institutions and the weaponization of race is a way they can do that," said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. "A divided America is a weaker America. When we are unable to solve our challenges together, Russia is more able to flex its power around the world."
American officials are divided about whether Russia is provoking racial division to influence the presidential election. Some officials think the effort is separate from any Kremlin effort to favor Mr. Trump. But others argue that Russian intelligence officials believe their efforts could help turn out more of Mr. Trump's core voters, though their understanding of American electoral politics is unclear.
American officials are also examining ties between Russian intelligence and some white supremacist groups, according to an intelligence official.
The F.B.I. is scrutinizing any ties between Russian intelligence or its proxies and Rinaldo Nazzaro, an American citizen who founded a neo-Nazi group, the Base, according to former American officials. He lives in St. Petersburg, Russia, and is married to a Russian national, according to former government officials. The Guardian first reported his identity.
Going by the aliases Norman Spear and Roman Wolf, Mr. Nazzaro has said publicly that he and members of his group put less emphasis on campaigns to influence the public and more on developing military and survival skills.
Mr. Nazzaro bought property in Washington State in December 2018, a transaction that has come to the attention of the F.B.I. as part of its investigation into the Base. A left-wing anti-fascist group has said the Base intended to set up a training camp on the land.
The F.B.I. arrested three Base members in January ahead of a pro-gun rights rally in Richmond, Va. Three others in Georgia with ties to the hate group and another in Wisconsin were also arrested as part of the bureau's attempt to blunt its activities.
Russia or Russian oligarchs are already funding far-right groups in Europe, according to current and former officials. The Night Wolves motorcycle club has received support from Russians and has worked to sow chaos in Eastern Europe. The Russian Imperial Movement, another right-wing group with the implicit backing of Moscow, has sent fighters to eastern Ukraine, and other Russian organizations have offered weapons training to far-right groups in Europe.
The tactics date at least to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union tried to exacerbate racial tensions in the United States. "The most successful efforts in these kinds of interference activities are those that exploit real division," Ms. Rosenberger said. "Race is certainly one in the United States."
Independent researchers continue to identify social media accounts with Russian links. Race was among the top issues that such accounts tried to foster division over, said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin professor who studies political communication online. Others included nationalism, immigration, gun control and gay rights.
Ms. Kim tracked posts on Instagram last fall that used tactics similar to Russian operatives' 2016 efforts and confirmed that more than two dozen were Russia-linked. Facebook, which owns Instagram, subsequently took them offline.
"Russia's trolls pretended to be American people, including political groups and candidates," Ms. Kim wrote in a post for the Brennan Center for Justice. "They tried to sow division by targeting both the left and right with posts to foment outrage, fear and hostility. Much of their activity seemed designed to discourage certain people from voting. And they focused on swing states."
In addition to the social media posts, Russian-backed news organizations have also emphasized racially divisive themes, as have Russian government Twitter feeds, though it is only a small portion of their overall postings.
Russia Today, the television station controlled by the Kremlin, has fanned division on both sides. Last week, RT ran a story about a video of New York police arresting a black man that sparked outrage. The organization has also posted tweets aimed at stirring white animosity, publishing an article in January accusing The New York Times of hating white people and criticizing Hank Azaria for quitting as the voice of Apu on "The Simpsons" because of its stereotyping of South Asians.
Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.

Texto completo: A series of Vietnamese pop-ups puts down roots on the Lower East Side; the Mermaid Inn gets a fourth location; and more restaurant news.
Headliner
& Sons
André Hueston Mack, a sommelier and winemaker, started feeling that the expanding roster of well-made American cured hams was not being given its due. "There are ham bars in Spain and France, but nothing like them in New York," he said. So he has now become a hammelier and opened his own spot, a sliver of brick walls and mirrors with just 20 seats in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife, Phoebe Damrosch, a writer and a partner in the restaurant, and their four sons. They have at least 11 American cured heritage-breed hams on the menu. Some are from venerable producers that have been curing hams for 100 years or more, and others are the work of newcomers. Many of the hams are from Kentucky, and some, like the ruddy Dakota, are on a more-or-less exclusive basis. The chef Cesare Casella's prosciutto from upstate New York also gets its turn on the vintage slicer. Cornmeal madeleines and American cheeses are served, and Mr. Mack limits his wines to American selections. "I have about 320 labels, many from vintages going back to the 1970s and '80s," he said. He grew up in Texas, and began his wine career at the French Laundry. He went on to work at Per Se, and left to start making his own wine, which he still does, with Maison Noir Wines, in Oregon. He also runs a wine shop, VyneYard, nearby. In a few months, he plans a retail shop, & Sons Buttery, selling hams, cheeses, condiments and table accessories, next door to the restaurant.

The Norm 54
This restaurant in the Brooklyn Museum is again changing its personality to suit an exhibit: this time, a homage to Studio 54. The menu emphasizes the diner food that clubgoers of the era would seek after hours, like disco fries with melted cheese, Waldorf salad, smoked salmon on a bagel and rich desserts. Drinks will have disco-themed names like Bianca's White Horse. (Friday through July 5)

Closed
Le Petit Rooster
This Upper West Side French bistro has said adieu.
Fine & Schapiro
This kosher deli, an Upper West Side staple for more than 100 years, has closed indefinitely for renovations, a sign on the window reports.
The Usual
The Los Angeles chef Alvin Cailan's New York restaurant has closed after less than two years. Mr. Cailan, who opened Eggslut in Los Angeles in 2011 and then took it to London, Tokyo and the Middle East, dipped his toe into New York waters with a pop-up at Chefs Club Counter three years ago. He also had plans to open a full-service Filipino restaurant, Amboy, in New York last year, but that didn't happen. His brother, Anthony Cailan, a sommelier who was his partner in the Usual, resigned late last year after a New York Times report in which several women said he had sexually assaulted them. Alvin Cailan could not be reached for comment.
Chefs on the Move
Great Gathering of Chefs
"Toques in Black: A Celebration of Black Chefs," (The Chefs Connection, $ 44.95), a new book featuring 101 black chefs, will be honored at a reception on Tuesday, with some of the chefs attending and cooking. The event and sales of the book will benefit programs at the Food and Finance High School in Manhattan.
Tuesday from 6 to 8 p.m., Prince George Ballroom, 15 East 27th Street, tickets, $ 100 and $ 135 (with a copy of the book), thechefsconnection.com.

Texto completo: Maybe you've had a less than stellar experience with scallops. Either they were hard as pencil erasers or so mushy they collapsed under your fork.
If so, please try again. Not only are scallops easy to cook, but they are so mild, they can be the perfect protein for a variety of cooking styles and sauces.
The key to cooking scallops in not overcooking them. As Sam Sifton, food editor at the New York Times, once wrote: "Indeed, there is almost no such thing as an undercooked scallop."
In his new cookbook "See You on Sunday" (Random House, 2020), Sifton includes a dead-simple recipe for caramelized scallops: The extra-large sea scallops are given a dark sear in a neutral oil or clarified butter, so both sides end up with a golden-brown crust.
The path to getting that perfect sear is to dry the scallops well, have the fat hot - close to smoking - and avoid overcrowding the pan. For his recipe, Sifton even recommends cooking them in more than one pan to prevent overcrowding and have them all ready at the same time.
He finishes the scallops with a generous hit of fresh lemon juice, or he gets Sunday-dinner fancy by draping them in the classic French beurre blanc.
Finding the freshest, untreated, dry-packed scallops is also a key to success.
"Wet" scallops are chemically treated with a solution of water and sodium tripolyphosphate so that they stay moist longer.
This can make the scallops mushier, and some folks say they can taste a chemical-like flavor when they cook them. Fresh seafood enthusiasts will tell you to visit a reputable market and ask for freshly shucked "dry" scallops so that you get a pinkish scallop with firm edges.
If you're like me, however, you buy your weeknight dinner ingredients at a neighborhood grocery, so you can check the fresh seafood case and ask if they have dry scallops. Or, consider that frozen scallops may be the best way to go. I tried buying them fresh and sampled a couple of frozen varieties when testing Sifton's recipe. They all turned out well.
To defrost scallops, transfer them from the packaging to a large bowl. Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight.
If you can find only wet scallops, several sources recommended putting them in a brine before cooking.
Sifton suggests a brining method for even the dry-packed scallops, so we tried making them brined and unbrined. The brining did result in tender scallops that stood a bit taller and firmer, but it wasn't essential to success.
If you want to try brining, here's what Sifton recommends: Combine 2 cups of kosher salt in 2 cups of boiling water and stir until the salt dissolves. Then, add 8 cups cold water. Stir again and let the brine cool to room temperature. Add the scallops and brine for 10 minutes. Then, rinse the scallops under cold running water, dry them well, and place them on a clean paper-towel-lined large plate or baking sheet. Cover the scallops with a towel and refrigerate for at least 1 hour but no longer than 2, or, he said, the scallops will turn salty. If you brine the scallops, you will not need to salt them later when cooking.
On a weeknight, however, I'd skip that brining process and spend more time on the saucing. Scallops take less than 10 minutes to sear on both sides, which leaves plenty of time - even on a hectic evening - to make this classic, luscious French sauce. If you've never prepared beurre blanc, which is made with wine, vinegar, shallots and lots and lots of butter, it can seem intimidating, but it requires only about 15 minutes of your attention, a pan and a whisk.
First, minced shallots, vinegar and wine are reduced until the liquid nearly evaporates. Then, cream is added and, with the heat on low, pats of butter are whisked into the mixture.
At the end of that constant whisking, you'll have a creamy emulsion that turns those golden scallop disks into a luxurious entree. In his cookbook, Sifton recommends finishing the meal with a "neat spoonful of rice and a delicate thatch of roasted asparagus, on a table covered with a cloth and a few low candles winking off the wine glasses. Fancy!"
Fancy, indeed.

Pentagon: Difficult terrain slowed recovery of remains of 2 Marines in Iraq

Texto completo: Details of the effort to recover the remains of two elite Marine Raiders killed in Iraq came into better focus Tuesday, with a top U.S. general saying unforgiving mountain terrain and concern for the safety of other U.S. service members dragged the mission out for more than six hours.
Marine Gen. Kenneth "Frank" McKenzie Jr., the chief of U.S. Central Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that commanders monitored the operation on Sunday hour by hour and did everything they could in a challenging environment.
Four other Americans were wounded in the operation.
"It's some of the worst terrain in the world," McKenzie said. "There's no way to do it faster than we did it."
The Marine Corps identified the fallen Americans on Tuesday as Capt. Moises A. Navas of Germantown, Md., and Gunnery Sgt. Diego D. Pongo of Simi Valley, Calif.
Navas was a Special Operations officer, and Pongo was a critical skills operator. The two men, both 34, were assigned to 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, a Special Operations force with headquarters at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
The deaths, the first in combat for the U.S. military in Iraq since August, were announced as the tightknit Marine Raider force marked the fifth anniversary of a helicopter crash off the coast of Florida that killed seven Raiders and four Louisiana National Guardsmen.
The Marines were killed during an operation with Iraqi forces on an Islamic State hideout in the Qara Chokh Mountains near Mahkmour, about 45 miles outside the city of Irbil. Islamic State fighters were entrenched in a tunnel complex, U.S. military officials said.
Army Col. Myles Caggins, a U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, said the caves in the mountains hide both fighters and weapons caches. The militants who engaged the Marines on Sunday had both small arms and explosives. The coalition estimates about 15 to 25 of them were killed, Caggins said.
At the Pentagon, a senior U.S. military official, Navy Rear Adm. William D. Byrne Jr., told reporters the terrain was "vertical."
"That in itself made it extremely difficult," he said. "It was a high-threat environment. We knew that going in, and we took the appropriate precautions going into a high-threat environment."
Byrne said the military is reviewing the incident, as the New York Times reported Monday night.
The Times also reported that the forces called in to recover the Marines included some members of the elite Delta Force, a likely indication of the difficulty of the mission.
A Marine Raider who knew Navas and Pongo, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of their operations, said that when he deployed to Iraq a few years ago, the rough region of the firefight on Sunday was a known Islamic State hotbed.
U.S. forces observing the region could see electronic generators outside the mouths of caves with wires running inside, presumably providing electricity, the Raider said.
The Marine added that both men were well known to be good fathers, and he often saw Navas at school events for their children in North Carolina. Pongo regularly finished first in individual training events, the Marine added.
"These guys were both natural-born leaders," he said.

Virus 'infodemic' swamps social media gatekeepers

Texto completo: Headnote U.N. joins platforms in dealing with misinformation
SAN FRANCISCO - First, there were conspiratorial whispers on social media that the coronavirus had been cooked up in a secret government iab in China Then there were bogus medicines: gels, liquids and powders that immunized against the virus.
And then there were the false claims about governments and celebrities and racial unrest. Taiwan was covering up virus deaths, and the illness was spiraling out of control. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who now runs a philanthropic organization, was behind the spread of the virus. Italians were marching in the streets, accusing Chinese people of bringing the illness to their country.
None of it was true.
As the coronavirus has spread across the world, so too has misinformation about it, despite an aggressive effort by social media companies to prevent its dissemination. Facebook, Google and Twitter said they were removing misinformation about the coronavirus as fast as they could find it, and were working with the World Health Organization and other government organizations to ensure that people got accurate information.
But a search by The New York Times found dozens of videos, photographs and written posts on each of the social media platforms that appeared to have slipped through the cracks. The posts were not limited to English. Many were originally in languages ranging from Hindi and Urdu to Hebrew and Farsi, reflecting the trajectory of the virus as it has traveled around the world.
Security researchers have even found that hackers were setting up threadbare websites that claimed to have information about the coronavirus. The sites were actually digital traps, aimed at stealing personal data or breaking into the devices of people who landed on them.
The spread of false and malicious content about the coronavirus has been a stark reminder of the uphill battle fought by researchers and internet companies. Even when the companies are determined to protect the truth, they are often outgunned and outwitted by the internet's liars and thieves.
There is so much inaccurate information about the virus, the WHO has said it was confronting a "infodemic.
"I see misinformation about the coronavirus everywhere. Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other people are spreading conspiracies," said Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
Facebook, YouTube and Twitter all said they were making efforts to point people back to reliable sources of medical information, and had direct lines of communication to the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Facebook said it bans content that could cause people harm, such as claims that discourage treatment or taking appropriate precautions against the coronavirus. Posts and videos that shared conspiracy theories were clearly marked as false, once they had been reviewed by fact checkers.
When Facebook users attempt to share them, a message pops up alerting the user that the post includes information that has been deemed false by fact checkers.
Those measures, however, have not stopped people in private Facebook groups from linking to and sharing misinformation surrounding the virus. In private Facebook groups, including one that totals more than 100,000 members, conspiracy theories spread that the coronavirus was an invention of the pharmaceutical industry, intended to sell the public on more expensive drugs and more vaccines.
While many posts simply encouraged people to take vitamins and eat a balanced diet to boost their immune system, others offered promises of immunity or cures if certain combinations of powders and drinks were consumed. Some were even more dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration referred to one "miracle mineral solution posted many times on Facebook and Twitter as "the same as drinking bleach.
Chiang, the gastroenterologist, recently helped start the Association for Healthcare Social Media, a group dedicated to encouraging more health care professionals to post on social media so that they can dispel some of the misinformation.
"People are looking for good sources of information because a lot of what they see, when they log into their social media platforms, is just scaring them, he said.
While Twitter acknowledged the presence of some of this content on its network, Del Harvey, Twitters vice president of trust and safety, said the company has not seen "large-scale, coordinated" efforts to misinform people about the coronavirus. After The New York Times contacted Twitter with examples of tweets containing health misinformation about coronavirus, some owners of the accounts were suspended "for spam."
Facebook said that in addition to working closely with health organizations, it was offering WHO free ad space to try to point people toward accurate information on the coronavirus. The company said that it was removing posts that discouraged people from seeking treatment or suggested remedies that could cause physical harm and that it was placing warning labels on posts that were rated false by their fact checkers.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, also said it was working closely with WHO to help combat misinformation. YouTubes spokesman, Farshad Shadloo, said the company had policies that prohibited videos that "promoted medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment.
Dozens of YouTube videos, however, included titles that suggested the video offered a cure for the virus. In others, the comment sections below the videos included links to pages offering a range of alternative, unsubstantiated treatments.
In some cases, those links have led people to websites that lure people in with the promise of a cure, but actually steal credit card information and other personal details.
The cybersecurity firm Check Point said more than 4,000 coronavirus-related websites that include words like "corona or covid have been registered since the beginning of the year. Of those, 3% were considered malicious and another 5% were suspicious.

Texto completo: Broadway shows, Davóne Tines' arias, Davido's Afrobeats, Oona Doherty's solos: Here is a rundown of what New York Times critics and writers are looking forward to this season.
Broadway
"Hangmen": Feeling the need for a caffeinated jolt of stylish suspense, the kind that has your nails carving crescents into your palms?
It's been a while since Broadway has seen such gratifying, Hitchcockian fare. But that vacuum will be filled when Martin McDonagh's "Hangmen" opens March 19 at the Golden Theater. A master of corkscrew plotting and chilling wit, McDonagh ("The Beauty Queen of Leenane," the film "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri") here considers the troubling, unexpected aftermath of one of Britain's last executions.
I first caught this play in London and then again when it made its New York debut off-Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company. I look forward to being properly unnerved all over again with this latest incarnation, directed by Matthew Dunster and featuring Dan Stevens ("Downton Abbey") as one very sinister seducer.
-Ben Brantley
"Flying Over Sunset": Sometimes what's most exciting is what's least known. And few shows have arrived on Broadway as little known as "Flying Over Sunset," which opens at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on April 16. It's not only a new musical but also an entirely original one, with no precursor movie, novel, cartoon or play to give it shape and curb appeal. Whatever it is, it will have to succeed on its own.
Which is not to say it has no names attached; it's dripping with names. You may have heard of its three main characters, for instance, all hanging around Hollywood in the mid-1950s: Cary Grant, debonair movie star; Clare Booth Luce, ambassador and congresswoman; Aldous Huxley, British intellectual. Or the three inside-Broadway actors who play them: Tony Yazbeck ("On the Town") as Grant, Carmen Cusack ("Bright Star") as Luce, Harry Hadden-Paton ("My Fair Lady") as Huxley.
Then there are the names backstage. The music is by Tom Kitt ("Next to Normal"), the lyrics are by Michael Korié ("Grey Gardens"), the book and direction are by James Lapine ("Sunday in the Park With George"). I am sure the prop master is illustrious, too.
So what are all these promising names promising? I'm happy not to know much more than that the three main characters, each of whom experimented with LSD at the time, in Lapine's fictional world share trips together. The characters sing only when they're high; with any luck, that's how they'll leave the audience, too.
-Jesse Green
"Caroline, Or Change": When "Caroline, or Change" opened at the Public Theater in 2003, it was a musical out of the blue. It had no source material beyond the childhood of Tony Kushner, who wrote the book. Like the boy Noah Gellman in "Caroline," Kushner grew up in an artistic Jewish home in Louisiana whose major players included not only his musician parents but also the family maid, a woman he thought he knew but didn't.
The musical that grew from these seeds - with a gorgeous score by Jeanine Tesori - came out of the blue in another sense: It was steeped in sadness. There's the sadness of Noah, whose mother has died, but also the sadness of Caroline, the maid, a single Black mother with four children she can hardly support on $30 a week. The connection between these two lonely people, made up of necessity that becomes a kind of grudging love and then an expression of cruelty, suggests a national sadness, one that in 1963, when the musical is set, was just beginning to crack into upheaval.
That the original Broadway production, in 2004, was not a financial success - despite a brilliant production by George C. Wolfe and a towering central performance by Tonya Pinkins - seemed to deliver an additional sting of injustice. Some critics found it dour and didactic and some audiences apparently found its sadness off-putting.
Sixteen years later, the theatrical and political ground having shifted around it, "Caroline, or Change," imported from London by the Roundabout Theater Company with its star, Sharon D. Clarke, may have found a time to match its thesis: that change is always needful, always painful.

"How I Learned To Drive": he laughs might be different this time, but the comedy was always surprising in Paula Vogel's breathtaking beauty of a memory play, never more so than in the 1997 premiere, which starred Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse in a story of sexual abuse that shifts ever backward, to its beginning.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning play's Broadway debut - starting previews March 27 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater - reunites the original director, Mark Brokaw, with Parker as Li'l Bit, a girl whose fatherlessness leaves her vulnerable, and Morse as Peck, the charismatic uncle who lavishes her with attention. Preying incrementally on Li'l Bit, he grooms her for more.
In the decades since Vogel wrote "How I Learned to Drive," mainstream culture has learned much about predation and trauma - from child sexual-abuse scandals and from the #MeToo movement, which has made the methodical nature of abuse starkly clear. What's staggering as the play returns is to see how deeply it has always understood the nature of that targeting: as systematic as a driving manual and couched in secrecy.
The pitch-perfect original production - which won Obie Awards for Vogel, Brokaw, Parker and Morse - was surprising, and uncomfortable, for its capacious empathy and the well-matched allure of its stars. But in the landscape of Vogel's keen-eyed drama, neither memory nor emotion is uncomplicated, even when the harm is plain. It will be fascinating, in our black-and-white world, to see how that lands with audiences now.

Off-Broadway
"The Bedwetter": Sarah Silverman sings!
Well, she already has, hasn't she - most memorably when she performed a graphic song about her carnal relationship with Matt Damon to bait her boyfriend at the time, Jimmy Kimmel. But in this case, other performers will be giving melodious voice to the always arresting musings of this take-no-prisoners comedian.
The occasion is the musical adaptation of "The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee," Silverman's best-selling 2010 memoir of a urinesoaked childhood in New Hampshire, during which she showed an uncanny precocity for bad taste and blue humor. (As Dave Itzkoff wrote of the book in The New York Times, "Not even an early bomb - a failed joke about the accidental death of her baby brother, Jeffrey - could discourage Silverman's youthful showmanship.")
The Atlantic Theater Company's stage version, opening in April, features a book by Silverman and seriously funny playwright Josh Harmon ("Bad Jews," "Admissions"), with music by pop composer Adam Schlesinger, late of Fountains ofWayne. (Remember "Stacy's Mom," the 2003 hit about teenage lust?)
The adventurous Anne Kauffman ("Mary Jane," "Marjorie Prime") directs a cast that includes Tony-winning musical theater eminences Stephanie J. Block ("The Cher Show," "Falsettos") and Linda Lavin ("The Tale of the Allergist's Wife," "The Lyons"). It is perhaps of particular interest that Silverman is collaborating with Schlesinger on the lyrics. Let the speculation begin on possible rhymes for the ripe, Anglo-Saxon words that are a staple of the Silverman vocabulary.

"Lungs": You may know them better as the Windsors - the lovely young monarch and her dashing consort in the first two seasons of the Netflix series "The Crown." So sparky was the chemistry between Claire Foy, as Queen Elizabeth П, and Matt Smith, as Prince Philip, that it made you hope the real royals once had something like that, too.
Their casting, then, is the principal reason for excitement about Duncan Macmillan's "Lungs" coming to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in late March. Directed by Tony Award winner Matthew Warchus ("Matilda the Musical"), Foy and Smith play a middle-class couple contemplating parenthood and the future of a warming planet.
It was a hit last fall at the Old Vic in London, where Matt Wolf, reviewing for The Times, called Foy and Smith "irresistible," and even higher-wattage live than on TV. And a spare set by Rob Howell (a Tony winner for "The Ferryman") puts the focus squarely on the acting - exactly where we want it to be.
-Laura Collins-Hughes
"Nollywood Dreams": Funny plays are hard to write, in short supply and desperately needed. That's why I've been waiting impatiently for Jocelyn Bioh's "Nollywood Dreams" - which opens April 13 - ever since seeing her 2017 breakthrough, "School Girls; or the African Mean Girls Play." That comedy, which was also an MCC Theater production, adapted the "Mean Girls" template to a high school in Ghana, where the catty, competitive tropes of the genre turned into something fresh. Biting, too; what might have been silly in a contest of blondes cut much deeper when colorism was at the heart of the matter.
Yet Bioh, whose other career as an actor informs her highly performable playwriting, looks at her subjects through a comedy lens. You won't find what she calls "poverty porn" in her depictions of Africa. "Nollywood Dreams" (directed by Saheem Ali) is set in the Nigerian film industry in the 1990s, as it is aiming to cross over into Western success. When one of the industry's hottest directors holds open auditions for his latest movie, ingenues, heartthrobs and spurned divas get tangled in the plot.
If that outline sounds familiar, so did the one for "Mean Girls"; familiarity is part of what makes Bioh's writing so efficient. She lets the genre do a lot of the work while digging behind it to see what treasure it hides. The laughs are so plentiful you hardly knowyou've been taken somewhere new.

Dance
New York City Ballet:
What do choreographers Jamar Roberts and Pam Tanowitz have in common? (Aside from their obsession with modern dance, that is.)
When Roberts was in middle school and watching dance videos, nearly everythinghe sawwas of New York City Ballet. Tanowitz has done the same thing for years, camping out for hours at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and studying the works of two of her heroes, George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins.
This spring, City Ballet has commissioned works by both Roberts, the resident choreographer and a veteran member of Alvin Alley American Dance Theater, and Tanowitz. These promise to be welcome, refreshing additions to the repertoire, but even better is how each choreographer - despite being an outsider - will approach the City Ballet stage from a place of love.
This will be Tanowitz's second piece for the company. Following up on her "Bartok Ballet" of last year, Tanowitz will braid her inventive footwork and crisp musicality in a new work, premiering April 24 and set to Ted Hearne's "Law of Mosaics."
Tanowitz sees her commission as an experiment. In an email interview, she said, "How do you change the governing principles of creating a work in an environment that has its own history and at the same time stay true to yourself?"
Her ballet will feature 14 dancers, lighting by Brandon Stirling Baker, as well as costumes by Tome, which lent a previous work of hers, for the Martha Graham company, a magistertal elegance. The women, she said, will dance on point. And she has many steps up her sleeve for couples.
"All my notes are spatial patterns and puzzles until I get in the room," she said. "I have a version that starts with full cast onstage and leave one by one and then I have the reverse."
As for Roberts, his first work for City Ballet - "Three Encounters at the End of Some World," opening May 7 - is in part a response to a quotation by Balanchine: "Dancers are instruments, like a piano the choreographer plays."
He has previously created two urgent, sweeping dances for the Alley company. Here, he wants to explore his cast - three men and three women - as individuals. "What about finding the beauty and the flaws in something that is actually human?" Roberts said. "I just want to know who they are, and I want to find that out through the work."
The springboard for "Three Encounters, ' set to music by Kyle Preston, is the notion of science fiction and fantasy - and how they relate to storied ballets like "Swan Lake" and "The Nutcracker," which require the suspension of disbelief.
Roberts described the mood of his premiere as dire, imbued by a sense of desperation. "It's an X-ray being put on these little private dramas backlit by something that feels really epic," he said. "Like the feeling of it being the end of the world: how we continue to love in the midst of duress."

Classical Music
Davone Tines: At just 33, the immensely gifted American bass-baritone
Tines has won acclaim, and advanced the field of classical music, through frequent associations with living composers. In recent years, he sang in the premiere of John Adams' "Girls of the Golden West," Matthew Aucoin's "Crossing," Terence Blanchard's "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" and more, including the American premiere of Kaija Saariaho's "Only the Sound Remains." Working with composer Michael Schächter, he adapted Langston Hughes' 1931 poem "The Black Clown" into a teeming work of music theater and dance, winning raves for his ferocious performance.
Tines may be most drawn to new, recent and overlooked pieces. But he still performs some standard repertory; it would be a loss if an artist like Tines' didn't. Both sides of his career will be on display when he performs April 3 at Weill Recital Hall, as part of Carnegie Hall's Evenings of Song series.
His program is a model of adventurousness and a personal exploration. Joined by pianist Adam Nielsen, he will sing arias from Bach cantatas and selections from "St. Matthew Passion," alongside traditional spirituals and a diverse selection of songs by Margaret Bonds, a pioneering 20th-century black composer; Caroline Shaw, who has written a new work for Tines; Tyshawn Sorey, the drummer and composer who has excelled in jazz and contemporary classical idioms; and Julius Eastman, who died in 1990 and whose visionary work is now being rediscovered.
The same night as this recital, the Philadelphia Orchestra is presenting Beethoven Symphonies in Carnegie's main auditorium. But in the smaller Weill space, Tines' program may have more to say about the future of classical music.

And RICHARD LARDNER
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Juul Labs, the nation's largest electronic-cigarette company, donated tens of thousands of dollars to the campaigns of state attorneys general in an effort to build relationships with these powerful
Officials and potentially head off legal challenges over how it promoted and sold its vaping products.
But the company's approach hasn't stopped officials from taking action. Thirty-nine states announced late last month that they will investigate whether Juul's early viral marketing efforts illegally targeted teens and made misleading claims about the level of nicotine in its devices. Health officials have declared underage vaping an
Epidemic, largely driven by the discrete, high-nicotine, fruity flavored pods that Juul sold until late last year.
"Juul really created this crisis," said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner. "Juul created the pool of nicotine-addicted teens and I think they popularized the idea of vaping among kids."
The Food and Drug Administration and Congress are probing whether Juul's early promotions deliberately appealed to minors, including the use of online influencers, "launch parties," and product giveaways. Yet Juul may face an even bigger threat from the
Nation's state attorneys general, who previously used their collective power to force changes in the way Big Tobacco companies do business.
In an emailed response to written questions, a Juul spokesman declined to say how many state attorneys general company representatives have met with. Juul, the spokesman said, is working to earn "the trust of society," by working with government officials. The company says its outreach to attorneys general was aimed at collaborating with them on key issues, including combating underage use.
Documents obtained by The Associated Press through open records requests shed new light on the unusual connection Juul forged with Iowa's Tom Miller, the longest-serving state attorney general in U.S. history. The records show Miller served as a behind-the-scenes
Adviser, helping the company respond to media requests and inquiries from government officials. Miller did not receive campaign contributions from Juul.
The documents also provide new details about former state attorneys general who were hired by the company, including Massachusetts' Martha Coakley, who became a key messenger as Juul made the case that it was working to keep its products away from minors while simultaneously pitching its technology as an anti-smoking tool for adults.
Juul's outreach included thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to individual state attorneys general, five of whom later met with the company's representatives, according to the records. The company also donated $50,000 each to the Republican and Democratic fundraising committees that support the election of attorneys general candidates. Those donations won Juul corporate membership in both groups.
Before Juul began donating money to campaign coffers, the company forged an unlikely partnership with Miller, the Iowa attorney general with 37 years in office. A Democrat, Miller frequently cites his work on the landmark 1998 settlement with the tobacco industry. His office hasn't joined the multistate investigation of Juul.
Emails obtained by the AP show that Juul sought Miller's counsel on how to respond to inquiries from government officials and media outlets. And even as more teens were vaping, Miller urged the public not to "overreact." Portions of Juul's interactions with Miller were previously reported by Politico and Vice News.
Former state law officials say there is little precedent for such a close partnership between an attorney general and a private company.
Miller told the AP he became involved with Juul to try to help stop underage use of the company's products.
By spring 2018, Juul and Miller were in regular contact, emails show. In April, his office issued a press release titled, "Juul offers opportunity to reduce smoking rates," highlighting the company's potential to shift smokers away from cigarettes.
In subsequent months, Juul would seek Miller's guidance or encourage him to conduct interviews with journalists from The New York Times, NBC and CBS, amid nationwide reports of teens becoming
Addicted to Juul.
In April 2019, Miller penned a positive profile of Juul co-founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen for Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people.
Miller rejected any suggestions that Juul benefited from its association with him. He stressed that his involvement with the company centered on vaping's potential to reduce smoking.
"It wasn't to speak well of Juul," Miller told the AP in an interview.
In late October 2018, Juul's political action committee donated more than $38,000 to incumbent state attorneys general and one first-time candidate for the office, according to campaign finance records. Documents obtained from state officials show Juul representatives later secured meetings with several attorneys general or their senior staff.
The meetings gave Juul an opportunity to promote its vaping products over traditional paper cigarettes, using customized slide presentations detailing the health toll of states' smoking rates.
When Juul met with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr and his staff in May 2019, the company's team included a new hire: Martha Coakley, the former attorney general of Massachusetts. Coakley, a Democrat, had joined the company a month earlier, giving Juul another messenger with a state attorney general's credentials.
"We look forward to staying in touch," Coakley told Carr's chief of staff in a post-meeting email.
Katie Byrd, Carr's spokeswoman, said a $3,000 contribution made by Juul's political action committee to Carr's 2018 reelection campaign wasn't a factor in his decision to accept the meeting.
But the one-on-one time didn't prevent additional scrutiny.
Last month, Carr announced he was joining 38 other attorneys general investigating Juul.
"Our office is committed to learning all the facts so that we can best protect Georgia's youth from products that could be harmful to them," Carr said in a statement.

NFL players' union extends CBA voting deadline to Saturday

Texto completo: NEW YORK – The NFL players’ union extended the deadline by two days for its members to vote on a new labor agreement with the league.
Ballots from some 2,500 members now are due at 9:59 p.m. MDT on Saturday. The NFL Players Association gave no reason for the extension, though reaching so many players to meet the previous deadline of one week certainly can present logistical problems.
The union said on Twitter the extension came after a vote by player representatives.
“Every vote matters and we encourage all players to review the materials sent via email in order to make an informed decision,” the union wrote.
Tackle Russell Okung, recently traded from the Chargers to the Panthers and who is running for union president as Eric Winston steps aside, wonders about the process – enough so that he filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board claiming the NFLPA negotiated the agreement with the league in bad faith.
Okung accused NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith of rushing to a vote on the new deal after objections from the union’s executive board, which voted 6-5 against it.
The unusual move by Okung comes one day before the 32 player reps vote for a new president. The other candidates are Buccaneers linebacker Sam Acho, Giants safety Michael Thomas and Browns center JC Tretter.
The New York Times first reported Okung’s action with the NLRB.
The 32 NFL owners approved the deal last month. The NFLPA’s executive board then rejected it, but the player reps voted 17-14 in favor. A simple majority of the union membership is required to accept or reject the contract that would run through the 2030 season.
Every player who was a dues-paying member during the 2019 season received a ballot, the NFLPA said. Votes will be confidential and received by an independent auditor.
The owners need labor peace to maximize their leverage in the next round of billion-dollar television contracts.
With the owners unwavering in their favor of a 17-game regular season, which would begin as soon as 2021 and no later than 2023, players have focused more on safeguards for the additional wear and tear, additional roster spots, and an increased share of the revenue that would grow with the extra game.
Many high-profile players have adamantly spoken out against the proposal, including Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson, Houston defensive end J.J. Watt, Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey and Minnesota wide receiver Stefon Diggs.
Their primary contention with the terms is that they don’t go far enough to reward and protect the players for the extra game. Pouncey went so far as to announce recently on social media he was arranging a contingency fund with fellow critics Mike Pouncey, his brother, and Okung that would assist young players in the event of a strike.

Maine CDC: 20 tests returned, all negative for the coronavirus

Texto completo: Initial test results show that no Mainers have tested positive for the coronavirus as of 1 p.m. Tuesday. For the latest coronavirus news, click here.
Twenty of the tests that Maine health officials have conducted for coronavirus have come back negative, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, the state is still waiting on the results of another five tests that have also been done, according to the Maine CDC. The results were posted at 1 p.m. Tuesday on the Maine CDC's website.
So far, no Mainer has tested positive for the virus, known as COVID-19.
Maine CDC Director Nirav Shah said Tuesday there still remains a "possibility" that the virus is circulating in Maine, given that relatively few residents have been tested so far.
Hospitals and long-term care facilities have been advised to prepare for the possibility that it could be spreading undetected in a process known as community transmission, based on the cases of community transmission that have been documented in the Pacific Northwest, Shah said.
Those tested in Maine so far all were experiencing potential symptoms of coronavirus, and include a mix of people who had returned from a country with a significant outbreak or come into contact with an infected individual. The decision to test a patient for coronavirus is made by a medical provider, who can send a sample to the Maine CDC for testing, Shah said.
The current lack of confirmed cases has given the Maine CDC time to prepare as the state looks to help health care providers and long term care facilities prevent the kind of coronavirus outbreaks seen in other states, Shah said. The state was preparing for a potential outbreak by working with hospitals on disease protocols and considering potential equipment shortages.
In a statement to the Bangor Daily News on Tuesday, Gov. Janet Mills said she was confident the state was "preparing as best as possible" for a potential outbreak.
"Because this is an evolving situation, we will remain in close contact with the U.S. CDC, continue our preparedness efforts, and stay in regular communication with our hospitals, schools, EMS, local communities, and others," Mills said.
Medical providers have been advised to immediately isolate any patient suspected of having the coronavirus, Shah said. Maine CDC was also preparing for a scenario where the number of ill patients might exceed hospital capacity, and telling providers to consider postponing elective surgeries and taking other steps to increase the number of hospital beds available.
Shah said the CDC was also working with providers to take stock of medical supplies in case of potential shortages, which he identified as a serious concern.
"We are very, very concerned about this situation," Shah said. "We have an entire team within the Maine CDC whose full time job it is to keep tabs on [personal protective equipment] and work with provider groups to make sure that those supplies are adequate. "
Maine ramped up its testing for the coronavirus last week after the federal government expanded the criteria for who could be tested for it and also supplied the Maine CDC with its own equipment to run the tests. Shah said his agency had seen a spike in calls about coronavirus in recent days, with 80 calls from medical providers over the weekend and 119 on Monday.
Maine is the only New England state that still doesn't have a confirmed case of the new coronavirus which has sickened more than 750 people in the U.S. as of Tuesday, including at least 26 who have died, according to the New York Times.
The Maine CDC's laboratory in Augusta can now perform tests for between 100 and 200 patients per day, Shah said. The facility only began testing for the virus over the weekend, while the state had previously relied on sending patients' samples to a federal facility in Atlanta for testing.
The agency completed 10 of the 20 negative tests at its offices in Augusta, while the other 10 were completed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Shah said. He said the agency will notify the public if there is a positive test.
Since originating in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, the virus has spread to at least 100 countries, the New York Times has reported.
According to the World Health Organization, as of Tuesday more than 113,000 cases had been reported worldwide and more than 4,000 people had died from the disease.
As with the common cold or influenza, COVID-19 spreads when an infected person coughs or exhales, emitting small droplets, according to the World Health Organization. People who have COVID-19 have shown flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. The infection might also spread before people show symptoms, according to the CDC.

Texto completo: It started with face masks. Then hand sanitizers started flying off of store shelves.
Alicia Mumma watched as a man standing in the checkout line at Save Mart, Fruitville Pike, bought $200 worth of hand sanitizer last week.
As soon as that man left, the cashier got a phone call from a person asking if the store had any sanitizer left, Mumma said.
When LNP | LancasterOnline visited the Manheim Township store on Thursday, there were no hand sanitizer bottles left on the shelves, and none were left in stock, according to employees.
The store’s employees said it was the customer’s fear of the global coronavirus’ (COVID-19) outbreak that led to the location running out of face masks and hand sanitizers in recent weeks.
Pennsylvania had six presumed positive cases of COVID-19 as of Sunday evening, according to the state Department of Health. The cases had not yet been confirmed by the national Centers for Disease Control.
The CDC advises against wearing masks, saying shoppers should leave them for health professionals. The CDC encourages people to wash their hands with soap and water and -- if neither is available -- to use hand sanitizer.

But has that slowed down hand sanitizer sales? New York Times reported last week that stores were completely running out-of-stock and suppliers were having problems fulfilling orders.
LNP | LancasterOnline visited 40 stores in Lancaster County on Thursday.
Of the 40 stores, only four had any hand sanitizer left on shelves at that time.
Bath & Body Works in Park City, was the only store that was fully stocked with mini 1-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer. However, their website was sold out of the gels as of Thursday afternoon.
Two Five Below stores had a handful of large bottles of hand sanitizer and about two dozen 1 oz bottles each. The location on Lincoln Highway implemented a limit of five bottles of hand sanitizer per person last week, according to an employee.
The Weis location on Willow Street had 17 packages of 1-ounce Dora The Explorer two-pack hand sanitizers.
Bed Bath & Beyond had about two dozen small bottles of hand sanitizer, but none had the CDC recommended 60% alcohol; all were 0% alcohol per bottle.
By 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, Wegmans in Manheim Township had no hand sanitizer bottles in store.
"Availability of hand sanitizer is limited. We continue to receive shipments and are pushing products out to stores as soon as it arrives,” Deana Percassi, a Wegmans Food Market spokeswoman, said. “We are working closely with our suppliers to manage inventory, and are expanding our product assortment to increase the availability of hand sanitizer.”
Similarly to what Five Below implemented, Percassi said that Wegmans is limiting purchases to three bottles per customer.
Across the 40 stores, employees told stories of shipments arriving with only a handful of bottles of hand sanitizer, of customers buying out entire supplies, their struggle to keep shelves stocked and constantly getting the question, “Where can I find the hand sanitizer?”
Online, Amazon’s third-party sellers marked-up hand sanitizers as high as $150 for a two-pack throughout the week.
Senator Edward Markey, of Massachusetts, criticized the price gouging, writing a letter to Amazon that he said was prompted when he saw 24 2-ounce Purell hand sanitizer bottles that typically sell for $10 listed as $400.
Amazon released a statement Friday saying that the company is working with state attorneys general to identify and prosecute sellers who were taking advantage of customer’s fears over the spreading coronavirus and engaging in price gouging, according to Reuters.
Here's what's happening in Lancaster County to prepare for threat of COVID-19 [full coverage]
At the Target on Fruitville Pike on Thursday, a customer suggested LNP | LancasterOnline visit the Walmart down the street, saying she found large pump bottles there on Wednesday.
The Walmart, which had already been visited, was out of stock.
“I’m glad I stocked up,” the customer said, as she rolled her cart away.

The simple reason that the left keeps losing

Texto completo: How did the political left squander the opportunity that was the 2020 primary campaign?
The Trump presidency has created tremendous energy among progressives. More than half of Democratic voters now identify as liberal. Most favor “Medicare for All.” A growing number are unhappy with American capitalism.
This year’s campaign offered the prospect of transformational change, with a Democratic nominee who was more liberal than any in more than a half-century. Instead, the nominee now seems likely to be a moderate white grandfather who first ran for president more than 30 years ago and whose campaign promises a return to normalcy.
True, Bernie Sanders could make a comeback, but it would need to be a big one. Among people who voted on Super Tuesday itself — rather than voting early, before Joe Biden won South Carolina — Biden trounced Sanders. The race would have to change fundamentally for Sanders to win.
If he doesn’t, the obvious questions for progressives is what went wrong and how they can do better in the future. I think there are some clear answers — empirical answers that anybody, regardless of ideology, should be able to see.
The biggest lesson is simply this: The American left doesn’t care enough about winning.
It’s an old problem, one that has long undermined left-wing movements in this country. They have often prioritized purity over victory.
They wouldn’t necessarily put it these terms, but they have chosen to lose on their terms rather than win with compromise.
You can see this pattern today in the ways that many progressive activists misread public opinion. Their answer to almost every question of political strategy is to insist that Americans are a profoundly progressive people who haven’t yet been inspired to vote the way they think. The way to win, these progressives claim, is to go left, always.
Immigration? Most Americans want more of it. Abortion? This is a pro-choice country. Strict gun control? Affirmative action? A wealth tax? Free college? Medicare for All? Widely available marijuana? Americans want it all, activists claim.
This belief helps explain why so many 2020 candidates hoping to win the progressive vote — including Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris — embraced ideas like a ban on fracking and the decriminalization of the border. The left persuaded itself that those policies were both morally righteous and politically savvy. To reject any one of them was to risk being labeled a neoliberal sellout.
As luck would have it, the Democratic Party has a loyal group of voters who, though hardly monolithic, tend to be more pragmatic and less wishful than progressive activists. They also tend to be culturally moderate, as many swing voters are.
This group, of course, is black voters, especially those middle-aged and older. They just swung the 2020 nomination away from Sanders and toward Biden. Until progressives figure out how to do better with black voters, they are going to have a hard time winning.
And the same strategies that will help progressives win more black voters in the primaries are also likely to win over more swing voters in a general election.

Texto completo: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has ordered a containment zone in New Rochelle, a small city that has become a coronavirus hot spot, and deployed the state National Guard to help.
“New Rochelle has double the cases of New York City. It’s true. It’s a phenomenon,” he told reporters Tuesday at a press briefing in White Plains.
Of the 173 confirmed cases in all of New York, 108 of them are in New Rochelle.

New York National Guard troops arrived earlier Tuesday at the New Rochelle health department, where they will team up with city health officials to collect samples to test for the coronavirus around town, according to the Times Union.
Schools will close for at least two weeks starting Thursday, Cuomo said, as will “major gathering places," community centers, and places of worship. The containment area will have a one-mile radius centered around a synagogue that state officials say could be the center of the outbreak, the New York Times reported.
People will still be able to walk around town, and grocery stores will remain open. Cuomo also said he would not be placing travel restrictions on New Rochelle residents.
“You’re not containing people,” he said. “You’re containing facilities.”

Media discover ‘Wuhan virus’ and 'Chinese coronavirus’ are racist dog whistles just in time to attack Republicans

Texto completo: The same news media that spent the entire new year referring to COVID-19 as the “Wuhan virus,” the "Wuhan coronavirus," or the “Chinese coronavirus” have decided this week that those terms are racist now that Republicans are using them with greater frequency.

I guess we are supposed to forget about all those times that newsgroups referred to the virus by the name of the county and city where it reportedly originated and blindly accept that it is probably racist when Republicans do the same.

“Some conservatives, including Mike Pompeo, Sen. Tom Cotton and Rep. Paul Gosar, are using the term ‘Wuhan virus’ to describe Covid-19,” the New York Times reported Tuesday. “Critics accused the term, which goes against the recommendation of health officials, of being racist and xenophobic.”

Uh-huh.

I would love to know what those same health officials thought when the New York Times reported on Jan. 21 that, “The first U.S. case of the Wuhan coronavirus has been confirmed in Washington State.”

The press’s attempt this week to legitimize claims that these terms are racist comes not long after House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy shared a CDC fact sheet on social media, saying, “Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus can be found on one, regularly-updated website.”

Democratic lawmakers weirdly decided at that moment that terms like “Chinese coronavirus” are now problematic.

"I’m embarrassed to be his colleague," Democratic National Committee Vice Chairwoman and New York Rep. Grace Meng said Monday evening. "I’m so disgusted. We await his apology to the nation, the Chinese-American and [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community and to his own constituents."

Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California said later that same day, “One reason [POTUS] & his enablers failed to contain COVID2019 is due to the myopic focus on China. ... Calling it Chinese coronavirus is scientifically wrong & as stupid as calling it the Italian coronavirus.”

“Viruses don't have nationalities,” anti-Semite and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the next morning. “This is racist.”

And, wouldn’t you know it, members of the press decided somewhere around that time that, actually, terms such as “Wuhan virus,” which they had been using all along to refer to COVID-19, may actually be pretty problematic.

Thank you, GOP, for opening our eyes!

“Republicans face backlash over racist labeling of coronavirus,” the Guardian reported Tuesday. There is no mention in the report of the Jan. 20 Guardian headline that reads, “A man lies dead in the street: the image that captures the Wuhan coronavirus crisis.”

Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona is “coming under fire for calling the coronavirus the 'Wuhan Virus,'" NBC News reported late Monday, “a reference to the Chinese city where the outbreak started that some critics say is racist and evidence of anti-Asian bias.”

It is weird that NBC would humor these nonsense criticisms of Gosar considering NBC published a report on Jan. 24 that used both the term “Wuhan virus” and “Wuhan coronavirus.” It is doubly weird considering NBC’s sister network, CNBC, published a headline on Jan. 17 titled, “The CDC and Homeland Security begin screening for Chinese Coronavirus at three major US airports as outbreak spreads in Asia.”

The Washington Post meanwhile published an op-ed Tuesday titled, “The two reasons administration officials and Trump allies are linking the coronavirus to China.” Its author, Philip Bump, claims the “sudden push” by Republicans to identify the coronavirus as coming from China is part of “a geopolitical hedge” and also a way “to deflect blame away from the administration.”

A separate Post commentary article published on March 9 said in its headline, “Is it racist to call coronavirus the ‘Wuhan Virus’? GOP congressman’s self-quarantine tweet sparks a debate.”

That is funny because I remember when the Post published a hard news report on Jan. 21 titled, “First U.S. case of potentially deadly Chinese coronavirus confirmed in Washington state.” I also remember the Jan. 24 Post report titled, “Scientists are unraveling the Chinese coronavirus with unprecedented speed and openness.”

The Sacramento Bee even published an editorial Tuesday morning titled, “Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s coronavirus tweet echoes anti-Chinese racism. He must apologize.”

As a reminder, here are a handful of headlines published earlier this year by the exact same news outlet:

The Chinese Communist Party thanks you all for your efforts.

There is no great mystery as to why President Trump and his allies refer to COVID-19 as the “Chinese coronavirus” and the “Wuhan virus.” They call it that because it reportedly originated in China, in Wuhan specifically. They also call it that because that is how the virus was branded from the very beginning by the same newsrooms that claim now that the terms may be highly problematic.

These reporters and pundits know we can see what they are doing, right?

Texto completo: A group of House Democrats reportedly walked out of an election security briefing on Tuesday, upset after U.S. intelligence officials told them they hadn’t reached an assessment on whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin developed a preference for President Trump in the 2020 election.
National security leaders from the FBI, NSA, Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the full House and Senate during classified briefings that “they don't have direct knowledge” that Putin “has developed a preference for a candidate in the 2020 U.S. presidential election,” according to sources cited by CNN. The new report said, “Briefers contended that Putin's goal is to sow discontent.”

CNN’s Manu Raju tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff “raised questions, since it conflicted with what a briefer told House Intel last month.” He said, “Some Dems walked out, with some saying they lacked confidence in briefers" and said it was the first election security briefing for the full House since the "shakeup atop the office of Director of National Intelligence," now run by acting spy chief Richard Grenell.
It marked a stark turnaround for Schiff, who only hours earlier defended the briefing in a Twitter exchange with Trump.
Trump tweeted that there was "another Russia, Russia, Russia meeting," adding that it was "headed up by corrupt politician Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, so I wouldn’t expect too much!”
“Mr. President, you are wrong. As usual. Today’s briefing for all House Members focuses on the threat of foreign interference in our election,” Schiff tweeted in response. “The briefers are agency heads and senior officials. They are your own people. We will insist on the truth, whether you like it or not.”

Last month, the intelligence community disputed information the media were given about a classified House Intelligence Committee briefing in February, with officials denying that lawmakers were told that Russia is attempting to help Trump get reelected in 2020.

“We cannot comment on classified briefings, but what we can tell you is that Shelby did not say Russia is aiding the reelection of President Trump,” a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the Washington Examiner.
That controversial classified briefing took place on Feb. 13 and was conducted in part by Shelby Pierson, the election threats executive under then-acting DNI Joseph Maguire. Officials from the FBI, CIA, and NSA were also present. According to sources cited by the New York Times, Pierson warned that “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected.”
But NBC News cited officials who said the “misinformation and controversy" stemmed from reports that were “an overstatement, fueled, they believe, by a misinterpretation by some Democratic lawmakers on the committee.”
That echoed denials by a national security official cited by CNN’s Jake Tapper.
“The problem is, Shelby said they developed a preference for Trump,” Tapper’s source said. “A more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference; it's a step short of that.”
The official added, “It's more that they understand the president is someone they can work with," “not that they prefer him over” his Democratic opponents.
CNN further reported an intelligence official said Pierson's characterization was “misleading” while a national security official said she didn’t provide proper “nuance.”
Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien repeatedly insisted that he had not seen any intelligence to show Russia was doing anything to try to get Trump reelected.

Earlier in February, FBI Director Christopher Wray declined to confirm or deny whether the Russians were backing any particular candidate but said, “The efforts to sow discord on both sides of an issue and to generate controversy and to generate distrust in our democratic institutions on our election process, that is very much ongoing.”
“It happened in 2016, and it’s been continuing ever since then,” Wray said of Russia’s disinformation efforts. “It may have an uptick during an election cycle, but it’s a 24/7, 365 days a year threat.”

Last month, the Washington Post also reported Sen. Bernie Sanders was told by U.S. officials the Russian government was attempting to interfere in the Democratic primaries to his benefit. The vague “Russian assistance” effort was relayed to Trump and lawmakers, according to unnamed sources.
“I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president,” Sanders said in response. “My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and, as president, I will make sure that you do.”

Texto completo: A new disease likely stemming from Chinese people eating undomesticated animals is rapidly spreading and has resulted in some deaths. This is a bad thing. But let’s get a grip.
Here are symptoms of the common norovirus, a brutal stomach virus, as stated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain.
And here are the symptoms of the new coronavirus: fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
If you’re under 65, in decent health, and had to choose which one of those you’d want to be infected with, all signs indicate you should go with the latter.
The treatment for both is the same in the vast majority of cases, which is essentially to avoid contact with others, drink plenty of fluids, and wait it out. Of course, if symptoms intensify, professionals may have to administer care to aid with breathing and hydration. But "most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment,” according to the World Health Organization.
People die from both viruses. The CDC says there are up to 800 deaths per year related to the norovirus, though that’s a tiny number when you consider than there are 21 million cases.
Early data on the fatality rate of the coronavirus, which is more similar to the flu, suggest it may be a more deadly illness. Out of more than 116,000 cases recorded worldwide, there have been over 4,000 deaths. But the record is woefully incomplete, and we don’t know how many people worldwide have actually been infected. Many of those people, perhaps most, won’t ever get tested and will get well on their own.
We know very little about the individual cases in the United States, a country of nearly 330 million people, where there have been 747 diagnosed cases. Of those infected, 26 so far have died, and according to the New York Times, those patients were above 65, other than one man who was in his 40s.
In that case, however, the patient may have had underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart issues, or diabetes, which the World Health Organization says can advance the infection and exacerbate symptoms. If and when the federal government releases more information, we'll have a better idea of what any of the fatality rates look like.
None of this sounds very alarming, and yet, thanks to hyperventilating news coverage that gives the public the impression that this is in every case a life-threatening illness, the financial markets are quaking, and people are shutting themselves indoors.
In addition to the media’s panicked coverage are journalists' convulsions over the way people talk about the virus, which did originate in China — specifically a dirty seafood market in the city of Wuhan.
After Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy referred to the virus as “the Chinese coronavirus,” MSNBC anchor Ayman Mohyeldin on Tuesday called it “very derogatory” and “obviously very insensitive terminology.”
So in addition to shaking the country into a fevered nightmare about a fairly unremarkable, flu-like illness, the media are now sprinkling their usual flakes of racism accusations on top.
No wonder the country, along with the rest of the world, is having an anxiety attack about potentially suffering a throat tickle.
We obviously should be doing everything within reason to prevent the spread of the virus. But all evidence suggests that we didn’t have to interrupt our lives, let alone our entire global economy, any more than by washing our hands a few more times and wiping down the things we touch.

The Left has one problem with Trump's FEC nominee: He's a Republican

Texto completo: In politics, you’re often damned if you do and damned if you don’t. The attacks at Tuesday’s confirmation hearing for President Trump’s FEC nominee, Trey Trainor, are a reminder that some people can never be satisfied.
Since September, campaign finance “reform” groups have been screaming that democracy is in peril. The Federal Election Commission lost its quorum that month with the resignation of Republican commissioner Matt Petersen. Only three commissioners, two Democratic appointees and one Republican, remain at the six-member agency, which is structured to have three Republicans and three Democrats. All three still serving are “holdover” commissioners, meaning that their statutory terms have expired, but they remain in office until their replacements are nominated and confirmed. The lack of a quorum means that the FEC cannot write new rules, open new investigations, or offer advice to speakers on how to comply with the law.
With no FEC quorum, groups on the Left have stoked fears that the 2020 election will be a “Wild West.” One said that failing to restore the quorum in an election year “would court disaster,” another claimed it would encourage election interference from Russia, and a former Democratic commissioner said that, without a quorum, “there’s no reason ... to abide by rules.”
These fears range from overblown to ridiculous. No candidate stopped reporting donors or abiding by contribution limits when the FEC lost its quorum. Candidates know what the FEC’s critics try not to admit: Violations committed now can and will be prosecuted after a quorum is restored.
Even when the FEC is fully staffed, the civil enforcement process, like, we should note, the enforcement process in most government agencies and courts, can take years to deliver a final decision. So, it’s not like anyone is getting a free pass for their campaign activities over the last six months. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice remains responsible for investigating and prosecuting all criminal violations of campaign finance laws.
The FEC’s lack of a quorum does, however, cause some real problems. The commission’s inability to publish advisory opinions leaves some groups in the dark about how their election-year activities are regulated and delays commission rule-makings.
Ironically, the holdup in filling the vacancies and replacing the commissioners on expired terms has been the refusal of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to put forward Democratic nominees.
Finally, in frustration, Senate Republicans last week moved forward Trainor’s nomination, which has been pending since 2017. While not returning the FEC to its full six-member contingent, Trainor’s confirmation will restore the FEC’s balance to two Republicans and two Democrats and give it the bare minimum for a quorum.
In response, the groups crying bloody murder over the FEC’s lack of a quorum changed their talking points from, “Restore the quorum!” to, “Not this Republican!”
At the hearing, Schumer questioned Trainor’s “fitness to carry out the commission’s anti-corruption mandate” due to his “long career as a conservative political operative.”
Well, yes, Trainor is a Republican nominee.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Trainor “doesn’t believe in the basic campaign finance law.” Meredith McGehee, executive director of a “reform” group called Issue One, said in a statement that placing Trainor on the FEC “will only make matters worse,” adding that Trainor “does not think we should enforce the nation’s campaign finance laws.”
These attacks have been lobbed at every Republican nominee for the past 20 years. “The Republican commissioners don’t want to enforce the law,” former Democratic FEC Commissioner Ann Ravel complained to the New York Times in 2015. In 2008, McGehee, then working for the Campaign Legal Center, criticized the nomination of Republican Don McGahn, saying, “Don’t bet on tough and fair enforcement from this fellow.”
As far back as 1999, when I was nominated to serve on the FEC, the Brennan Center for Justice said that, if I got my way, “the FEC, and its state counterparts, would go out of business.” Twenty years later, the FEC and all those state agencies are still chugging along.
In reality, commissioners sometimes disagree about aspects of the law and policy. Although these disagreements tend to fall along Republican and Democratic lines, they don’t reflect partisanship so much as different views of empirical data and good policy, as well as differing theories of statutory interpretation and the proper role of administrative agencies when Congress has not spoken. Campaign finance law has produced some of the longest and most fractured Supreme Court decisions in history.
The FEC is tasked with administering the law’s finer points, so it’s not surprising that there is disagreement in this complicated field. But the Schumers and McGehees of the world routinely spout the calumny that anyone who disagrees with their strained interpretations of the law, which have been regularly rejected by federal courts, simply “doesn’t believe in enforcing the law” and, if nominated to the commission, would violate their oath of office to enforce the law.
But, as the FEC’s then-Republican commissioners explained to Politico in 2013, “Aggressive enforcement in cases where the law is vague or complicated undermines the rule of law. … Charges that the agency 'does not enforce the law' ignore the legal parameters set by Congress that have been further limited by the courts.”
The narrative that the FEC is toothless is just nonsense. My organization, the Institute for Free Speech, has successfully sued the FEC for overreaching, and the famed Citizens United decision may never have happened had the FEC not made the aggressive decision to treat a documentary film like a campaign ad.
Trainor’s sins here are: a) being a Republican and b) holding typical Republican views when it comes to interpreting the complex labyrinth of campaign finance law. The opposition to Trainor shows that these groups never really cared about restoring the FEC’s quorum. Rather, they want to destroy the FEC’s bipartisan structure.
These partisans regularly push bills to eliminate the FEC and transfer its responsibilities to a new agency with a partisan majority under the direct control of the president, beginning, of course, after Trump’s term. These are not advocates for a functioning FEC. The opposition to Trainor’s nomination comes from advocates of partisan, liberal control of the FEC.
Bradley A. Smith is chairman of the Institute for Free Speech and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission.

'Mortality rate is shocking': Healthcare industry warns against visiting nursing homes amid coronavirus outbreak

Texto completo: The healthcare industry urged nursing and assisted living homes to dissuade people from visiting those facilities amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Elderly people are far more likely to die from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, than younger adults and children. In China, roughly 1 in 5 patients over the age of 80 dies from the disease, according to the World Health Organization.
Officials with the American Health Care Association, a healthcare industry group, told healthcare facilities that treat many elderly individuals to discourage visitors and bar federal officials from entering the facility unless they need to, according to the New York Times.
"The mortality rate is shocking," AHCA President Mark Parkinson said. Parkinson’s warning comes after COVID-19 killed 18 residents at a long-term care facility in Kirkland, Washington.
The coronavirus "is one of the most significant, if not the most significant" problem the modern healthcare industry has ever faced, Parkinson said.
AHCA’s chief medical officer, David Gifford, said government officials visiting facilities and even staff workers at the facilities should not enter the buildings unless absolutely necessary and should take precautionary measures if they do. All visitors should be thoroughly screened and turned away if they have any signs of illness.

Texto completo: How did the political left squander the opportunity that was the 2020 primary campaign?
The Trump presidency has created tremendous energy among progressives. More than half of Democratic voters now identify as liberal. Most favor “Medicare for All.” A growing number are unhappy with American capitalism.
This year’s campaign offered the prospect of transformational change, with a Democratic nominee who was more liberal than any in more than a half-century. Instead, the nominee now seems likely to be a moderate white grandfather who first ran for president more than 30 years ago and whose campaign promises a return to normalcy.
True, Bernie Sanders could make a comeback, but it would need to be a big one. Among people who voted on Super Tuesday itself — rather than voting early, before Joe Biden won South Carolina — Biden trounced Sanders. The race would have to change fundamentally for Sanders to win.
If he doesn’t, the obvious questions for progressives is what went wrong and how they can do better in the future. I think there are some clear answers — empirical answers that anybody, regardless of ideology, should be able to see. I’d encourage the next generation of progressive leaders to think about these issues with an open mind.
The biggest lesson is simply this: The American left doesn’t care enough about winning.
It’s an old problem, one that has long undermined left-wing movements in this country. They have often prioritized purity over victory. They wouldn’t necessarily put it these terms, but they have chosen to lose on their terms rather than win with compromise.
You can see this pattern today in the ways that many progressive activists misread public opinion. Their answer to almost every question of political strategy is to insist that Americans are a profoundly progressive people who haven’t yet been inspired to vote the way they think. The way to win, these progressives claim, is to go left, always.
Immigration? Most Americans want more of it. Abortion? This is a pro-choice country. Fracking? People now understand its downsides. Strict gun control? Affirmative action? A wealth tax? Free college? Medicare for All? Widely available marijuana? Americans want it all, activists claim.
This belief helps explain why so many 2020 candidates hoping to win the progressive vote — including Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris — embraced ideas like a ban on fracking and the decriminalization of the border. The left persuaded itself that those policies were both morally righteous and politically savvy. To reject any one of them was to risk being labeled a neoliberal sellout.
The thing is, progressive activists are right about public opinion on some of these issues. Most Americans do favor higher taxes on the rich, marijuana legalization and additional gun control. But too many progressives aren’t doing an honest analysis of the politics. They are instead committing what journalist Matthew Yglesias has called “the pundit fallacy.” They are conflating their own opinions with smart political advice. They are choosing to believe what they want to believe.
They often do so by pointing to polls with favorably worded, intricate questions — and by ignoring evidence to the contrary. Affirmative action, for example, typically loses ballot initiatives. Polls show that most Americans favor some abortion restrictions and oppose the elimination of private health insurance.
By designing campaign strategies for the America they want, rather than the one that exists, progressives have done a favor to their political opponents. They have refused to make tactical retreats, which is why they keep losing.
I think Warren may have been the person most damaged by this dynamic in 2020. (And, yes, she was also hurt by sexism.) She could have positioned herself as the candidate who excited much of the left but was more acceptable to the center-left than Sanders. Instead, she mimicked Sanders, making many Democratic voters who were rooting for her worried that, like him, she couldn’t win a general election.
Or look back at the 2018 midterms. In competitive districts, candidates backed by progressive groups like Justice Democrats and Our Revolution were shut out. They lost in either the primaries or the general election. There isn’t a single Sanders-like member of Congress from a purple or red district. There are dozens of moderates.
Remember: The policy positions of Sanders, Warren and other progressives — on Medicare for All, for instance — are often closer to the views of most Democratic voters than the moderate position is. Yet many Democrats spurn the progressive candidate. These voters care more about winning than about perfect policy agreement, and they support the candidate whom they (correctly) see as more in tune with the full electorate.
The progressive wing of the party has still had a good few years, pushing the party left in multiple ways. Even Biden’s platform is strikingly liberal. But if progressives aren’t satisfied being influential runners-up, I would suggest three broad principles.
First, don’t become PINOs (progressives in name only). Decide on a few core ways in which you think moderate Democrats are wrong, and stake out different positions.
Second, stop believing your own spin. Analyze public opinion objectively. Acknowledge when a progressive position brings electoral costs.
Finally, start testing some new political strategies. A single break with orthodoxy can send a larger signal. It can make a candidate look flexible, open-minded, less partisan and more respectful of people with different views.
Maybe the new approach should involve economic progressivism and cultural moderation, which happens to reflect American public opinion. Maybe it involves a different approach on immigration — insisting on a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally but also a slowdown of future immigration. Maybe it means announcing that fracking and nuclear energy are crucial to fighting climate change. Or maybe it involves finding more progressive candidates who hunt or talk about their relationship with Jesus Christ and have some related policy positions.
I realize that political compromise usually feels unpleasant. But I’d ask: How does losing feel?
As luck would have it, the Democratic Party has a loyal group of voters who, though hardly monolithic, tend to be more pragmatic and less wishful than progressive activists. They also tend to be culturally moderate, as many swing voters are.
This group, of course, is black voters, especially those middle-aged and older. They just swung the 2020 nomination away from Sanders and toward Biden. Until progressives figure out how to do better with black voters, they are going to have a hard time winning. And the same strategies that will help progressives win more black voters in the primaries are also likely to win over more swing voters in a general election.

Texto completo: The United States is one of the only rich countries not requiring employers to give their workers paid time off when they’re sick. It has become an urgent issue for more Americans because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Citing the crisis, Democrats in Congress are trying to pass a new version of a sick leave bill that has been stalled in Congress since 2004 — and expand it to add 14 days of immediately accessible paid sick leave in the case of a public health emergency.
An economics study released Monday offers an idea of what might happen if the bill passed. It’s the biggest study of the effects of state sick leave laws in the United States. In states that mandated sick leave, it found, fewer employees worked when sick. On average, they took two additional sick days a year. And the cost to employers who began offering sick leave after the laws passed was relatively small.
“Right now, the experts are telling people: Stay home if you’re sick,” said Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington and a sponsor of the new bill.
But many workers, including those in the service industry, cannot follow the advice without losing a paycheck, she said.
“That’s why paid sick days are such a critical part of this response,” Murray said.
Republicans have generally not supported a paid sick leave mandate, but Monday night, President Donald Trump said he would be meeting with congressional leaders to discuss relief for workers. Officials said the ideas include a payroll tax cut, small business loans and legislation intended to protect hourly wage earners who may have to miss work because of the spread of the virus.
U.S. workers have unequal access to paid sick leave. One in four workers has no access, according to Labor Department data. That includes 6% of the highest earners and two-thirds of the lowest earners. Forty percent of workers in service jobs, like those in restaurants, shops or child care centers, have no paid sick time.
Murray and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., are sponsors of a bill that would enable workers to accrue up to seven days of sick time. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, they introduced a bill that would also require that employers of any size offer paid sick leave (previously it was only those with 15 or more employees), and that they give an additional 14 days in a public health emergency.
On Sunday, the Democratic leaders in Congress, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, called for a range of health measures, including paid sick leave for workers under quarantine or whose children were out of school because of coronavirus.
Under the bill, employers would be responsible for paying for the sick time; there would be no tax increase. Other policymakers have said they were considering assistance, like loans or grants, for small businesses coping with employees and customers staying home during the outbreak.
In the new study of the effects of sick leave, researchers analyzed what happened in five states and Washington, D.C., before and after they passed sick leave laws, and compared this with states that didn’t pass laws. They used data on 400,000 employees from 2009 to 2017, from the Labor Department’s National Compensation Survey, which tracks wages and benefits reported by employers. (Previous studies have generally relied on surveys of employees about whether they took it.)
On average, employees in states that passed sick leave took two more sick days a year, or 16 hours of sick time. Eight in 10 employers offered it after the laws took effect, an increase of 20% (some did not comply with the law.) The average cost to employers that started offering it was 20 cents per hour worked.
The study, published as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also found that paid sick leave laws didn’t reduce employment or wage growth, and didn’t have unintended consequences of reducing other benefits, like vacation time or disability pay.
The researchers used a standard economic model to try to assess how the policy affected employers’ and workers’ well-being: things like health, income and profit. They determined that workers were healthier and better off. Employers might benefit in other ways they couldn’t measure, they said, like improved productivity and morale among employees, and a decreased chance of sickness spreading in the workplace.
“Maximizing profits can often lead to an outcome that is less than the best outcome for society,” said Johanna Catherine Maclean, an economist at Temple, who wrote the paper with Nicolas Ziebarth of Cornell and Stefan Pichler of the KOF Swiss Economic Institute. “We find that when we think about that collective well-being, society is better off after the mandates than before the mandates.”

Valerie M. Hudson: What you do to women, you do to your nation

Texto completo: In 1995, the U.N. World Conference for Women in Beijing championed the idea that the fate of nations was tied to the status and of their female citizens. In 2000, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 asserted that peace is inextricably linked with gender equality.
This year, as we approach the conference’s 25th anniversary and the resolution’s 20th anniversary, research has only emphasized that what was said then still holds true today: Violence against women and women’s subordination are not simply problems of the home and family. We now know, for example, that the prevalence of violence against women in a country can be a predictor of a national predilection toward terrorism and civil conflict. That’s why 83 countries have created national action plans on women, peace and security.
Great strides have been made for women since 1995. Globally, maternal mortality has plummeted at least 45 percent, primary school enrollment for boys and girls is at virtual parity, and the percentage of women represented in national legislatures has more than doubled.
These gains are not unalloyed: Decreased maternal mortality comes primarily as a result of the gains of one country, China; girls lag boys in graduating from primary school; and women fill only approximately 24.5% of legislative seats, with some bodies still having no female representation at all. But still, measurable progress.
At the same time, we also see troubling indications that old evils are making a comeback. Whether we speak of attempts to ban almost all abortions, even in the case of rape or incest, here in the United States, or debates about legalizing polygyny in Central Asia, or that in 2015, three times the number of nations had abnormal childhood sex ratios favoring males than was the case 20 years prior, clearly the world cannot assume progress for women will be steady and straightforward. Furthermore, some harms seem perennial, such as domestic violence, sexual harassment and sex trafficking.
While we might be tempted to see all of this as a human interest sideshow to the high politics of the world, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it is time to say again what was said in Beijing a quarter-century ago: The fate of nations is tied to the status of women. In a new study, my co-authors and I demonstrate that nearly every dimension of national security is intertwined with whether women are subordinated or empowered within their society. (Remarkably, the Department of Defense funded this study in order to better anticipate instability abroad — a sign that at least some in the security establishment have begun taking these links seriously.)
We have found that household-level practices in many countries subordinate women even when they are educated, even when they are in the labor force, even when they serve in government. One of the most crucial conversations I ever had was with a female member of the Afghan legislature, the loya jirga. She was university-educated and had a career — and yet, she asked, how empowered was she, really, if her husband could divorce her simply by saying so, and she would lose custody of her children and have nowhere to live if he did?
Surely it gives one pause that Saudi women have the same rates of university education as German women yet are still subject to male guardianship over certain aspects of their lives. Or that Rwanda has the highest female labor force participation rates as well as the highest percentage of women in the national parliament in the world even as family law and property rights there are often governed by traditions that favor men.
This means we need to examine the things that constrain women in their homes, in their personal lives — high levels of violence against women and impunity for their assailants, lack of property and inheritance rights, laws that favor men in divorce and child custody cases, polygyny, bride prices, dowries. These practices constitute the first political order of any society. The structure of the relationship between the two halves of humanity is the basis for the political order of every nation, and if that order allows autocracy, violence and extortion, a nation will arc in those directions as well.
This is not philosophical, this is practical. Studies have shown that men who hold that women are inferiors are much more likely to engage in political violence. They are also much more likely to be hostile to minorities and foreigners. If household governance is by male fiat, no wonder government winds up autocratic, ineffective and corrupt. The household is the training ground: Men are trained in the practices they will use when they gain societal power.
Societies that subordinate women also find themselves saddled with chronic destabilization caused by the practices that produce that subordination. If sex-selective abortion has culled 12 percent of 15 percent of the females in a society, as has happened in China and India, national instability follows. When bride prices go through the roof, terrorist groups discover they can gain recruits by promising money for bride prices and even brides to young men.
In sum, the law of the first political order is this: What you do to your women, you do to your nation.
Examining 122 outcome variables capturing nine dimensions of national security including governance, conflict, economic performance, health and environmental preservation, my co-authors and I have found that the first political order is both highly significant and displays the largest or second-largest explanatory power for outcomes.
So, yes, by all means create an Office of Global Women’s Empowerment in the State Department, as recent legislation has done. But there is much more to do, and it starts at home. The to-do list includes refusing to erode women’s hard-won reproductive rights, and ensuring women can combine reproduction and production. It also means refusing to redefine household-level subordinative practices, such as polygamy, as just another lifestyle choice, as well as understanding domestic violence for what it really is — a form of terrorism which must be treated as such under the law.
Curse your women, and you curse your nation. And you curse our world with all the instability caused as a result.

Charles M. Blow: You can’t gaslight a virus

Texto completo: In the Donald Trump era, Democrats and Republicans generally live with two completely different concepts of reality. Their views of Trump, his competence and character, could hardly be more different.
The Pew Research Center last week released the results of a poll that found that an overwhelming majority of Republicans and independents who lean Republican viewed Trump as intelligent. After all, he describes himself as “a very stable genius.” Maybe they believe him. Maybe they see his business dealings and political maneuvering — no matter how shady — and his ability to avoid major punishment as markers of brilliance.
But, they are largely alone on that island. Only 19% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents view Trump as intelligent.
Furthermore, 71% of Republicans and Republican-leaners believe that Trump is honest, even though he has single-handedly provided a jolt of energy and a shield of job security to fact-checkers.
As The Washington Post wrote in January:
“Three years after taking the oath of office, President Trump has made more than 16,200 false or misleading claims — a milestone that would have been unthinkable when we first created the Fact Checker’s database that analyzes, categorizes and tracks every suspect statement he has uttered.”
Trump is a lying machine. It is pathological. It is compulsive. It is unrepentant.
Democrats and their leaners see this, as only 7% view Trump as honest.
Sixty-two percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents see Trump as morally upstanding. This is a thrice married man whom multiple women have accused of sexual misconduct, and at least one has accused of rape. This is a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women, who was outed for paying off women who claimed to have had extramarital affairs with him, and who has appeared (clothed, thankfully) in at least three soft-core pornographic films.
Again, precious few Democrats and their leaners agreed with this assessment of Trump’s morality.
But perhaps most telling to me was that 87% of Republicans and their leaners say that Trump fights for what they believe in, while at the same time 35% say that he is prejudiced. There is clearly some overlap here. Allow that to sink it.
Some people don’t like him in spite of his prejudices but because of them, because they share them.
But, there were a couple of areas of general agreement among Democrats and Republicans, one of which was that overwhelming majorities of both groups viewed Trump as self-centered.
That self-centered sensibility has been on full display since the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Trump sees this budding pandemic through the lens of how it will affect him and his reelection prospects. The fact that the people infected and those fearful of becoming so are real people who desperately need the steady hand of a steady leader is lost on him.
Instead of being the president that the country needs in a time of crisis, he has chosen to employ his worn political strategy: lying. Rather than addressing the issue straightforwardly, he has told lie after lie, and in some cases contradicted the scientists trying to manage this issue.
This has real-world consequences for people’s health and the management of the virus’s spread. As a Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found, “Democrats are about twice as likely as Republicans to say the coronavirus poses an imminent threat to the United States,” and “More Democrats than Republicans say they are taking steps to be prepared, including washing their hands more often or limiting their travel plans.”
Furthermore, when asked last week if he would consider canceling some of his large political rallies to avoid the risk of spreading the virus, Trump responded, “It doesn’t bother me and it doesn’t bother them at all.”
Trump could be making his most ardent supporters a petri dish of disease.
But in his mind, it’s not really about them, and certainly not about the rest of us. This is about him, only, always.
Whereas his supporters can be lied to and gaslighted, a virus cannot. A virus is going to do what a virus does. Viruses are not thinking and aware. Technically, they’re not even living things. They are like an army of androids, multiplying as they attack and infect living things.
So none of the tricks that Trump has learned and deployed will work against this virus. Only science, honesty, prudence and genuine concern for public safety will work now.
And precisely for those reasons, this virus exposes Trump’s enormous weaknesses as the chief executive officer of this country.
The public needs to be assured that we have a real leader at the helm, but we are being shown that just the opposite is true. The fact that he wants to spin media coverage of the virus as politically motivated, the fact that he keeps lowballing the number of people infected, and the fact that he has said that the virus may miraculously disappear, all show that Trump is as much a public health threat as the virus itself.

FINGER ON THE PULSE TECH COMPANIES CAN TRACK YOUR PANICKY CORONAVIRUS SEARCHES

Texto completo: Several weeks ago, Sand Hill Road VC firm Andreessen Horowitz received some heckling after posting a "No Handshakes" notice on their front entrance. Coronavirus cases were still rare outside of China, and it was easy to dismiss the precautions as symptomatic of Silicon Valley's heightened self-importance.
Now that multiple U.S. cities have declared a state of emergency, it may be worth considering the decisions of those who spend their days analyzing massive troves of user data - and considering whether that data might be used to draw any conclusions about the virus now known as COVID-19.
Amazon was one of the first companies to withdraw from last month's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona over coronavirus concerns. Amazon ships products to over 100 countries around the world, so it's not surprising that they would be ahead of the curve in predicting disease outbreaks. Just follow the flow of face masks and hand sanitizer. According to Amazon price tracking site camelcamelcamel, the prices of Purell hand sanitizer and disposable masks began to rise around the end of January, a reflection of the impact of supply and demand on automated pricing algorithms.
Then there's Facebook, which tracks the interests, relationships and real-time physical location of 2.4 billion users. (Don't worry, we consented to this when we clicked "Agree" on the terms of service pop-up window.) It's not too much of a stretch to say that the popularity of Facebook Groups may have given the company some insight on the state of global gatherings. Late last month, the company confirmed the cancellation of the annual F8 developers conference, originally scheduled to take place in May in San Jose, Calif.
Google keeps track of user location as well as global traffic flows through its mapping service. On top of that, the search engine fields 3.5 billion queries a day, many of which are health-related search requests from consumers seeking medical advice. Searches for pneumonia, for example, reached an all-time high in January of this year. Google's decision to cancel an internal conference in Vegas and move its upcoming Cloud Next event to a virtual gathering may be better-informed than the guidance issued by our own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It's hard to deny big tech companies the right to apply proprietary data analysis to protect the health of employees and customers, if that's indeed what's happening. It'll be even harder to prevent the government from demanding access to the same information for public health planning. We already saw this happen in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, when the USA Patriot Act authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies to engage in mass surveillance. Widespread panic, whether from terrorism or pandemic, provides a handy excuse to erode civil liberties.
What will happen if the government asks mobile phone carriers to share location data? AT&T and Verizon (who both canceled their participation in last month's RSA conference in San Francisco) were recently fined for failing to safeguard information about customers' real-time locations. Both carriers were previously revealed to have assisted the NSA in warrantless wiretapping.
To see how this might play out, look to Asia. Singapore's Ministry of Health has provided enough information for local citizens to create a website tracking the movement and status of individual cases. Such transparency may be reassuring to the public, but it's also a potential violation of patient privacy.
In China, mobile phone apps such as AliPay and WeChat are used by the government to track people's interactions and perform contact tracing. China has accomplished impressive containment measures, but few Americans aspire to turn the country into China.
Mass surveillance, of course, is not the only solution. Genomic epidemiology, which examines how viruses mutate and accumulate changes during the course of transmission, may be a decent predictor of disease spread. Better distribution of test kits will certainly fill information gaps and help the public manage disease risk.
So far the CDC has been remarkably inadequate on COVID-19 testing, forcing employers into a collective action problem - no one wants to be the first to scale back business interests. Several of the biggest U.S. banks have restricted nonessential international travel. In San Francisco, Square, Twitter, Stripe and Coinbase have all urged employees to work from home. Maybe it's time for the rest of us to consider following their lead.

Texto completo: Dayton’s largest theater organization revealed a new name and logo and announced a 2020-21 lineup that includes Disney’s “The Lion King,” Tina Fey’s “Mean Girls” and “Jesus Christ Superstar” during a special open house on Tuesday, March 10.
The organization known as the Victoria Theatre Association has morphed into Dayton Live.
The functions of the former ticketing site TicketCenterStage and the association’s site VictoriaThreatre.com have been merged into the much sleeker looking DaytonLive.org.
Tickets for the following shows to be staged at the Schuster Center are now on sale on DaytonLive.org: “ Come From Away, ” Oct. 6 to 11; “Anastasia,” Nov. 3 to 8; “Mean Girls,” Nov. 24 to 29; “ Jesus Christ Superstar, ” Jan 12 to 17, 2021; “Fiddler on the Roof, ” Feb. 9 to 14, 2021; “The Band’s Visit, ” March 9 to 14, 2021 and “The Lion King ,” May 6 to 23, 2021.
The first of the Projects Unlimited Star Attraction productions planned for the Victoria Theatre were also announced: “ Cirque Dreams Holidaze ,” Dec. 14 to 24 and Dec. 26 and 27 and “Stomp,” April 9 to 11.
In a statement, Ty Sutton , the organization’s president and CEO, said Dayton Live “evokes the energy of live events while boldly declaring that our thriving downtown community is the region's home for arts, culture and entertainment.”
After months of research and conversations with audience members, Real Art, a Dayton-based design and marking firm, was selected to develop the brand and new website in May.
“We found our brand didn't really reflect the many activities we promote or venues we operate as an organization,” Sutton said. “Dayton Live is a vibrant brand under which all of our venues and community partners will be able to grow."
"Ticket buyers can search DaytonLive.org by performance name, art form, date and a list of presenting organizations that includes Dayton Ballet, Dayton Philharmonic, Dayton Opera, The Human Race Theatre Company and Muse Machine.
Dayton Live is the only authorized seller for its venues: Schuster Center, Victoria Theatre, PNC Arts Annex, and The Loft Theatre.

Texto completo: At a debate last month, Bernie Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination were asked if they were concerned about the party possibly graduating a democratic socialist to the general election. The only ones who made their worry perfectly clear were Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar.
That’s when Sanders won the Democratic primary.
At debates before then, some candidates went out of their way to describe what they’d accomplished or were proposing as “progressive,” especially if they were being maligned as (gulp) moderates.
“Look, we all have big progressive plans,” Biden said, as if to reassure Democratic voters. Michael Bennet touted bipartisan immigration legislation that he helped to write as “the most progressive DREAM Act” ever put together.
That’s when Sanders won the Democratic primary.
He won it when his rivals talked more about whether “Medicare for All” could ever get through Congress than about whether such a huge expansion of the federal government was a good idea in the first place. He won it when they competed to throw many more trillions than the next candidate at climate change. He won it when the disagreement became not about free tuition at public colleges but about the eligibility of students from families above a certain income level.
He and his supporters shouldn’t feel defeated after Super Tuesday. They should take a bow.
Sanders had a disappointing showing, yes, and Biden emerged as the likeliest Democratic nominee. That prompted lamentations from Sanders’ fans that the status quo was prevailing, the revolution was being dashed, and the Democratic Party was mired in squishy moderation.
Nonsense. In the context of previous presidential elections, Biden isn’t so very moderate. Nor are Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg or other Democratic aspirants lumped in that category. They have carved out positions to the left of the party’s nominees over the past two decades, including the most recent three: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Kerry.
And you know who gets the most credit for that? Sanders. The runner-up is Elizabeth Warren, who remains in the race spiritually if not physically, having also planted and cultivated ideas that spread far beyond her. Mike Bloomberg’s advocacy of a 5% surtax on incomes of over $5 million annually spoke to the pressure that her signature “wealth tax” put on Democrats to address how they would rein in huge fortunes. There was more attention to that issue in this Democratic primary than in primaries past.
While Sanders’ fellow candidates didn’t parrot his vocabulary and denounce “oligarchs” and “oligarchy,” they spoke expansively about gross income inequality and the need to tackle it. That largely reflected how wealth had been concentrated over recent decades. But it owed something, too, to Sanders’ right and righteous demand that America have this conversation.
Biden’s proposed tax increases of about $3.4 trillion over a decade are more than double what Clinton was advocating in 2016, while Buttigieg’s were more than quadruple. How is that moderate?
The scare that Sanders put into Clinton four years ago and the organization that he built have transformed the party, moving it even further left than the questionable electoral successes of his movement justify. Although there is scant evidence in recent elections that a Democrat running on Sanders’ platform can win anywhere but in decidedly blue districts and states, that platform colored the Democratic primary in a bold and indelible way. Candidates disrespected it at their peril.
As the Democratic race narrowed to about half a dozen plausible contenders, Klobuchar asserted herself — and was frequently characterized as — a sort of common-sense centrist. But her actual positions and proposals told a different story. As my fellow New York Times Op-Ed columnist David Leonhardt recently wrote: “She wants to raise taxes on the rich, break up monopolies, vastly expand Medicare, fight climate change, admit more refugees, allow undocumented immigrants to become citizens, ban assault weapons and require universal background checks. A Klobuchar administration would probably be well to the left of the Obama administration.” It would be closer to Sanders territory.
“All the lead contenders are running on the most progressive agendas to ever dominate a Democratic primary,” wrote Vox’s Ezra Klein and Roge Karma late last year. They noted that this primary’s moderates would have been considered leftists in the recent past. “As a result,” they added, “if Biden or Buttigieg actually win the nomination, they will be running on the most progressive platform of any Democratic nominee in history.”
Buttigieg was designated a moderate despite his support for abolishing the Electoral College and expanding the Supreme Court, both of which would be profound changes in American politics and governance.
Biden was designated a moderate despite declaring that the Equality Act, which would offer sweeping federal protection against discrimination for LGBTQ people, didn’t merely have his support; it would be his top legislative priority. He was designated a moderate despite being among the 10 candidates at a Democratic debate early on who all raised their hands when asked if they supported extending health care benefits to immigrants in the country illegally.
He was designated a moderate despite calling for an expansion of Obamacare — including the addition of a Medicare-like public insurance option — that would cost $750 billion over a decade; despite his desire to spend another $750 billion on education; despite a $1.7 trillion climate plan.
All that spending: I’m struck by how infrequently and wanly Democratic candidates have mentioned fiscal responsibility, deficits or debt. In prior elections, candidates talked some about that to avoid being tagged as naively starry-eyed liberals. But the sky was the limit this time around. Sure, Sanders’ rivals ultimately grilled him on his math, suggesting that his particular plans were ruinously lavish. But enormous spending as an idea was seldom if ever under attack. In fact, it was in vogue.
And Sanders’ grilling was a long time coming. The wonder of most of the debates was how carefully his competitors tiptoed around him, acutely conscious of the moral force that he had come to wield in the party and the passion of his supporters, whom they didn’t want to alienate. He became the enemy that no Democrat wanted to have.
On the day after Super Tuesday, when Biden won 10 of 14 states, including a few where Sanders had beaten Clinton in the 2016 primary, Sanders asked, “Does anyone seriously believe that a president backed by the corporate world is going to bring about the changes in this country that working families and the middle class and lower-income people desperately want?”
Well, yeah, I do. Biden won’t make all of those changes, and they may be more restrained than Sanders would like or than the situation demands. The arc of history bends toward justice — it doesn’t hurtle there.
But Biden’s backing extends well beyond corporations. His proposals demonstrate concern for those working families. And his goals echo Sanders’ goals, for one reason above all others. Sanders already won.

Texto completo: We’ve been here before, sort of. When the devastating California wildfires filled the Bay Area with smoke and sent air quality into dangerous range, we found ways to stay busy and entertained without being outside for more than a minute or two. Now, as the threat of the coronavirus grows and public venues shutter, residents are avoiding crowds, lathering themselves with hand sanitizer and — increasingly — staying home. Some are finding themselves in self-quarantine.
Fortunately, there are still plenty of relaxing and rewarding ways to spend the weekend solo, from watching top movies and reading bestsellers to catching up on household tasks. Here are 12 ideas:
1. March movie madness
Catch up on fall movies, including Oscar winners “American Factory ” (Best Documentary Feature) and “Marriage Story” (Best Supporting Actress), now on Netflix. See the best Animated Feature winner “Toy Story 4” on Disney Plus. And “Parasite,” which scored four Academy Awards, can be streamed on Google Play, Vudu and Amazon Prime. It’s also coming to Hulu on April 8.
2. Horror movie madness
In these unsettling times, there may be catharsis and consolation in watching movies that use made-up scenarios to scare us. This virus is scary, but at least there are no zombies, right? Check out “Get Out,” “A Quiet Place” and more new and classic horror flicks — here’s our top 25 horror movies of the decade guide — all available to stream/buy/rent through the usual services.
3. TV binge time
March and April bring a number of hotly anticipated TV series Among them: Alex Garland’s Silicon Valley-set sci-fi thriller “Devs” (FX on Hulu, March 5), and the latest in Nordic noir with “The Valhalla Murders” (Netflix, March 13). Season 3 of “Westworld returns to HBO on March 15, along with season 2 in “My Brilliant Friend: The Story of a New Name,” set in Italy and inspired by Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Novels (HBO, March 16).
Don’t miss “Little Fires Everywhere,” a small-town thriller starring Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington (Hulu, March 18); the miniseries biopic “Self-Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,” starring Octavia Spencer (Netflix, March 20); and season 3 of “Ozark” (Netflix, March 27). Plus, tthe black comedy “Run,” executive produced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (HBO, April 12); Cate Blanchett starring as Phyllis Schlafly in “Mrs. America” (FX on Hulu, April 15); and Season 3 of “Killing Eve” (BBC America, April 26).
4. Read a book … or three
Tuck into a recent page-turner written by a local author, like “Bottle Grove,” a comedic look at San Francisco’s hipsters and tech bros by the city’s own Lemony Snicket; “Squirrel in the Wall,” an interspecies romp by Oakland’s Hentry Hitz; or “Sourdough, or Lois and Her Adventures in the Underground Market,” by New York Times best-selling author Robin Sloan, of Oakland. It’s about an overworked software engineer who finds joy as a baker. That sourdough starter though … it’s alive.
5. Relax with music
Spend a day, or more, on Spotify/Apple music getting caught up on your listening. A home concert of the top albums of the 2010s would give you a selection that features Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Rey, Beyonce, Radiohead, Lizzo, Black Sabbath and more.
6. Finally, a little you time
Take a long warm bath, enjoy a nice cup of tea, take a nap or start writing your own novel. Now also is the perfect time for a pampering facial. Bust out that hyaluronic cream and rub on that exfoliating scrub before they both expire in your cabinet. Been neglecting your nails? Mani-pedis for everyone in the house. Even making a simple scrub — sugar, coconut oil, a few drops of essential oil — will slough away winter chapped lips and make you feel great.
7. Cook to your heart’s content
That pandemic pantry you put together is a work of art. Use it. Cook a comforting Black Bean Chili or an epic Guittard chocolate cake while your ingredient stock is fresh. Or heck, if you’re self-quarantined because someone in your home is sick, build this Bubbe-approved Chicken Soup with Matzoh Balls from San Francisco’s Wise Sons Deli.
8. Organize your home, life
Declutter your closet, go through photos and computer files, finally hang those pictures — or purge your cupboards and pantry of items you’ll never use. Spring is nearly here, so do a deep spring cleaning. For most tasks, the standard multi-cleaner you have on hand should suffice. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also says that most common household disinfectants are effective in killing the coronavirus.
9. Keep up with your workouts
If you like to exercise, but can’t get to your favorite yoga class or gym, you probably know moves you can do at home, from sun salutations to pushups. But YouTube videos and apps can help with new ideas. BuzzFeed News offers a guide to the best online yoga programs, while Women’s Health recently published a list of 17 videos that offer quick workouts or specialized programs that target your core or legs or that offer high-intensive internal training.
10. Get outdoors, home edition
Your garden probably needs some attention. Now is the time to clean up and prep beds by weeding, adding compost and repairing irrigation. You also can start seeds indoors for planting when the soil warms up in April and May. It’s also a good time to peruse online seed catalogs and start a garden journal so you can sketch out your ideas about what you’ll plant and where.
11. Get outdoors, for those free to roam
If you’re not in self-quarantine but want to avoid crowds, try nature. These 8 Bay Area hikes in local, regional, state and national parks offer plenty of spectacular, unpeopled hikes where you can enjoy more than a social distance, all while enjoying fresh air and beautiful scenery.
12. Stay social
At home, you can still stay in touch with family and friends or even re-connect with old friends you’ve lost track of. Remember when telephones were used for talking? Enjoy a long phone call with an old friend, or try FaceTime or Skype. Revive the lost art of handwriting letters or pen emails. Use social media in a positive way to engage in thoughtful discussions about your favorite books, movies and other hobbies and interests.

Texto completo: A London man revealed last year to be the second-ever person to be HIV-free has publicly identified himself.
Adam Castillejo, 40, told the New York Times he calls himself "LP" — or London Patient — and has launched a Twitter account as an "ambassador of hope" to speak about his experience and provide support to other people with HIV.
In March last year, doctors said Castillejo — who was anonymous at the time — received a bone marrow transplant intended to treat his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Castillejo was first diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and was told in 2011 that he had Stage 4 lymphoma. The cancer diagnosis affected his HIV treatment, and his HIV status complicated his cancer treatment.
Bone-marrow transplants are occasionally used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but the procedure has rarely been done with cancer patients who also have HIV.
In 2015, per the Times, he underwent an experimental bone marrow transplant with a doctor, Ian Gabriel, who works with patients who have HIV. They were able to find a donor that matched, and also had a genetic mutation known as CCR5-delta 32 that allows HIV resistance.
The process took place in 2016, and Castillejo endured a series of complications, including hearing loss and drastic weight loss.
But after months of recovery, he stopped taking his antiretroviral medication in September of 2017. Nearly three years later, the virus hasn't returned.
The treatment was not conventional, and Castillejo is still undergoing studies so that researchers can learn more about the complexities of HIV and cancer treatment.
A month before the Times story published Castillejo tweeted he hoped his case would allow for a "a more achievable cure in the future. "
The first patient to be cured of HIV, Berlin patient Timothy Ray Brown, underwent two bone-marrow transplants also for cancer treatments, took a cocktail of drugs and experienced life-threatening complications, but survived.

Texto completo: When historian Ibram X. Kendi approached him to create a “remix” of his 2016 National Book Award-winning “Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America” for young readers, Reynolds said no at first.
“I write from my imagination, from the childlike part of my psyche that I’ve been able to hold on to,” Reynolds explained in a phone interview. “This is a different beast. I was so intimidated. … But there was a moment I realized that this is bigger than me, this is bigger than him — this is something bigger than both of us that will exist when we’re long gone. If we have an opportunity to change the way people think about race, it almost feels irresponsible to not say yes.”
That yes became “Stamped: Racism, Antiracism and You” (Little, Brown, $18.99), which publishes Tuesday. Reynolds — a National Book Award finalist for “Ghost,” part of the New York Times bestselling “Track” series; a Newbery honoree for “Long Way Down”; and the new National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature — will be in Austin on Wednesday to discuss the book.
It’s a translation of Kendi’s deeply researched original, illustrating how racist ideas have reinforced inequities and discrimination throughout American history. And it was by request.
“The readers. They kept saying it. They kept saying that this book should be in every school,” Kendi said in an email interview. “They kept saying every young person should learn this history
… I wanted to transform, completely remix this book for young readers. I wanted a completely different reading experience that feels authentic to young people, that is accessible to young people, that can transform young people, that meets them where they are.”
Reynolds gets right to it in “Stamped’s” opening chapter: “This is not a history book. I repeat, this is not a history book,” he writes. “At least, not like the ones you’re used to reading in school. The ones that feel more like a list of dates (there will be some), with an occasional war here and there, a declaration (definitely gotta mention that), a constitution (that too), a court case or two, and of course, the paragraph that’s read during Black History Month (Harriet! Rosa! Martin!).”
So while there are familiar figures from more traditional renditions of history, readers will see them through a different lens: “Thomas Jefferson might have been the world’s first White person to say, ‘I have Black friends,’” Reynolds writes. It’s the same for black icons, whose nuanced depictions include both their highlights and their challenges. W.E.B. DuBois, for example, is celebrated for his support of his black compatriots and dinged for his early insistence that black success only mattered if it matched white standards.
“This is how I would explain it to my little brother, who’s 18,” Reynolds says of the book’s conversational, accessible style. “I don’t value airs. I don’t value pomp and circumstance. I value informed irreverence. Uninformed irreverence is irresponsibility. This book … helps us put young people into the conversation.”
And not just young people. Both Reynolds and Kendi say while “Stamped’s” remix is billed as a young person’s version of the original, its subject matter and style can loop in adults.
“It’s been filtered in a way so everyone can wrap their brains around it,” Reynolds says, adding that parents and their children can and should read the book together. “I think we can use this as less of a pedagogical tool and more of a conversational primer.”

Durst eyed killing brother, tape shows

Texto completo: Robert Durst's own words dogged him again Monday when jurors heard him on a recorded jail call allegedly saying he'd planned to kill his Manhattan mogul brother Douglas Durst.
"I was planning on Igor-ing BM," Durst (photo) said in the 2001 phone chat recorded by a Pennsylvania jail and played on the third day of opening statements at his Los Angeles murder trial. Deputy District Attorney John Lewin told jurors that "BM" was code for Douglas Durst and "Igor-ing" was a reference to a series of dogs belonging to Robert Durst that were all named Igor and allegedly disappeared mysteriously.
"Mr. Durst is discussing the fact that he had screwed up his plan to kill Douglas," Lewin told the jury.
Durst, 76, is on trial for allegedly murdering his best friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles in December 2000. Prosecutors claim he shot Berman in the back of her head to prevent her from telling New York authorities what she knew about the disappearance of his first wife Kathie Durst in 1982.
They claim Durst killed Kathie amid a "nasty" divorce and that he also killed and dismembered Morris Black in 2001 to keep the Texas neighbor from blowing his cover while he lived undercover as a mute woman in Galveston.
Durst was acquitted of Black's murder at trial after claiming he accidentally shot his neighbor in the face in self-defense.
Douglas Durst, now the head of the Durst family real estate empire in New York, is expected to testify at the expected five-month trial over Berman's death now underway in Los Angeles.
In a rare interview with the New York Times in 2015, Douglas said that before Kathie vanished, Robert Durst had a series of seven Alaskan Malamute dogs. He said they all disappeared, mysteriously, within six months of his older brother owning them. All of the dogs were named Igor.
"We don't know how they died, and what happened to the bodies," Douglas said. "In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing his wife with those dogs."
In a motion filed early Monday, Lewin argued for the right to bring up Durst's alleged plot to kill his brother saying it was linked to Kathie's disappearance. The judge granted the request.
The motion pointed out that when Durst jumped bail in Galveston and ended up back in custody on Nov. 30, 2001 for shoplifting a sandwich from a Pennsylvania supermarket, authorities found a note in his car that said, "What DD is doing to me puts me in the same place as what Kathy did to me."
Lewin also told jurors Monday that when he interviewed Durst in a New Orleans jail in March 2015 after his arrest on the Berman murder warrant, Durst talked about the 2010 film "All Good Things," a fictionalized version of his life.
"What was the thing that bothered you most about 'All Good Things'?" Lewin asked Durst in the recorded clip played Monday.
"Oh, killing the dogs," Durst responded.
Highlighting that response for jurors, Lewin said Durst "never complained about the fact that the movie depicted him as murdering three people."
"What the evidence will show is that Bob Durst killed Kathie Durst in the midst of a nasty divorce, that he killed Susan Berman because he was afraid that Susan Berman was going to reveal what she knew" and he killed Black to eliminate "a problem," Lewin said shortly before concluding his lengthy presentation.
He called Durst's alleged crimes "cruel, illegal, immoral, homicidal, but not crazy."
Durst's defense team, led by Texas-based lawyer Dick DeGuerin, is expected to present a five-hour opening statement on Tuesday, DeGuerin told The News as he left the courtroom.

Smoke taints Aussie wine lands Vintner: Taste of grapes in wake of bush fires are 'like licking an ashtray'

Texto completo: HUNTER VALLEY, Australia - The hills are lush and green, the grapes plump and ripe. But one bite of this famed valley's most prized product reveals a winemaker's worst nightmare.
"It's like licking an ashtray," said Iain Riggs, a vintner here. "It's really rank and bitter."
The bush fires that raged for eight months in southeastern Australia inflicted widespread damage on the vineyards of the Hunter Valley, not directly from flames, but through the invisible taint of smoke.
Winemakers like Riggs have abandoned hopes for some 2020 vintages. Grapes that were closest to the fires are being left on the vine. Those farther away are being tested for smoke contamination, though it is an inexact science, and in some cases producers won't know whether a wine can be sold until it has fermented in tanks.
Millions of dollars, and the good names of venerable wineries, are on the line.
"You can't put out a bad product," said Chris Tyrell, a fifth-generation winemaker in the valley. "Your reputation, that's all you've got, and we're not willing to risk it."
The Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, is synonymous with wine, which has been produced there for nearly 200 years, beginning in the early decades after the British established a penal colony in New South Wales. Today, the region, which is best known for its sémillon and shiraz varietals, is home to more than 150 wineries.
The valley is a crucial part of an Australian wine industry that has become the fourth-largest exporter of wine by value in the world, after exploding onto the international scene in the 1990s.
It contributes hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the country's economy, not only through domestic and international sales, but also through tourism - another part of the wine business that was hurt by the fires, as vacationers evacuated areas near wine country or abandoned plans to take to the road for tastings.
Before the blazes, the wineries of the Hunter Valley had contended with years of drought. Now, after a record-dry 2019 helped produce bush fires larger than any the country had ever seen, winemakers are suffering a greater blow to production.
Nationwide, the industry is expecting losses in sales of about $110 million.
Many wineries appear unharmed. At the Tyrell winery, rich green orchards surround the simple shed that Tyrell's ancestor Edward Tyrell constructed after arriving from England in the mid-1800s.
But 80% of the grapes cannot be used, and the financial loss amounts to about $5 million, or AU$7 million, Tyrell said. The winery must err on the side of discarding any fruit that might be tainted, he said.
"To have 60 families that work for us and a very old name, we've been here too long and done too much hard work" to take any chances, he added.
Down the road at Brokenwood Wines, where Riggs is the chief winemaker, the smell of crushed grapes and fermented alcohol seeps from empty crates and tanks that are normally bursting with fruit that produces the vineyard's shiraz, chardonnay and sémillon blends.
The winemakers there have become chemists as they try to determine which grapes can be salvaged. Glass beakers cover desks and shelves in the main office, and sheets with lists of numbers and ingredients are entered into computers.
Testing grape sugars for compounds confirming smoke taint is a tricky business.
The grapes themselves "look terrific," he said, and "that's why it's so insidious."

Texto completo: Bill Maher made some controversial comments slamming overreactions to the coronavirus spread. "I'm over this virus," the "Real Time" host said Friday. "The way they talk about it on the news ... they make it sound like if you're within 6 feet of anyone who has it, just get your affairs in order." Maher cited statistics of "the regular flu," saying 517 people have died from it "this season" in California and 61,000 died from it last year. "If that was on TV every day, I'd assume we'd be freaking out," he said. "People die. That's what happens in life. Y2K was going to end the world and the fires in Kuwait were going to end the world and the BP oil spill was going to end the world, and every other ... flu we've ever had. And it didn't."
Mart Crowley, 84, the trailblazing playwright behind "The Boys in the Band," died of complications from a heart attack, according to The New York Times. "The Boys in the Band," a play about a group of gay men who gather for a birthday party in New York, was heralded for revolutionizing how gay men were seen onstage and in popular culture when it debuted off-Broadway in 1968. The play was adapted into a movie in 1970, directed by William Friedkin. It was one of the first major American films to center on gay characters.

Texto completo: Like other commercial fishermen along the east and west coasts, Ethan Wallace had been waiting 18 months for China -- the world's largest importer of live lobster -- to lift crushing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. seafood that had whittled down his profits.
Last week, that moment came: Beijing started allowing Chinese businesses to apply for tariff exemptions. But for Wallace, it no longer mattered.
Tariffs or not, no one in China is buying. The coronavirus outbreak meant the Lunar New Year banquets and wedding parties that feature a fresh lobster on every plate, a symbol of good fortune, were canceled. In several cities, restaurants are shuttered and public indoor gatherings are prohibited.
And even if they weren't, many of the planes that ferry live lobsters aren't flying to China.
"Boom! Coronavirus," said Wallace, 28, after he had steered Piece of the Pie, his 43-foot boat, into the Keys Fisheries marina in Marathon, Florida. Although the season continues through March, he and his crew that day took home more lobster traps than pounds of lobster from the Gulf of Mexico.
"Normally, I would still be out there fishing for the next 15 days or so," he said as two mates unloaded wooden traps laced with seaweed.
Even though the catch trails off near the end of the season, the premium price that buyers are willing to pay for live lobsters that can be shipped to China -- $11 to $12 a pound when the year started -- was worth the effort.
In January, when the Chinese government closed the live-seafood market in Wuhan, the price of lobster in Florida fell overnight by as much as $5 a pound.
Because they will now have to be sold for frozen use, the lobsters aren't worth as much.
"To not catch very much and have no price, it's hard to leave your gear out," said Wallace, who had already beached most of his 3,200 lobster traps. Between fuel and wages for his crew, a day of lobstering can cost him more than $1,000. "Once they dropped the price down, everybody made a beeline for the dock."
"The effect of the coronavirus has been a shake-up across the entire lobster supply chain in the U.S. and Canada," said Annie Tselikis, executive director of the Lobster Dealers' Association in Maine, where four out of five U.S. lobsters are caught.
Now is a slow time for fishing and sales in the state, she said, so the damage has been limited.
Compared with Maine, the annual landings from the Florida Keys are tiny: about 6 million pounds. But half the catch goes to China, the largest single customer.
Over the past decade, China's demand for live lobster -- a sign of wealth and status among the country's rapidly growing middle class -- has transformed Florida's lobster industry. The clawless spiny Caribbean lobsters caught off its coast tend to be more prized in China than Maine's pincered ones.
Known as dragon shrimp, they could be shipped out of Miami and arrive -- alive -- in China 40 hours later.

Texto completo: The hills are lush and green, the grapes plump and ripe. But one bite of this famed valley's most prized product reveals a winemaker's worst nightmare.
"It's like licking an ashtray," said Iain Riggs, a vintner here. "It's really rank and bitter."
The bush fires that raged for eight months in southeastern Australia inflicted widespread damage on the vineyards of the Hunter Valley, not directly from flames, but through the invisible taint of smoke.
Winemakers like Riggs have abandoned hopes for some 2020 vintages. Grapes that were closest to the fires are being left on the vine. Those farther away are being tested for smoke contamination, though it is an inexact science, and in some cases producers won't know whether a wine can be sold until it has fermented in tanks.
Millions of dollars, and the good names of venerable wineries, are on the line.
"You can't put out a bad product," said Chris Tyrell, a fifth-generation winemaker in the valley. "Your reputation, that's all you've got, and we're not willing to risk it."
The Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, is synonymous with wine, which has been produced there for nearly 200 years, beginning in the early decades after the British established a penal colony in New South Wales. Today, the region, which is best known for its semillon and shiraz varietals, is home to more than 150 wineries.
The valley is a crucial part of an Australian wine industry that has become the fourth-largest exporter of wine by value in the world, after exploding onto the international scene in the 1990s.
It contributes hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the country's economy, not only through domestic and international sales, but also through tourism -- another part of the wine business that was hurt by the fires, as vacationers evacuated areas near wine country or abandoned plans to take to the road for tastings.
Before the blazes, the wineries of the Hunter Valley had contended with years of drought. Now, after a record-dry 2019 helped produce bush fires larger than any the country had ever seen, winemakers are suffering a greater blow to production.
Nationwide, the industry is expecting losses in sales of about $110 million.
Many wineries appear unharmed. At the Tyrell winery, rich green orchards surround the simple shed that Tyrell's ancestor Edward Tyrell constructed after arriving from England in the mid-1800s.
But 80% of the grapes cannot be used, and the financial loss amounts to about $5 million, or AU$7 million, Tyrell said. The winery must err on the side of discarding any fruit that might be tainted, he said.
"To have 60 families that work for us and a very old name, we've been here too long and done too much hard work" to take any chances, he added.
Down the road at Brokenwood Wines, where Riggs is the chief winemaker, the smell of crushed grapes and fermented alcohol seeps from empty crates and tanks that are normally bursting with fruit that produces the vineyard's shiraz, chardonnay and semillon blends.
The winemakers there have become chemists as they try to determine which grapes can be salvaged. Glass beakers cover desks and shelves in the main office, and sheets with lists of numbers and ingredients are entered into computers.
Testing grape sugars for compounds confirming smoke taint is a tricky business.
The grapes themselves "look terrific," he said, and "that's why it's so insidious."

Texto completo: Matvey Natanzon, who was known as Falafel because he subsisted on deep-fried chickpea balls hustling gullible opponents in Washington Square Park in Manhattan while he groomed himself to be the world's greatest backgammon player, died Feb. 14 in Clarence, New York, near Buffalo. He was 51.
Natanzon, who was born in Soviet Russia, emigrated to Israel with his mother when he was 4 years old and later moved to the United States, spending his teenage years in Buffalo, was a compulsive gambler.
"If I say it, I have to bet on it," was his credo.
"Recently Falafel made another big bet, the biggest," his friend Jake Jacobs, another backgammon champion, wrote in PrimeTime Backgammon magazine, published by the U.S. Backgammon Federation. "He had cancer. I am not certain of the specifics, but it was serious, deadly serious, attacking the best part of him, his brain. He bet he could beat it."
A shlumpy jovial giant who weighed upward of 300 pounds at one point, Natanzon lost that bet, less than two years after doctors first told him that he had stage-four brain cancer.
His death was announced by his family in a notice in The Buffalo News.
His cancer had prematurely ended a roller-coaster career during which he went from sleeping under a bench in Washington Square Park, where he lived for nearly six months after college, to mastering backgammon, a board game that combines rolls of the dice with strategic checker moves.
"He had the skills to put his money where his mouth was, skills developed through tenacious study," Jacobs said
"Backgammon used to be filled with characters," Jacobs added. "Since the computer era overtook the game in the '90s, there are hardly any characters in the tournament rooms; the only ones to be found are on the keyboards, as players consult robots for answers, instead of consulting wizards such as Falafel. The game needs wizards, and he was one of the last. That's his legacy."
In his short pants, sweatshirt and knitted wool hat, Natanzon could look like an amiable loser to his easy marks, as he baited them with his nonstop babble and swaggering hubris.
He would graduate to winning (and, on rarer occasions, losing) tens of thousands of dollars in as little as an hour; achieve celebrity status in a game that had migrated from black-tie casino tables to cheesy hotel ballrooms, where baseball caps worn backward were de rigeur; and be named the top player in an unofficial ranking by his peers, known as the Giants of Backgammon.
"Falafel is, without a doubt, backgammon's No. 1 commentator and is probably its best-known celebrity," Joe Russell, the chairman of the backgammon federation's board, said when he awarded Natanzon the organization's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. "He has been in the Top 10 of the Giants list seven straight times, and has been voted No. 1 twice and No. 2 once."
Matvey Natanzon was born in what was then Soviet Russia on July 5, 1968. His mother, Larissa Bomshtein, fled with him to Israel when he was 4, he said, to escape anti-Semitism and his father, about whom little is known. They settled in Azor, a town near Tel Aviv, where Bomshtein worked at an airport. When he was 14, she married an Israeli-American Holocaust survivor, Dr. Robert Rein, a biophysicist, and the family moved to Buffalo.
His mother, now Larissa Rein, and his sister, Elaine Lewis, are among his survivors.
Natanzon drank and gambled his way through the State University of New York at Buffalo (now known as the University at Buffalo) and graduated with a degree in accounting in 1991, though emerging jobless and penniless after losing sports wagers. After three years he hitched a ride to Manhattan to make his fortune in Washington Square Park.
"Instead of making money hand over fist on the park's famous chess tables as he dreamed, Natanzon ended up broke and sleeping under them," journalist Brin-Jonathan Butler wrote in "The Grandmaster: Magnus Carlsen and the Match That Made Chess Great Again" (2018).
Natanzon was quoted as saying: "I just didn't like working; sleeping in the park was better than going to work in a cubicle. My relationship with backgammon is the exact opposite of my personality everywhere else in my life. I'm very, very lazy. But when something captures my attention and I want to seek out the truth, I can never let go of it."
He later camped out in a ramshackle game room on Wall Street and at the New York Chess and Backgammon Club in Midtown Manhattan, slept in a flophouse on the Bowery, and rented a room, where, by his account, he would spend 15 hours a day playing online.
Largely self-taught, he played on the Israeli team in the Nations Cup backgammon tournament in 2005, and in 2007 was named by his peers as the world's top player. He lived in Las Vegas and Tel Aviv, among other places.

Texto completo: UConn sports teams will continue to travel as planned, despite restrictions on out-of-state travel for state employees due to the COVID-19 virus.
"UConn was advised that the university could determine essential vs. non-essential travel," an athletic department spokesperson said in a statement. "UConn teams will travel to games as planned. Only essential employees will accompany them."
The UConn men's basketball team is scheduled to play in the American Athletic Conference tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, beginning Thursday. The team's status came into question Monday when Gov. Ned Lamont announced he was freezing all non-essential travel for state employees.
Other Huskies programs, including baseball, softball, women's lacrosse and men's hockey, also have out-of-state events planned for the coming days.
Sporting events across the world have begun to be affected by COVID-19, a new strain of coronavirus. In Italy, all sporting events have been canceled as part of a nationwide lockdown. On Monday, organizers canceled a major professional tennis tournament in Southern California. The New York Times reported Sunday that the NCAA has considered cutting down on sites for its men's and women's basketball tournaments later this month or holding games without spectators.
NCAA chief medical officer Brian Hainline told The Times it was "hard to imagine" the tournaments being canceled altogether.
AAC commissioner Mike Aresco said the league's men's basketball tournament is still set to begin Thursday, despite coronavirus worries.
"Right now, everything is a go in Fort Worth," Aresco said. "We have open lines of communication with the appropriate local and state officials, not only in Forth Worth but at the sites of our other conference championships."
Aresco said the conference has contingency plans in case the situation changes. For now, the AAC has eliminated the requirement that teams shake hands after games and arranged for additional hand-sanitizer stations for players and fans. Despite the conference's edict on hand-shaking, UConn women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma had his players shake hands after Sunday's game with USF, saying, "I ain't worried about it."
In Connecticut, Trinity College has prohibited all university-related travel to states with a declared state of disaster or public health emergency, including for sports teams, and has canceled athletic department trips during spring break. Additionally, the school's website says it "will limit team travel to day trips and eliminate air travel by teams, and it is rescheduling spring break contests within the Northeast."
Southern Connecticut State has canceled a baseball team trip scheduled for next week and plans to review the rest of the season. No Southern teams will travel out of state during spring break.
Lamont's chief operating officer Josh Geballe said Monday that local high schools should consider holding sporting events without spectators to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Still, the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, which governs high school sports in the state, said it will proceed with basketball, hockey and swimming tournaments as scheduled.
"CIAC will be evaluating our tournaments on a daily basis to judge any impact of school closings or increased outbreaks and any changes will be shared in a timely manner," the organization said in a statement.

Texto completo: HUNTER VALLEY, Australia - The hills are lush and green, the grapes plump and ripe. But one bite of this famed valley's most prized product reveals a winemaker's worst nightmare.
"It's like licking an ashtray," said Iain Riggs, a vintner here. "It's really rank and bitter."
The bush fires that raged for eight months in southeastern Australia inflicted widespread damage on the vineyards of the Hunter Valley, not directly from flames, but through the invisible taint of smoke.
Winemakers like Riggs have abandoned hopes for some 2020 vintages. Grapes that were closest to the fires are being left on the vine. Those farther away are being tested for smoke contamination, though it is an inexact science, and in some cases producers won't know whether a wine can be sold until it has fermented in tanks.
Millions of dollars, and the good names of venerable wineries, are on the line.
"You can't put out a bad product," said Chris Tyrell, a fifth-generation winemaker in the valley. "Your reputation, that's all you've got, and we're not willing to risk it."
The Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, is synonymous with wine, which has been produced there for nearly 200 years, beginning in the early decades after the British established a penal colony in New South Wales. Today, the region, which is best known for its sémillon and shiraz varietals, is home to more than 150 wineries.
The valley is a crucial part of an Australian wine industry that has become the fourth-largest exporter of wine by value in the world, after exploding onto the international scene in the 1990s.
It contributes hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the country's economy, not only through domestic and international sales, but also through tourism - another part of the wine business that was hurt by the fires, as vacationers evacuated areas near wine country or abandoned plans to take to the road for tastings.
Before the blazes, the wineries of the Hunter Valley had contended with years of drought. Now, after a record-dry 2019 helped produce bush fires larger than any the country had ever seen, winemakers are suffering a greater blow to production.
Nationwide, the industry is expecting losses in sales of about $110 million.
Many wineries appear unharmed. At the Tyrell winery, rich green orchards surround the simple shed that Tyrell's ancestor Edward Tyrell constructed after arriving from England in the mid-1800s.
But 80% of the grapes cannot be used, and the financial loss amounts to about $5 million, or AU$7 million, Tyrell said. The winery must err on the side of discarding any fruit that might be tainted, he said.
"To have 60 families that work for us and a very old name, we've been here too long and done too much hard work" to take any chances, he added.
Down the road at Brokenwood Wines, where Riggs is the chief winemaker, the smell of crushed grapes and fermented alcohol seeps from empty crates and tanks that are normally bursting with fruit that produces the vineyard's shiraz, chardonnay and sémillon blends.
The winemakers there have become chemists as they try to determine which grapes can be salvaged. Glass beakers cover desks and shelves in the main office, and sheets with lists of numbers and ingredients are entered into computers.
Testing grape sugars for compounds confirming smoke taint is a tricky business.
The grapes themselves "look terrific," he said, and "that's why it's so insidious."

Texto completo: President Trump went to a private fundraiser and roundtable outside Longwood on Monday, his only event of the day in Central Florida after a health conference he planned to attend was canceled because of coronavirus fears.
But he flew back from Sanford with U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who announced later in the day he was "self-isolating" due to his exposure to a coronavirus patient.
The $100,000-per-couple fundraiser for Trump's reelection campaign, held at a private home near the Alaqua Country Club, was listed as being hosted by Diane and Bob Dello Russo.
Air Force One touched down at Orlando Sanford International Airport just after 10:30 a.m., according to the White House pool. Trump greeted and shook hands with well-wishers at the airport.
Most of those lining the motorcade's path on its way to the fundraiser were supporters, with some MAGA hats seen. One exception was a full-size Elmo with a sign saying: "Even I'm turning blue in 2020." Blue is the color of the Democratic Party.
Trump returned to the airport just after 1 p.m., the White House pool said, and Air Force One left Sanford and returned to Washington.
Joining Trump on Air Force One was Gaetz, R-Pensacola, who just a few hours later announced he was "self-isolating" himself because of his exposure to a coronavirus patient at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, last week.
According to the New York Times, Gaetz learned about the exposure after Air Force One lifted off. He then "essentially quarantined himself, sitting in a section of the plane alone."
Earlier, Trump did not respond to shouted questions at the Sanford airport about the stock market, but he did comment on Twitter shortly after he landed. The Dow Jones average dropped more than 2,000 points on Monday and trading had to be halted for 15 minutes.
Shortly after Air Force One touched down in Sanford, Trump tweeted, "Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop," and "Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!"
The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society conference in Orlando, at which Trump was originally scheduled to speak on Monday, was canceled last week because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Trump downplayed the impact of coronavirus in a tweet Monday, including the 22 recorded deaths in the U.S.
"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu," Trump tweeted from Seminole County. "It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"
The Dello Russos are no strangers to Republican fundraising. They had been listed as hosts for a July 2018 Ron DeSantis campaign fundraiser at the Alaqua Country Club headlined by Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. That event also listed indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas as a host. DeSantis later turned over Parnas' and Igor Fruman's $50,000 contribution to the federal government.
Bob Dello Russo is the founder of Del-Air Heating & Air Conditioning & Refrigeration. Other listed hosts included Lee Chira, the owner of LCA Development; Mary Demetree, the owner of Demetree Real Estate Services; Bill Heavener, co-chairman and CEO of Full Sail University; Allan Keen, the owner of the Keewin Real Property Company; Mark Modarres, the CEO of MMM Capital; and Lori Sommers.
Collectively, the hosts have contributed $1.2 million to the Trump campaign or the RNC since Jan. 1, 2019. Dello Russo has raised the most money, a total of $429,000. Heavener, also a member of the University of Florida Board of Trustees, has contributed $312,400.
A $100,000 donation got couples access to the roundtable and a photo and reception with the president. Raising or donating $35,000 gets a photo and access to the reception and $11,200 for the reception alone. Monday's fundraiser was anticipated to raise $4 million with 300 attendees.
Staff writer Ryan Gillespie and the White House pool contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. 'My Dark Vanessa'
by Kate Elizabeth Russell (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Tuesday)
What it's about: When she was 15, Vanessa had a sexual relationship with her 42-year-old English teacher. At the time, she was thrilled by what she thought was a consensual romance. Years later, that same teacher is accused of sexual abuse by a former student. Does Vanessa remain silent and hold on to that illusion, or does she face the ugly truth of her first love?
The buzz: "Russell offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement…" says a review in Publishers Weekly.
2. 'The Mirror & the Light'
by Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt & Co., fiction, on sale Tuesday)
What it's about: The final book in Mantel's historical trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell in the court of King Henry VIII.
The buzz: The publisher has kept a tight lid on this one, but the early reviews are rapturous. "With this trilogy, Mantel has redefined what the historical novel is capable of," says a review in The Guardian.
3. 'MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman'
by Ben Hubbard (Tim Duggan Books, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday)
What it's about: The Beirut bureau chief for the New York Times paints a gripping portrait of the rise of Mohammed bin Salman, the mysterious and powerful young Saudi Arabian prince who ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The buzz: "A chilling look at the ascent of the current young prince of Saudi Arabia to first-in-line to succession," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
4. 'A Good Neighborhood'
by Therese Anne Fowler's (St. Martin's Press, fiction, on sale Tuesday)
What it's about: Two families are at odds in the tight-knit North Carolina community of Oak Knoll. Valerie Alston-Hold, a black professor with a musically gifted, biracial son, objects when her neighbors, the nouveau riche white family, the Whitmans, raze the lot next door to build a showplace. Then their teenagers fall in love.
The buzz: "A riveting, potentially redemptive story of modern American suburbia that reads almost like an ancient Greek tragedy," says a starred review in Kirkus Reviews.
5. 'Recollections of My Nonexistence'
by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, nonfiction, on sale Tuesday)
What it's about: A portrait of the artist as a young woman. In her new memoir, Solnit reflects on her growth as a writer, feminist and activist in 1980s San Francisco, and on finding her voice in a society that prefers women to pipe down.
The buzz: A starred review in Kirkus Reviews calls it "a perceptive, radiant portrait of a writer of indelible consequence."

Texto completo: Strong Memorial Hospital is prepping its laboratory to run tests for the novel coronavirus, though a start of testing is still several weeks ago.
The move to implement testing at Strong and other major New York hospitals is part of the state's efforts to ratchet up testing capacity that at present is woefully inadequate.
The state's Wadsworth Center laboratory began testing nine days ago and can run no more than 200 tests a day for the infectious virus. New York City's public-health lab had run just 120 samples total through Saturday, according to the New York Times.
"That's the dilemma — that there's limited capacity for testing. The testing has to be prioritzed," said Dr. Paul Graman, clinical director of infectious disease and hospital epidemiologist at UR Medicine's Strong Memorial Hospital.
Testing people for coronavirus is considered an important first step in slowing the spread of the respiratory disease. Physicians can place people known to carry the virus in isolation at home or in the hospital, which prevents them from spreading the virus to others in the community and protects health-care workers.
Both the state and New York city labs hope to increase their testing capacity, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pressing for private labs to be allowed to run the test.
But state officials also have turned to academic hospitals like Strong.
Graman said on Friday that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment and other supplies had been ordered and should arrive shortly. But it will take several weeks to set up the equipment and test it.
"These are not just like plugging in your TV and turning it on," he said of the equipment, which extracts molecules from a patient's sample and determines if they are a genetic match with a target specimen. "This is very high technology and it needs to be validated...before we start generating results that people can absolutely trust."
Capacity not yet known It's not known yet how many samples Strong's laboratory will be able to run daily but Graman said same-day results should be available.
As of late last week, only one Rochester-area patient had been tested for coronavirus. That patient, who appeared at Rochester General Hospital Wednesday, was found not to be carrying the coronavirus.
Graman said Friday that Strong physicians had discussed testing patients but decided it was not needed.
It seems inevitable, though, that the demand for local testing will increase — if not sooner, then when the first local coronavirus case is confirmed.
As of Monday morning, 142 people in New York state had been verified by testing to be carrying the virus. More than 4,000 people were quarantined at home because they had been in proximity to one or more of those positive cases.
Most of the positive cases and quarantined individuals were in New York City and Westchester County.
State and local health officials and many physicians have been complaining for weeks at the limited coronavirus testing in the United States.
They have pointed to other countries that quickly developed the capability of testing thousands of people a day; until 10 days ago, the number of samples run in this country was around 500.
Benefits of testing Most state health labs were cleared to begin running their own tests last weekend. New York's Wadsworth lab hopes to ramp up from 200 to 1,000 tests a day in the coming weeks, Graman said, citing a letter from the state health commissioner, Dr. Howard Zucker, that circulated among health officials on Thursday.
Broadly, the value of testing and subsequent verification that a patient has COVID-19 does not accrue to the patient himself. As Graman noted, there is no specific treatment for that illness, so the care the patients receives is the same as for any other viral respiratory infection.
It's everyone else that would benefit from the testing.
"Making a diagnosis is not so critical for the person who might be ill. It's more important for the public-health investigation that might follow the diagnosis," he said. "Once a case is confirmed, there is an immediate effort to identify contacts of that individual, either at home or in the workplace or in travel, et cetera, and to place those contacts of the individual in quarantine at home, so that if they develop symptoms they can be away from other people."

Maya Moore helps overturn an inmate's conviction

Texto completo: WNBA star Maya Moore put her professional basketball career on hold to help pursue the freedom of a Missouri inmate that she believed had been wrongly convicted.
On Monday, Moore helped Jonathan Irons, 39, have his initial conviction overturned, according to ESPN, after he served 22 years of a 50-year sentence, following a conviction of burglary and assault against a homeowner with a gun.
"This day has been a long time coming," Moore said after the hearing, according to ESPN.com. "We are just so grateful and thankful to God and to everybody who has played a role in bringing justice."
Moore had removed herself from consideration for the 2020 U.S. Olympic team in January in order to focus on helping Irons earn his freedom. Moore announced then that she would be skipping her second consecutive professional season, after she had previously led the Minnesota Lynx to four WNBA championships.
Moore had met Irons in 2017, when she toured the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Since then, she helped pay the defense team and has attended several of Irons' courtroom hearings to offer her support.
According to ESPN, the homeowner testified that Irons was the person who assaulted him, but Irons' lawyers argued that there was no evidence to corroborate those allegations. Irons is African-American and was 16 at the time, but was tried as an adult and found guilty by the all-white jury.
Judge Daniel Green granted Irons' petition for a write of habeas corpus, vacating his conviction, according to the report. Judge Green placed a stay on the order, which allows Missouri 15 days to request a review by the appellate court. If the state does not appeal, then St. Charles County has 30 days to decide if it wants to retry Irons.
"It's a very good day," Irons' attorney Kent Gipson said, according to ESPN. "But it's not quite over yet."
Moore had family and friends by her side during the hearing, ESPN reported, and spoke to Irons on the phone after the hearing was over.
"Basketball has not been foremost in my mind," Moore told the New York Times in January in an exclusive interview. "I've been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road. And I've been able to be there for Jonathan."

In a husband, Mandy Moore finds ultimate 'collaborator'

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Smoke taints Aussie wine lands Vintner: Taste of grapes in wake of bush fires are 'like licking an ashtray'

Texto completo: HUNTER VALLEY, Australia - The hills are lush and green, the grapes plump and ripe. But one bite of this famed valley's most prized product reveals a winemaker's worst nightmare.
"It's like licking an ashtray," said Iain Riggs, a vintner here. "It's really rank and bitter."
The bush fires that raged for eight months in southeastern Australia inflicted widespread damage on the vineyards of the Hunter Valley, not directly from flames, but through the invisible taint of smoke.
Winemakers like Riggs have abandoned hopes for some 2020 vintages. Grapes that were closest to the fires are being left on the vine. Those farther away are being tested for smoke contamination, though it is an inexact science, and in some cases producers won't know whether a wine can be sold until it has fermented in tanks.
Millions of dollars, and the good names of venerable wineries, are on the line.
"You can't put out a bad product," said Chris Tyrell, a fifth-generation winemaker in the valley. "Your reputation, that's all you've got, and we're not willing to risk it."
The Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, is synonymous with wine, which has been produced there for nearly 200 years, beginning in the early decades after the British established a penal colony in New South Wales. Today, the region, which is best known for its sémillon and shiraz varietals, is home to more than 150 wineries.
The valley is a crucial part of an Australian wine industry that has become the fourth-largest exporter of wine by value in the world, after exploding onto the international scene in the 1990s.
It contributes hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the country's economy, not only through domestic and international sales, but also through tourism - another part of the wine business that was hurt by the fires, as vacationers evacuated areas near wine country or abandoned plans to take to the road for tastings.
Before the blazes, the wineries of the Hunter Valley had contended with years of drought. Now, after a record-dry 2019 helped produce bush fires larger than any the country had ever seen, winemakers are suffering a greater blow to production.
Nationwide, the industry is expecting losses in sales of about $110 million.
Many wineries appear unharmed. At the Tyrell winery, rich green orchards surround the simple shed that Tyrell's ancestor Edward Tyrell constructed after arriving from England in the mid-1800s.
But 80% of the grapes cannot be used, and the financial loss amounts to about $5 million, or AU$7 million, Tyrell said. The winery must err on the side of discarding any fruit that might be tainted, he said.
"To have 60 families that work for us and a very old name, we've been here too long and done too much hard work" to take any chances, he added.
Down the road at Brokenwood Wines, where Riggs is the chief winemaker, the smell of crushed grapes and fermented alcohol seeps from empty crates and tanks that are normally bursting with fruit that produces the vineyard's shiraz, chardonnay and sémillon blends.
The winemakers there have become chemists as they try to determine which grapes can be salvaged. Glass beakers cover desks and shelves in the main office, and sheets with lists of numbers and ingredients are entered into computers.
Testing grape sugars for compounds confirming smoke taint is a tricky business.
The grapes themselves "look terrific," he said, and "that's why it's so insidious."

Texto completo: Several weeks ago, Sand Hill Road VC firm Andreessen Horowitz received some heckling after posting a "No Handshakes" notice on their front entrance. Coronavirus cases were still rare outside of China, and it was easy to dismiss the precautions as symptomatic of Silicon Valley's heightened self-importance.
Now that multiple U.S. cities have declared a state of emergency, it may be worth considering the decisions of those who spend their days analyzing massive troves of user data - and considering whether that data might be used to draw any conclusions about the virus now known as COVID-19.
Amazon was one of the first companies to withdraw from last month's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona over coronavirus concerns. Amazon ships products to over 100 countries around the world, so it's not surprising that they would be ahead of the curve in predicting disease outbreaks. Just follow the flow of face masks and hand sanitizer. According to Amazon price tracking site camelcamelcamel, the prices of Purell hand sanitizer and disposable masks began to rise around the end of January, a reflection of the impact of supply and demand on automated pricing algorithms.
Then there's Facebook, which tracks the interests, relationships and real-time physical location of 2.4 billion users. (Don't worry, we consented to this when we clicked "Agree" on the terms of service pop-up window.) It's not too much of a stretch to say that the popularity of Facebook Groups may have given the company some insight on the state of global gatherings. Late last month, the company confirmed the cancellation of the annual F8 developers conference, originally scheduled to take place in May in San Jose, Calif.
Google keeps track of user location as well as global traffic flows through its mapping service. On top of that, the search engine fields 3.5 billion queries a day, many of which are health-related search requests from consumers seeking medical advice. Searches for pneumonia, for example, reached an all-time high in January of this year. Google's decision to cancel an internal conference in Vegas and move its upcoming Cloud Next event to a virtual gathering may be better-informed than the guidance issued by our own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It's hard to deny big tech companies the right to apply proprietary data analysis to protect the health of employees and customers, if that's indeed what's happening. It'll be even harder to prevent the government from demanding access to the same information for public health planning. We already saw this happen in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, when the USA Patriot Act authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies to engage in mass surveillance. Widespread panic, whether from terrorism or pandemic, provides a handy excuse to erode civil liberties.
What will happen if the government asks mobile phone carriers to share location data? AT&T and Verizon (who both canceled their participation in last month's RSA conference in San Francisco) were recently fined for failing to safeguard information about customers' real-time locations. Both carriers were previously revealed to have assisted the NSA in warrantless wiretapping.
To see how this might play out, look to Asia. Singapore's Ministry of Health has provided enough information for local citizens to create a website tracking the movement and status of individual cases. Such transparency may be reassuring to the public, but it's also a potential violation of patient privacy.
In China, mobile phone apps such as AliPay and WeChat are used by the government to track people's interactions and perform contact tracing. China has accomplished impressive containment measures, but few Americans aspire to turn the country into China.
Mass surveillance, of course, is not the only solution. Genomic epidemiology, which examines how viruses mutate and accumulate changes during the course of transmission, may be a decent predictor of disease spread. Better distribution of test kits will certainly fill information gaps and help the public manage disease risk.
So far the CDC has been remarkably inadequate on COVID-19 testing, forcing employers into a collective action problem - no one wants to be the first to scale back business interests. Several of the biggest U.S. banks have restricted nonessential international travel. In San Francisco, Square, Twitter, Stripe and Coinbase have all urged employees to work from home. Maybe it's time for the rest of us to consider following their lead.

Texto completo: FORT MYERS, Fla. — The NHL, NBA, Major League Baseball, and the MLS are restricting media access to dressing rooms in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The four professional leagues issued a joint statement Monday night saying media access will be conducted in designated locations outside the locker rooms. The temporary changes take effective Tuesday.
The Red Sox on Sunday had a meeting to discuss precautions. I think professional teams would always prefer to replace clubhouse access with formal, sterilized, boring availability. We all want to prevent the spread of this virus. Cramming 20-30 reporters around Chris Sale's locker might not be the best idea at this time.
The Colorado Avalanche posted a sign outside their locker room reminding media members: "No hand shakes. No knuckles. No hugs. No sitting at stalls.''
In this spirit, I resisted the urge to hug Alex Verdugo when I first approached him in the Red Sox clubhouse Monday morning. Similarly, J.D. Martinez and I eschewed our traditional fist bump.
But let's not create a clear path to eliminate locker room access in perpetuity. Sadly, potential media-restriction policies were greeted with applause over the weekend by a couple of well-heeled sportswriters who insulted a century of hard work by beat reporters while simultaneously promoting erosion of media availability in professional sports locker rooms.
“I honestly don't think we ever need to be in a locker room," tweeted the estimable Grant Wahl, a 25-year veteran of Sports Illustrated who covers the US women's soccer team. “Doing mixed-zone postgame interviews with the USWNT outside their locker room has never been a problem."
Sopan Deb, who identifies as “NBA culture scribe" and has been with the New York Times for at least a half-hour, quickly chimed in with, "THIS IS 100 PERCENT CORRECT. It is so weird that for decades it became accepted practice for reporters to just hang out in locker room watching/waiting for athletes to get dressed.''
Both writers quickly backtracked. Wahl confessed that his tweet was “dumb," while Deb deleted his message. But that won't stop a legion of team-loving, media-hating fanboys from rushing to their keyboards to vilify journalists who fuel the 24/7 programming for our sports talk industrial complex.
Let me stop here to once again scratch my head at the number of fans who hunger for information about their favorite players/teams while routinely harpooning and mocking those who actually provide such content, a.k.a. the beat reporters. It is the beat reporters who spend thousands of hours cultivating sources, panning for nuggets in big league locker rooms across America. It is not fun. It is exhausting, often demeaning, and frequently fruitless. But without that work, there would be little fuel for fans and professional bloviators.
And that work, my friends, cannot be done in overcrowded, sanitized “mixed zones," or Pentagonesque briefing sessions designed to promote the message of the teams without uncomfortable disclosures. Simply stated, your sports reporters need access to “the room" to develop trust, to talk to players one-on-one, to find out what is really going on. This is rarely done in the “mixed zone."
I never liked working the room, and do less of it than ever, but I did it daily for many years. It was never fun, but it is a critical part our job as “eyes and ears" of the fans.
In the late 1970s, I smoked out Orioles manager Earl Weaver after a game to ask him about pinch hitter Terry Crowley. Weaver had used Crowley as a starter that day and Crowley had three hits. I asked Earl if perhaps Crowley should be playing more regularly, and the Hall of Fame manager said, “No. He's only here because I know how to use him. If it weren't for me, Crowley would be working in a brewery."
Trust me when I tell you that Weaver would not have said that at a postgame podium.
In 1984, when the Celtics were prepping to face the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, I asked Cedric Maxwell about the prospect of guarding New York forward Bernard King, who had routinely scored 40 points in first-round games against the Pistons. Max stood up, mimicked King's runway-model walking style, and said, “No way the [expletive] is getting 40 off me!"
Not something I'd have gleaned from the “mixed zone." (King scored 43 in Game 4 and 44 in Game 6, but the Celtics won the series in seven.)
In a one-on-one interview in the Red Sox spring clubhouse in Winter Haven in the late 1980s, Wade Boggs displayed tire tracks on his forearm (from his wife accidentally running him over in the family Jeep the night before) and exclaimed, “I'm the white Irving Fryar!"
Oil Can Boyd told me he got drunk the night before the seventh game of the 1986 World Series because “I had no reason not to," after John McNamara scratched him from the start. It was in the Sox clubhouse at Fenway Park that Roger Clemens told me he had a manager who was too drunk to take him out of a game in which he was being routed.
It was in the Sox locker room that Josh Beckett spit on the ground at the mention of Red Sox owners trashing the deposed Terry Francona and said, “I hope Tito buries those [expletives]."
Just three years ago, I took a West Coast trip with the Red Sox and got David Price to say that he thought Dennis Eckersley was too rough when commenting on the Red Sox (“Ask anyone in this room!" said Price). On that same day in the clubhouse in Anaheim, another Sox player confirmed that teammates applauded Price when he ambushed Eckersley on a Red Sox charter from Boston to Toronto.
Those are extreme examples. Most of what is culled by reporters “hanging out in the locker room, watching/waiting for players to get dressed" is the simple day-to-day information regarding the health and prospects of athletes hired to win games and entertain fans. It is tedious, time-sucking work. It's also totally necessary if fans desire to be informed about the teams they love.
These are scary times. It's vital to protect mankind and limit the spread of this virus. Sox players have been told to stop high-fiving and spitting on the dugout floor.
A temporary change in clubhouse access rules might be necessary to stop the spread of coronavirus. But here's hoping this doesn't become a permanent thing.
Fans hungry for information about their teams would do well to understand what is lost when you take sports reporters out of the locker room.

Trump tweets a meme of himself fiddling

Texto completo: President Trump looked serene as he rested the left side of his face against the violin. The meme showed him with his eyes closed and seemingly relaxed playing the instrument amid mounting concerns of the global spread of the novel coronavirus.
"My next piece is called," the meme said in bold white letters, "nothing can stop what's coming."
When Trump tweeted the image on Sunday night, he said that while he appreciated the sentiment of the meme he was sharing from White House social media director Dan Scavino, he did not exactly understand the meaning behind it.
"Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!" Trump tweeted.
The symbolism of the image and language, however, was enough for many to form their own conclusions surrounding recent events. Trump sharing the image was looked at by critics as an allusion to the legend of Roman emperor Nero who fiddled as Rome burned around him. Others pointed out that the line "Nothing can stop what's coming" is a popular phrase linked to the far-right online conspiracy theory QAnon, whose followers have made their fringe presence known at the president's rallies and have had their content promoted by Trump.
The meme came as the number of coronavirus cases in the United States topped 500 over the weekend, before the Dow sustained heavy losses Monday thanks to a new oil war sparked by the outbreak. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
The image reminiscent of Nero trended on Twitter into early Monday, and only intensified when people learned that the president played golf at his club Sunday in West Palm Beach, Fla., with players from the Washington Nationals.
"It means Rome is burning and you're fiddling around a golf course, Nero," replied Walter Shaub, a Trump critic and former director of the Office of Government Ethics.

Manipulated Biden video escalates online speech war
A manipulated video featuring Joe Biden and spread by President Trump over the weekend has ratcheted up an online war that has put Twitter and Facebook in the middle of a debate over political speech.
The campaigns have fought for months over misinformation targeting Biden, and the latest salvo has taken on greater import with his surge in the Democratic primaries.
In response to such misinformation, the tech platforms have written new and diverging rules on political speech. On Sunday, Twitter tagged the video in question as manipulated content, while Facebook left the video intact without any flags about the false content.
The video came from a stump speech by Biden on Saturday in Kansas City, Mo., where he appeared to struggle through a sentence and with halting words said, “We can only reelect Donald Trump."
But the rest of Biden's sentence was selectively edited out. In full, Biden was stressing the need for Democrats to unite against Trump.
The president's reelection campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.
After users flagged the video to Twitter on Sunday, the company said it had determined the video violated its rules against synthetic and manipulated video and labeled the video as manipulated content. By that point, it had been viewed more than 5 million times and retweeted more than 20,000 times.
It was the first time Twitter had applied a policy announced in February against fake and misleading videos. Facebook, however, did not remove or flag the video as misinformation, angering the Biden campaign. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
New York Times
Ex- presidential candidate Cory Booker endorses Biden
Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, endorsed Joe Biden for president Monday, adding to what has become a nearly complete consolidation of support from Biden's former top rivals to push him to the Democratic nomination.
Booker's endorsement comes one day after Senator Kamala Harris of California endorsed Biden, and the two senators will appear with him at a rally in Detroit on Monday night.
Booker will also campaign alongside Biden in Flint, Mich., earlier in the day and attend a fund-raiser with him.
The event in Michigan, which holds its delegate-heavy primary Tuesday, will be yet another public show of moderate Democratic support for the former vice president on the eve of a major vote in the presidential race.
Biden also picked up two major endorsements, as two national gun control advocacy groups — Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign — announced their support.

Texto completo: Catch the latest season of the German noir thriller, and a doc about Cheryl Miller and the U.S.C. women's basketball team.
What's Streaming
BABYLON BERLIN Stream on Netflix. This German crime noir covered a lot of ground in its first two seasons. It followed the detective Gereon Rath and the aspiring police officer Charlotte Ritter as they came up against rising nationalist sentiments, a stolen train filled with Soviet gold and a disastrous May Day confrontation between the police and Communists, all set in the years that preceded the Third Reich. In its third season, the show returns to explore aspects of Berlin's gritty underworld and growing film industry as Rath and Ritter work to track down a cloaked killer who's been terrorizing a movie shoot. Along the way, Ritter works to gain respect with the homicide squad, Rath encounters troubles at home, and the country braces for financial collapse.
MARC MARON: END TIMES FUN Stream on Netflix. At the moment, the world is feeling pretty apocalyptic, between coronavirus fears, economic concerns and the threat of natural disasters. But as anxieties continue to mount, it feels like a prime moment for Marc Maron's latest comedy special, "End Times Fun." In it, the comedian chastises the way most people collectively shrug their shoulders when it comes to climate change: "We brought our own bags to the supermarket," Maron says in his set, pausing, "and that's about it!" Maron devotes the rest of his time to commenting on Marvel movie fans, life before cellphones and the importance of consuming turmeric.
LITTLE JOE (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, YouTube and Vudu. This film, which earned its star Emily Beecham the best actress award at Cannes last year, tracks the events that occur following the development of a plant that's engineered to improve people's moods. Little Joe, as the breed of plant is named, releases a potent antidepressant that not only makes those who inhale it happy, but also seems to strangely alter their behavior. The film has been described as "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" for the antidepressant age, but in his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny takes that idea a step further. The film looks like "a 'Snatchers' reboot as directed by a pod person," he wrote. "The deliberateness of the styling makes the story's predictability feel more like inexorability," he added. "The events may be familiar, but their stagings are unusual and often uncanny."
What's on TV
WOMEN OF TROY 9 p.m. on HBO. This documentary focuses not on the mythical Battle of Troy, but on a team of skilled competitors who rose to victory on the basketball court. In the 1980s, the University of Southern California women's basketball team, led by Cheryl Miller, won two national titles and rose to mainstream prominence. The film explores how Miller, along with her teammates Pam McGee, Paula McGee, Cynthia Cooper, Juliette Robinson and Rhonda Windham, helped pave the way for female basketball players to compete at a professional level with the eventual founding of the W.N.B.A. in 1996.

When I first met Nancy Wexler, more than 30 years ago, the walls outside her office were papered with a seemingly endless family tree that traced the path of a hereditary brain disorder, Huntington's disease, through thousands of people -- 10 generations -- in a family in Venezuela with the world's highest rates of the disease.
Dr. Wexler welcomed me like I was an old friend, and she and her colleagues gave me hours of their time to explain their work, for an article I was writing for Discover magazine. She is one of those rare people who make you feel like you're the smartest, most interesting person in the room.
The gene for Huntington's had not yet been found, but colleagues on her project in Venezuela had identified a stretch of DNA near it, a marker, which made it possible for some people to find out whether they had inherited the deadly gene. Every child of a parent with Huntington's has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene, and the disease.
Huntington's usually comes on when people are in the prime of life, in their 30s or 40s. Gradual brain degeneration causes uncontrollable movements and can bring mental and psychological problems. The disease is fatal, but people suffer for years. There's no treatment.
Dr. Wexler was at the center of the story I was pursuing. She was in the midst of her groundbreaking work in Venezuela, making yearly trips to remote villages. But the project was also personal for her: Her mother, uncles and grandfather had all died of Huntington's.
I asked her if she had been tested. She would not say.
I interviewed her father, Dr. Milton Wexler, a psychotherapist, who started the Hereditary Disease Foundation to raise money for research to find a cause and cure for Huntington's. He told me he thought that both his daughters, Nancy and her older sister, Alice, would be spared.
Dr. Wexler continued to study Huntington's, learning more about the nature of the defect and the role other genes might play in modifying its effects. Her work helped pave the way for experimental treatments that have started to show promise.
Many years went by before I saw her again. Since 1998, I've been a reporter at The New York Times, writing mostly about medicine and science.
A few years ago, I saw a video of Dr. Wexler online. My heart sank. Her head and limbs were moving around a lot. Too much, I thought. I'm not a doctor, but I couldn't help wondering if, after all, she had not been spared. The internet was full of information about her -- she has won many awards -- but there was not a word about her own health.
It seemed like a powerful human story, one I wanted to tell. But how to approach it? I didn't want to just call her and ask. It seemed rude, cruel and possibly unethical: If she did have the disease, might it be affecting her mentally, and would I then be taking advantage of someone who might not be fully able to consent to an interview?
I looked up her sister, Alice Wexler, a historian and author. I got the impression she was well. I contacted her, and we talked on the phone. Alice thought I had some nerve, and I couldn't blame her. Why didn't I call Nancy myself? she asked. I tried to explain my hesitation, but Alice wasn't buying it. The call ended, and I felt like an oaf.
It still felt wrong to call Dr. Wexler. But she was the heart and soul and driving force behind research into Huntington's. The discovery of the gene, in 1993, might never have happened without her. I mentioned my interest to someone I knew in the media office at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, where Dr. Wexler is a professor. He inquired. It wasn't time. I let it go.
A few weeks ago, I got word. The time had come. Dr. Wexler wanted to talk with me, at her apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She greeted me with the warmth I remembered, and a hug. She looked frail, and unsteady on her feet.
I had asked for an hour for our first visit. We talked for almost five hours.
She was not eager to talk about herself. She was more interested in describing her research and the Venezuelans, and giving them credit and thanks for taking part in the effort to find the gene. She worried about them and whether they would ever receive treatment if drugs were developed based on the information they had provided.
We did come around to her own health. Dr. Wexler had thought for years that she had Huntington's, but had the diagnosis confirmed only recently, through a physical exam by a neurologist. She never did take the genetic test that resulted from her own research. She spoke about her fear, sadness and anger, but also hope and optimism that drugs now being studied would turn out to slow the disease, or even stop it -- maybe even in time for her.
It was a story worth waiting for, and I hope I've done it justice.

Texto completo: Readers urge Joe Biden to "defuse this shameful Republican tactic" and they argue that President Trump's children should not get a "free pass." Also: Voting as a duty; the 1954 attack on Congress.
To the Editor:
Re "G.O.P. Scrutinizes Son as Father Rises in Polls" (news article, March 6):
The Republicans are gearing up to make the issue of Hunter and Joe Biden's alleged corruption in Ukraine the equivalent of Hillary Clinton's emails. The media engaged in the email issue for far too long, and it dogged her throughout the election. Joe Biden needs to get out in front of this Republican tactic now and put it to bed before it distracts from, if not consumes, his campaign.
The Republican Senate is undertaking an investigation into the Bidens. We should expect the "results" of these efforts to be strategically dropped into the election cycle at pivotal moments. Joe Biden needs to defuse this shameful Republican tactic by telling the American public to expect this, to see it for what it is and to otherwise ignore it. And he needs to do it now. Then he, too, should ignore it and move on to the important messages of his campaign.

To the Editor:
Re "Kushner to Exit Start-Up That Pursued Tax Break" (news article, March 6):
Now that Joe Biden is his probable opponent, President Trump and his campaign have ramped up their threat to investigate Hunter Biden. Inexplicably, Mr. Trump has pretty much gotten a free pass on the activities of his own family. It's time for that to end.
The Democrats need to pound hard and relentlessly on such things as Jared Kushner's participation in and windfall from a start-up that capitalized on a provision in the 2017 tax law. Also worthy of investigation is the last-minute financial lifeline extended to his family real estate firm from Qatar. Very fishy.
Then there's Ivanka. How and why did she get those valuable trademarks from China? Also, can you imagine the uproar if Bill Clinton or Barack Obama had put their child into a White House job of inestimable access and personal power?
Finally, will anyone track the activities of Don Jr. and Eric Trump as they roam the world on our dime?

To the Editor:
Re "Observation, Not Participation" (Inside The Times, March 8):
Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, and other Times journalists speak eloquently about the need for political impartiality, objectivity and trust in their professional lives. But to not vote, like Mr. Baker, may be the height of irresponsibility.
Even journalists live with the consequences of our political choices. Every vote counts!

Casualties in 1954 Attack on Congress
To the Editor:
I read with interest your March 4 obituary of Rafael Cancel Miranda, the last of the assailants who shot up the U.S. Capitol's House chamber in 1954 in the name of Puerto Rican independence ("Rafael Cancel Miranda, Gunman in 1954 Attack on Congress, Dies at 89").
I found it curious, however, that while the obituary named Mr. Cancel Miranda's accomplices and mentioned the fact that five members of Congress were struck by the shooters' bullets, those congressmen weren't named.
They were Alvin Bentley (Republican of Michigan); Ben F. Jensen (Republican of Iowa); George Hyde Fallon (Democrat of Maryland); Kenneth A. Roberts (Democrat of Alabama), and one of my predecessors in representing Memphis, Clifford Davis (Democrat of Tennessee).
In chronicling Mr. Cancel Miranda's role in this historic event, not mentioning his victims seems a significant omission.

Texto completo: Widely hailed as one of the finest actors of his generation, Mr. von Sydow formed a close relationship with the director Ingmar Bergman and became an elder pop culture star.
Max von Sydow, the tall, blond Swedish actor who cut a striking figure in American movies but was most identified with the signature work of a fellow Swede, the director Ingmar Bergman, died on Sunday. He was 90.
His wife, Catherine von Sydow, confirmed the death in an emailed statement. No cause was given. The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet said he died in Provence, France.
Widely hailed as one of the finest actors of his generation, Mr. von Sydow became an elder pop culture star in his later years, appearing in a "Star Wars" movie in 2015 as well as in the sixth season of the HBO fantasy-adventure series "Game of Thrones."He even lent his deep, rich voice to "The Simpsons."
By then he had become a familiarly austere presence in popular movies like William Friedkin's "The Exorcist," Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report," Woody Allen's "Hannah and Her Sisters" and, more recently, Julian Schnabel's "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."
But to film lovers the world over he was most enduringly associated with Bergman.
If ever an actor was born to inhabit the World According to Bergman, it was Mr. von Sydow. Angular and lanky at 6-foot-3, possessing a gaunt face and hooded, icy blue eyes, he not only radiated power but also registered a deep sense of Nordic angst, helping to give flesh to Bergman's often bleak but hopeful and sometimes comic vision of the human condition in classics like "The Seventh Seal" and "The Virgin Spring."
In "The Seventh Seal" (1958), Mr. von Sydow played Antonius Block, a strapping medieval knight who returns from the Crusades to his plague-ravaged homeland only to encounter the stern, ghostly pale, black-hooded figure of Death, played by Bengt Ekerot. To stave off the inevitable, Block challenges Death to a game of chess, and in the long intervals between moves he searches the countryside for some shred of human goodness.
The two grim figures hunched over a chessboard in a desolate north-country landscape made for an unforgettable cinematic image, which has been both imitated and parodied. But sustained Hollywood stardom eluded Mr. von Sydow, despite his promising introduction to a wide audience in the lead role of George Stevens's biblical epic "The Greatest Story Ever Told," released in 1965.
Though that movie turned out to be less than a blockbuster, Mr. von Sydow's performance as Jesus was good enough to bring a flood of offers his way. Still, he often found himself typecast as a stereotypical bad guy, thanks to his imposing physique, strong features and Scandinavian accent.
"I wish I could have a wider choice of roles in American productions," he told The New York Times in 1983, "the kind of roles I get in Europe." Unfortunately, he said, American film producers "only offer you exact copies of roles you successfully performed before."
In 'Exorcist,' the Title Role
There were exceptions. In one of his most commercially successful films, "The Exorcist" (1973), an adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best seller, Mr. von Sydow played a grimly resolute Jesuit priest summoned in the film's last scenes to rescue a girl possessed by a demon.
But it was not until his later years that he could range widely in American movies. In "Hannah and Her Sisters" (1986) he was the possessive lover of the youngest sister, played by Barbara Hershey. In the science-fiction thriller "Minority Report" (2002) he was Tom Cruise's coolly efficient boss, the director of a police force that benefits from telepathic powers to stop crimes before they are committed.
Mr. von Sydow earned his first Academy Award nomination in 1988 -- some 40 years after his movie debut -- for his work in "Pelle the Conqueror." A Danish film directed by Bille August, it told the story of Lasse (Mr. von Sydow), a down-at-heels widowed Swedish laborer who brings his young son, Pelle, to Denmark at the turn of the century in search of a better life, only to encounter still more hard times.
There were other late-career high points, including "Hamsun" (1997), in which Mr. von Sydow submerged himself in the tangled personality of the Nobel Prize-winning Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun, whose age and ego led him to become a tool of the Nazis during World War II.
By his late 80s, cast in the brief role of the village elder Lor San Tekka in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" and as the enigmatic seer Three Eyed Raven in Season Six of "Game of Thrones," he was having, as the critic Terrence Rafferty wrote in The Atlantic in 2015, "the sort of late career that eminent movie actors tend to have, popping up for a scene or two in commercial stuff that needs a touch of gravity, and receiving, as famous old actors do, the honor of 'last billing."'
He was also treated to a fresh round of recognition. "For a significant portion of his six decades onscreen," Mr. Rafferty wrote, "he has been the greatest actor alive."
Mr. von Sydow received his second Oscar nomination, as supporting actor, in 2011 for his performance in the otherwise critically savaged "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close," in which he played the mute companion of a boy whose father had died in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. (In a wry handwritten note to the Academy expressing his gratitude, he wrote, "I don't know what to say.")
Perhaps no role was as emotionally charged for him as the one he played in the French-language film "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" (2007): a frail, elderly man whose emotional defenses collapse when he learns that his son's paralytic stroke is irreversible. The role reminded him of his relationship with his own father and of all the unresolved issues between them, he told The New York Times Magazine in 2008.
"I had great difficulty getting rid of my emotion after making this movie," he said.
Parents Were Educators
Carl Adolf von Sydow was born on April 10, 1929, in Lund, in southern Sweden. His father was a university professor, his mother a schoolteacher. He attended the Cathedral School in Lund, where he learned English at an early age, and began his acting career in an amateur theater group he founded with friends.
He was said to have adopted the name Max from the star performer in a flea circus he saw while serving in the Swedish Quartermaster Corps.
After his military service, he studied at the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm, from 1948 to 1951, and made his screen debut in "Only a Mother" (1949), Alf Sjoberg's drama about a woman raising a brood of children while toiling in virtual serfdom in a class-riven Sweden.
In 1951, while still in Stockholm, Mr. von Sydow married Kerstin Olin, an actress, with whom he had two sons, Clas and Henrik. The marriage ended in divorce after 45 years.
Along with his sons and Catherine von Sydow, he is survived by her sons, Cedric and Yvan, whom he adopted, according to the Expressen newspaper.
Mr. von Sydow began his long association with Bergman in 1955, when Mr. von Sydow moved to the city of Malmo, in southern Sweden, and joined the Malmo Municipal Theater, with which Bergman was associated.
Over the next few years Mr. von Sydow appeared in many Bergman films, becoming an important member of what was essentially the director's repertory company, whether in lesser roles (in "Wild Strawberries" and "Brink of Life") or lead ones (in "The Magician," "Through a Glass Darkly" and "The Virgin Spring").
In "The Virgin Spring" (1960), he played a wealthy man whose daughter is raped and murdered by two local shepherds. When he discovers the identity of the killers, he methodically plans and executes a bloody revenge.
Some 20 years later, reflecting on how Bergman had shaped his performance as the vengeful father, Mr. von Sydow said: "The rage slowly builds up in him until he finally explodes and kills -- it's a buildup which is long and slow and meticulous. Bergman uses a lot of time and thought to build up an emotion. He milks it. You think the explosion will come, but no, and the tension exhausts you."
By the early 1960s Mr. von Sydow was getting offers from Hollywood and turning them down, saying he was happy enough with his work in Sweden. Then he was offered the role of Jesus in "The Greatest Story Ever Told," and he went to Hollywood, embarking on an international career.
In 1966, in "Hawaii," based on the novel by James A. Michener and directed by George Roy Hill, Mr. von Sydow gave a nuanced performance as a young minister who comes to 19th-century Hawaii with his wife (Julie Andrews) to seek converts among the native islanders.
More typically, though, and to his mounting frustration, he played the villain -- a neo-Nazi in "The Quiller Memorandum" (1966), a power-hungry Russian in "The Kremlin Letter" (1970), a fedora-wearing hired assassin in "Three Days of the Condor" (1975), the otherworldly emperor Ming the Merciless in the cartoonish "Flash Gordon" (1980), the archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond film "Never Say Never Again" (1983).
More challenging roles awaited him back in Sweden, and in the late 1960s he returned there to make another series of films with Bergman and another master Swedish director, Jan Troell. He appeared in Bergman's "Hour of the Wolf" (1968), "Shame" (1968), "The Passion of Anna" (1969) and "The Touch" (1971) and went on to star with Liv Ullmann in "The Emigrants" (1971) and "The New Land" (1972), Mr. Troell's two-part saga about 19th-century Swedish settlers in the United States.
Mr. von Sydow made his Broadway debut in 1977 as the star of "The Night of the Tribades," a play by Per Olov Enquist about the Swedish writer August Strindberg. Despite a cast that also included Eileen Atkins and Bibi Andersson (another Bergman mainstay, who died last April), the production ran for less than two weeks.
Broadway theatergoers had another brief encounter with Mr. von Sydow in 1981, when he starred with Anne Bancroft in "Duet for One," Tom Kempinski's drama about the cellist Jacqueline du Pre, whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis. Mr. von Sydow played the kindly therapist who tries to help her through her depression.
That play, too, had only a short run, but there were better things to come for Mr. von Sydow, almost all of them on film.
In another role with psychological depth, in "The Flight of the Eagle" (1983), directed by Mr. Troell, he was the leader of an ill-fated party of explorers who try to fly over the North Pole in a hydrogen balloon. Writing in The Times, Vincent Canby described the movie, an Academy Award nominee for best foreign-language film, as "so good that it makes one want to know more."
Sweden Grew Distant
For all his connection to the land of his birth and of Bergman, Sweden became distant to Mr. von Sydow. In the 1980s, though he had a summer house on an island in the Baltic Sea, he lived in Rome. His sons attended American universities.
"I have nowhere really to call home," he told The Times. "I feel I have lost my Swedish roots. It's funny because I've been working in so many places that now I feel at home in many locations. But Sweden is the only place I feel less and less at home."
Mr. von Sydow remained among a select group of actors to have formed symbiotic relationships with directors, in which one helps the other achieve a high level of artistry. He found kindred spirits in two filmmakers. One was Mr. Troell, who directed him in seven films and wanted him to take the lead in "The Last Sentence," his acclaimed 2012 film. He declined, Mr. Troell said, because at 85 Mr. von Sydow felt "he was too old." (The role went to Jesper Christensen, 19 years his junior.)
The other, of course, was Bergman. Mr. von Sydow recalled his last conversation with the director, who died in Sweden in 2007 at 89: "He said, 'Max, you have been the first and the best Stradivarius that I have ever had in my hands."'

Texto completo: For the first time, Twitter applied its policy against fake and misleading videos and labeled one.
WASHINGTON -- A manipulated video featuring Joseph R. Biden Jr. and spread by President Trump over the weekend has ratcheted up an online war that has put Twitter and Facebook in the middle of a debate over political speech.
The campaigns have fought for months over misinformation targeting Mr. Biden, and the latest salvo has taken on greater import with his surge in the Democratic primaries.
In response to such misinformation, the tech platforms have written new and diverging rules on political speech. On Sunday, Twitter tagged the video in question as manipulated content, while Facebook left the video intact without any flags about the false content.
The video came from a stump speech by Mr. Biden on Saturday in Kansas City, Mo., where he appeared to struggle through a sentence and with halting words said, "We can only re-elect Donald Trump."
But the rest of Mr. Biden's sentence was selectively edited out. In full, Mr. Biden was stressing the need for Democrats to unite against Mr. Trump.
"We can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It's got to be a positive campaign," he said.
Through Saturday, manipulated video of Mr. Biden's words caught fire.
Dan Scavino, Mr. Trump's assistant and the White House director of social media, shared a version of the video on Saturday on Twitter and Facebook.
"Sleepy Joe in St. Louis, Missouri today: 'We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump. #KAG2020LandslideVictory," Mr. Scavino wrote with a link to the video.
Mr. Trump then retweeted Mr. Scavino's post late Saturday.
"The video was not manipulated," Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump re-election campaign, said. "Joe Biden really is that bad."
The video circulated throughout much of Sunday without a response from the social media networks. After users flagged the video to Twitter on Sunday, the company said it had determined that the video violated its rules against synthetic and manipulated video and labeled the video as manipulated content. By that point, it had been viewed more than five million times and retweeted more than 20,000 times.
It was the first time that Twitter applied a policy announced in February against fake and misleading videos. Facebook, however, did not remove or flag the video as misinformation, angering the Biden campaign.
"Facebook's malfeasance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false information is a national crisis in this respect," Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's campaign manager, said in a statement.
"It is also an unconscionable act of putting profit above not just our country, but every country," he added. "Facebook won't say it, but it is apparent to all who have examined their conduct and policies: They care first and foremost about money and, to that end, are willing to serve as one of the world's most effective mediums for the spread of vile lies."
Mr. Biden's campaign has complained about false online ads by Mr. Trump's re-election campaign before, beginning in October with an ad on Facebook and other social media outlets that asserted that Mr. Biden had bribed the Ukrainian government to stop an investigation into his son.
Facebook refused to remove that video, saying false speech by politicians and their campaigns was permitted as an important facet to political discourse. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, reinforced that view with a speech on free expression at Georgetown University in October, in which he said that political speech was one of the most vetted forms of discourse and that it was important for the public to hear from politicians, including lies.
In a statement on Monday, Facebook said, "Fact checkers rated this video as partly false, so we are reducing its distribution and showing warning labels with more context for people who see it, try to share it or already have."

Texto completo: Can I take my kid to the playground or on the subway? Should my child be tested? We asked experts.
Schools across the country are closing and sporting events are getting canceled because of the new coronavirus, and parents have many unanswered questions. In particular, should they continue taking their children to densely populated areas like playgrounds, movie theaters and museums, which may contain many other kids whose personal boundaries and hygiene levels are not always ideal?
Because the situation is evolving rapidly and the virus is new, the advice may change as we learn more. "We're not seeing much in the way of serious illness among children," said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. "And as a result, we're not really testing children nearly as much, so we don't even know the role of children in the transmission of this disease."
With that in mind, here are some answers to common questions.
Can I still take my child to public places?
It depends. If you live in a community where the virus is actively spreading -- like in Seattle -- you may want to practice social distancing, said Dr. Hotez, which means sticking close to home and avoiding large groups of people. But if you live in a place where there is not reported community transmission, you can still take your child to the playground, the movies, to museums and sporting events.
"We're not recommending a lot of changes" for now, said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U. Langone's Hassenfeld Children's Hospital, and a parent.
Of course, the situation is changing by the hour, so your best bet is to regularly check your state and local public health department websites for recommendations, said Dr. Sean O'Leary, M.D., an executive member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases.
As always, encourage hand washing when children come in from outside and before and after meals. Kids should sing "Happy Birthday" twice to know how long to wash their hands, and then make sure they are drying them thoroughly. There's some evidence that paper towels are more hygienic than hand dryers in public bathrooms. Hand washing is also more effective than hand sanitizer, though hand sanitizer can be used when hand washing is not an option.
The store is out of hand sanitizer. Should I make my own?
Recipes for homemade hand sanitizer are circulating online, but none of the experts I spoke to recommended making your own, even if stores have run out. Many popular brands of hand sanitizer, like Purell or Highmark, have an established concentration of alcohol, generally between 60 and 95 percent, Dr. Madan said, which helps ensure their effectiveness. Additionally, she said, "we have experience using it in hospitals, and we know how effective it is." The same evidence base for homemade recipes doesn't yet exist.
If you are using store-bought hand sanitizer, make sure that it's at least 60 percent alcohol and that it fully dries before you or your child touch anything -- otherwise it won't work as well. Also keep in mind that hand sanitizers are not as effective when used on "visibly dirty or greasy" hands, according to the C.D.C.
My child has mild cold or flu symptoms. Should I take him to the hospital?
No. Coronavirus symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but if your child has a mild fever, runny nose or sore throat, you should call your pediatrician first before going anywhere. From what we know so far, runny noses -- which are a near-constant among preschoolers -- are rarely a symptom of infection with the new coronavirus, but sore throats sometimes are. "We want people who are not critically ill to stay out of the hospital," Dr. Madan said. Keep your child out of school if he or she is sick.
However, if your child develops more severe symptoms such as trouble breathing, an inability to eat or drink or a change in behavior, you should visit a doctor, Dr. Madan said.
If my child is very sick, will she be able to get tested?
Unless your child has a history of direct contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus, a history of travel to affected areas or is sick enough to be hospitalized, it is unlikely she will be tested.
"Availability of testing depends on where you are," Dr. O'Leary said. "Even in the best case scenario, you can't test everyone because there aren't enough test kits at this point." Older and higher-risk patients are being prioritized for testing because they tend to develop the most severe symptoms after infection.
If your child does get tested, it's unclear how quickly her results will come back -- and the time frame will most likely depend on where you are, which lab is testing her and how long she's been sick. "It's all over the map," Dr. O'Leary said. Anecdotally, he has heard about results taking anywhere from a few hours to seven days, depending on the state and the level of demand.
A greater number of labs will be able to provide testing in the coming days, according to Dr. O'Leary. But because there may also be increased demand, it's unclear whether that will speed up testing time overall.
Is it safe to take my child on public transportation?
Dr. Madan said she sees no reason to stop for the time being, unless you're in a place where officials recommend social distancing. While New York City hasn't officially recommended social distancing, it has urged commuters of all ages to avoid getting on packed subway cars and to walk or bike to work, if possible.
What if my child has a compromised immune system?
Because there isn't much information yet about how children react to this virus, it's tough to say what to do in this case, Dr. Hotez said. But Dr. Madan said that parents of children who have compromised immune systems should be taking it "day by day," though they should probably avoid crowded events like sports games or conferences, even if they're in places without community spread of the virus.
Should my family be taking any extra hygienic measures beyond hand washing?
You can wash bedsheets and towels more often. Jolie Kerr, a cleaning expert and frequent New York Times contributor, said that you could also wash stuffed animals more often (here's how) and clean hard toys with antibacterial wipes regularly -- particularly after outdoor use.
Should grandma still come visit?
Older adults, especially those who have compromised immune systems, may not want to travel right now, said Dr. Madan, since they seem to be most vulnerable to the new coronavirus. For more general guidance on whether you should cancel your family's travel plans, read our piece. The State Department is currently warning Americans not to travel on cruise ships at this time.

Texto completo: The Latin pop sensation Bad Bunny's surprise album debuted at No. 2.
The Atlanta rapper Lil Baby scored his first No. 1 on Billboard's album chart this week, with the omnipresent Latin pop star Bad Bunny starting close behind him.
Lil Baby's "My Turn," with appearances by Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert, Future and others, had the equivalent of 197,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. The vast majority of that activity came from streaming -- with 262 million clicks, "My Turn" had the biggest streaming week in six months, since Post Malone's "Hollywood's Bleeding" notched 365 million in September.
Lil Baby's rise has been quick. In four years, he has released seven full-length collections -- landing three others in the Top 5 -- and racked up more than 12 billion streams around the world.
Still, the 25-year-old has kept a relatively low profile, avoiding the Paris fashion shows and sometimes rolling up to a Chick-fil-A all alone.
"I just ain't into it," he said of the celebrity life in a recent interview with The New York Times. "I'm low-key bigger than the people who do that."
Also this week, Bad Bunny -- a hyper-connected Puerto Rican singer and rapper, who performed on Cardi B's No. 1 hit "I Like It" and was last seen onstage at the Super Bowl with Jennifer Lopez and Shakira -- landed at No. 2 with his latest album, the surprise release "YHLQMDLG." (The title stands for "Yo hago lo que me da la gana," or "I do what I want.") It had the equivalent of 179,000 sales, including 201 million streams.
Last week's top seller, "Map of the Soul: 7" by the K-pop sensation BTS, fell to No. 3. James Taylor's "American Standard" opened at No. 4, and Roddy Ricch's "Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial" holds at No. 5.

Scientists Urge Changes for Environmentally Damaging E.U. Farm Program

Texto completo: A planned overhaul fails to adequately protect the environment and support small farmers, a group of scientists said.
Europe's $ 65-billion-a-year farm program needs to change radically if it is to protect the environment and support small farmers, a group of European scientists said in a paper published in the journal "People and Nature" on Monday.
The 21 authors of the paper said a planned overhaul of Europe's farm policy is inadequate. They said policymakers must stop paying farmers based on the acres they cultivate and instead reward environmentally friendly practices such as organic farming or agroforestry. The scientists also asked the European Union to cut off subsidies that encourage livestock farming, which is linked to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions.
"Billions of euros of taxpayers' money are about to be poured down the drain," the scientists said in a statement.
A new Green Deal plans to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Last week, the European Commission outlined plans to make the deal legally binding for all member states.
But the package will not reform farming because it has adopted old policies and repackaged them as climate-friendly measures, the scientists said.
"The climate measures are unjustifiable. There is nothing in there," said Guy Pe'er, a German conservation biologist and the leading author of the paper.
"The commission is taking a step back backward," he said.
Mr. Pe'er has collected signatures from more than 3,600 scientists and researchers on his website supporting the paper's findings.
The scientists said that Europe's farm policy has sidelined small farmers and supported practices that have led to global warming, soil erosion, land degradation and the loss of biodiversity. Subsidy programs that could have curbed the damage have been paltry and underfunded.
Last year, a New York Times investigation showed the disconnect between Europe's green image and its farm policy, which has caused lasting environmental damage and left visible pockmarks across Europe. Decaying algae release deadly gas on some beaches in France. Farm runoff has helped expand dead zones in the Baltic Sea. And farmland emissions of greenhouse gas are on the rise.
The farm subsidies program accounts for nearly 40 percent of Europe's budget, making it one of the biggest in the world. It is riddled with corruption and self-dealing, especially in eastern and Central Europe, where leaders have diverted money to underwrite their governments or companies, the Times investigation found. Attempts to change the system or make it more accountable have failed partly because its biggest beneficiaries are in charge of setting policy.
For all the documented problems, leaders in Brussels have shown little interest in overhauling the policy. In January, the top European agricultural official promised to introduce anti-corruption measures in response to the Times investigation but did not provide any specifics.
And the new farm policy, which is being negotiated this year, will continue to use the land-for-money formula that favors those who own vast tracts. The formula has long been criticized for creating a modern feudal system in which small farmers can barely make a living.
Nearly a third of the payments go to "greening measures" designed to reduce emissions, preserve grassland and save wildlife. But commission officials have acknowledged that this has failed to accomplish much.
Under the new rules, member states will have more control over how much they invest in environmentally friendly measures. But critics say this is likely to encourage countries to opt for the easiest, "light-green" options because the policy does not have a clear scale to measure their successes or failures.
As long as policymakers in Brussels operate behind closed doors, small interest groups will have more influence on the outcome, according to Mr. Pe'er.
"This is really a power game," he said.
Mr. Pe'er said that policymakers ignored research on the farm policy's impact after spending "loads of money" on it.
"The scientific community is there to help," Mr. Pe'er said. "But for that, they need to listen."

Apple's iPhone Sales Numbers in China Drop Sharply
Apple's iPhone sales in China dropped by about 60 percent to roughly 500,000 devices last month from a year ago, according to Chinese government data, shedding more light on the impact of the coronavirus to the smartphone market. Overall smartphone sales fell by roughly 56 percent in the country in the same period.
Apple said last month that its revenue in the current quarter would be lower than forecast because of production delays and declining sales in China related to the outbreak. Since then, Apple has reopened stores in China, and Foxconn, which assembles most iPhones, said it expected to be back to full production rates by the end of March.
STOCKS
Markets Continue to Slip, Close In on Bear Territory
Some of the world's most important financial markets crossed into, or flirted with, bear market territory on Monday. That could augur an ugly week for those holding the world's wealth.
Japanese and Australian stocks finished bruising trading days down 20 percent from their recent highs -- the technical definition of a bear market, the flip side of the go-go bull market that has inspired memorials to surging capitalism. The drops represent billions of dollars in losses for some of the most valuable companies in both countries.
Stocks in Germany, France and Britain plunged on Monday, putting all three well into bear market territory, and shares in the United States were close.
Bear markets are rare and are sometimes seen as a harbinger of tougher economic times to come. Some notable bear markets in the United States include the one that ushered in the global financial crisis in 2007 and the dot-com bust in 2000.
TRADE
White House Lifts Tariffs on Surgical Masks and Other Medical Supplies
The Trump administration has exempted surgical gowns, masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and other medical products from the tariffs the president placed on China during the trade war, a move that will lower costs for hospitals and the government as they fight the coronavirus.
The affected products include gloves, infection control apparel and medical drapes made by Cardinal Health, isolation gowns, medical coveralls and patient cleansing wipes made by Medline Industries, and disposable pillow cases and specimen containers from Medegen Medical Products.
A spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative said the exclusions would apply retroactively from Sept. 1, 2019, when the tariffs were first put into effect, until Sept. 1, 2020.
AIRLINES
JetBlue Withdraws Its Earnings Estimates Amid Uncertainty
JetBlue said in a securities filing on Monday that it was withdrawing its earnings estimates for the first quarter and 2020 because of "ongoing uncertainty" caused by the coronavirus, which has contributed to a rapid recent decline in airline bookings.
JetBlue has said it is adjusting schedules through early May and considering reducing flights and spending, adjusting contracts and offering voluntary leave to workers.

Texto completo: When it opened in 1968, the play broke new ground in its depiction of gay characters.
Mart Crowley, whose 1968 play, "The Boys in the Band," put gay characters and their stories front and center in a way that had rarely been seen in a mainstream New York theater, died on Saturday night in Manhattan. He was 84.
His friend the actress Natasha Gregson Wagner said the cause was complications of heart surgery.
Where previous plays and movies often tiptoed around a character's homosexuality or, worse, demonized gay characters, Mr. Crowley's play presented gay men talking forthrightly and in depth about their lives. It featured nine men at a birthday party in which alcohol flowed and conversation grew brutally honest as a result.
"The power of the play," Clive Barnes wrote in his review in The New York Times, "is the way in which it remorselessly peels away the pretensions of its characters and reveals a pessimism so uncompromising in its honesty that it becomes in itself an affirmation of life."
The play, opening more than a year before the Stonewall Inn uprising in Greenwich Village, a catalyst of the gay-rights movement, gave new visibility to the world it depicted, with the show drawing both gay and straight audience members, including high-profile ones like Jacqueline Kennedy and Mayor John V. Lindsay. Staged at Theater Four on West 55th Street in Manhattan, it ran for more than two years and more than 1,000 performances.
Fifty years later, the play finally made it to Broadway, in a revival directed by Joe Mantello and with a cast that included Zachary Quinto. The production won the Tony Award for best revival.
"I think that was the highlight of his life," the actor Robert Wagner, Ms. Gregson Wagner's stepfather and Mr. Crowley's longtime friend, said in a phone interview.
Although groundbreaking, "The Boys in the Band," which was made into a movie directed by William Friedkin in 1970, was not universally embraced. With the gay-rights movement evolving quickly and vocally even as the play was still in the midst of its initial run, some critics attacked it as presenting an image of gay men that was unflattering and full of self-loathing.
"I went to see 'Boys in the Band' several times," Edward Albee said in the documentary "Making the Boys" (2011) by Crayton Robey, "and more and more I saw an audience there of straights, who were so happy to be able to see people they didn't have to respect."
Yet over time it has come to be seen as pivotal to opening up dialogue.
"The people who criticize the play," Mr. Mantello told The Times in 2018, "have the luxury to do so because of the play."
Edward Martino Crowley was born on Aug. 21, 1935, in Vicksburg, Miss. His father, he said later, was an alcoholic, and his mother was a drug addict.
"I always resented that Eugene O'Neill already had my best plots," he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2002.
He attended an all-boys Roman Catholic high school and graduated from the Catholic University of America in Washington in 1957 with a degree in theater. While there he designed a production of a stage adaptation of Herman Melville's "Billy Budd," whose cast included Jon Voight, a fellow student.
Mr. Crowley went to New York and was hired as an assistant by the director Elia Kazan. Kazan was filming "Splendor in the Grass," and Mr. Crowley befriended one of its stars, Natalie Wood (Ms. Gregson Wagner's mother). When she was cast in the film version of "West Side Story," Ms. Wood -- who was twice married to Mr. Wagner -- hired Mr. Crowley as her personal assistant.
In 1966, the critic Stanley Kauffmann wrote a provocative essay in The New York Times pointing out that although many leading playwrights were gay, their drama did not address their world directly.
"In society the homosexual's life must be discreetly concealed," he wrote. "As material for drama, that life must be even more intensely concealed."
Mr. Crowley, who had dabbled unsuccessfully in television writing, was among those struck by the essay's call for more open playwriting.
"Kauffman's article was, 'Isn't it about time that one of these homosexual writers writes a play that's openly about his own experience?"' he said in a 2013 interview on the television program "Theater Talk." "And I thought that was a very, very good point."

Mr. Crowley wrote "The Boys in the Band" in five weeks while house-sitting for the actress Diana Lynn. It was his first play. The New York production spawned productions in England and elsewhere.
"I ran around the world on 'Boys in the Band' money," he told The Washington Times in 1993.
Mr. Crowley wrote several other plays, including "The Men From the Boys," which looked in on the apartment and some of the characters from "The Boys in the Band" 30 years later.
Another Crowley drama, "For Reasons That Remain Unclear," involved an encounter between a priest and a younger man who share an unsettling past.
"The play has its hard nugget of truth," Lloyd Rose wrote in a review in The Washington Post when the play was staged at the Olney Theater in Maryland in 1993. "Crowley is more honest, and wiser about human nature, than many playwrights with more obvious and accessible writing skills."
Mr. Crowley leaves no immediate survivors.
In 2010, when "The Boys in the Band" was being revived by the Transport Group Off Broadway, several playwrights spoke of the work's influence on them. Larry Kramer had seen the play both in New York and in London.
"It was the London one that was life-changing in a way for me," he said, "because it showed me as a writer, as a gay person, as a gay writer, what was possible to do in the commercial theater. The theater in London was packed, and people loved the play and gave it a standing ovation."
Mr. Wagner, in the phone interview, said simply of his longtime friend, "He was his own man at a time when it was really, really difficult."

The Oprah seal of (dis)approval too; Winfrey's selections boosted sales from the start of her book club but also plenty of controversy too.

Texto completo: Oprah Winfrey first launched Oprah's Book Club on Sept. 16, 1996, 10 years into "The Oprah Winfrey Show," one of the highest-rated daytime talk shows in television history. The effect on book sales was immediate and impressive. Before Jacquelyn Mitchard's "The Deep End of the Ocean" became Winfrey's first pick, the publisher, Viking, had 100,000 copies in print; two weeks later, in its Sept. 30 issue, Publishers Weekly reported that number at 640,000. Fifteen years later, Nielsen reported that since it began tracking book sales through BookScan in 2001, Oprah's Book Club had sold 22 million copies of books it had picked. No marketing department could possibly compete with that.
Winfrey shuttered the original Book Club in December 2010, nearly half a year before "The Oprah Winfrey Show" ended its run, but it wasn't long before a reboot was in the works. Oprah's Book Club 2.0 named its first title on June 1, 2012; the picks were fewer and farther between but still, Oprah sold books. And when Apple announced that Winfrey would bring "Oprah's Book Club" to Apple TV+, it meant only one thing for the publishing industry: more sales.
As it turns out, it also meant more of something that has occasionally dogged the mogul and sometimes made her gun-shy: controversy. Recent events surrounding the selection of Jeanine Cummins' novel "American Dirt" not only signaled that her influence might be on the wane in the social-media era but it also harked back to old-media disputes of book clubs past. Below is an abbreviated history of Winfrey's most contentious picks.

--
Jonathan Franzen, 'The Corrections'
Winfrey chose Franzen's 2001 breakout novel for her book club in September 2001, two months before it won the National Book Award for fiction. Franzen filmed an interview with Winfrey that month, but before he was due to appear on the show, he criticized her in interviews, calling a number of her past selections "schmaltzy" and "one-dimensional" and worrying that male readers would avoid a book with the Oprah seal on the cover. Shortly afterward, Winfrey withdrew Franzen's invitation to the show. A stream of public apologies from Franzen -- thanking Winfrey for her "enthusiasm and advocacy" at the National Book Awards that November -- as well as a more effusive private letter -- didn't help.
--
James Frey, 'A Million Little Pieces'
Frey's now infamous 2003 not-quite-memoir was selected by Winfrey 21/2 years after its publication, in September 2005, and as the New York Times reported, it became "the fastest-selling book in the club's 10-year history." But four months later, the Smoking Gun website published an article detailing a number of fabrications in the supposedly true story. On the Jan. 26, 2006, episode of Winfrey's show, Frey returned to the set with his editor, Nan Talese, and Winfrey publicly skewered them both. "I feel duped. But more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers," Winfrey told Frey. And when Talese, prodded by Winfrey to explain herself, said Doubleday's legal department did not fact-check books, Winfrey replied, "Well, that needs to change." (For the most part, it hasn't.) Later, Winfrey reportedly apologized to Frey for inviting him and Talese to the show under false pretenses: Talese said they were invited back to join a panel discussion called "Truth in America," only to find that they were the only panelists.
--
Jonathan Franzen, 'Freedom'
Nine years after Franzen's public spat with Winfrey over "The Corrections," she selected his 2010 followup, "Freedom." Each told the other it was an "honor." And the hatchet was mostly buried. But Winfrey couldn't help noting that his dismissal of the show had led people to believe he was a "snob." "I am a Midwestern egalitarian," Franzen responded. "I do not think of myself as a snob." He also said, in a nonapology, that "the big thing I learned from the experience was to have more respect for television." He later told a journalist that he'd submitted to TV coaching, practiced his "onstage embrace" with Winfrey backstage and found her public reminder of the "Corrections" fracas "perfectly disingenuous." As he summed it up to the Wall Street Journal, "It was work. There were no disasters ... I think I like her more than she likes me."
--
Jeanine Cummins, 'American Dirt'
Winfrey's third pick for her new Apple TV+ fed a firestorm that was already raging around Cummins' thriller about a Mexican woman seeking refuge in America from a drug cartel. Flatiron Books had acquired the novel for seven figures and marketed it as a landmark work on Mexican immigration, earning widespread backlash from the Latinx literary community. Most prominent among the critics was author Myriam Gurba, who launched the debate into the public sphere via a widely circulated review arguing that Cummins was appropriating Mexican American experiences. A number of authors signed a public petition asking Winfrey to rescind her pick in late January. Gurba and three others launched a Latinx literary advocacy group, #DignidadLiteraria, and requested a private sit-down with Oprah, who could "join us on a mission of repair." (Winfrey's representatives reportedly were conferenced in on a conversation between #DignidadLiteraria and Flatiron owners Macmillan last month via phone, but otherwise have not engaged with the group.)
Winfrey released two episodes of "Oprah's Book Club" on Friday. Cummins and three Latina writers -- Reyna Grande, Julissa Arce and Esther Cepeda -- joined Winfrey onstage while Cummins' editor, Amy Einhorn, and Macmillan President Don Weisberg weighed in from the audience. Notably missing were representatives from #DignidadLiteraria, and Cepeda told Winfrey, "I wish Myriam Gurba was here to speak for herself." She followed up by asking if Winfrey would engage with the group. "I can't say what my engagement is going to be," Winfrey replied. "What I can say is I'm going to do better in terms of my own selection." Some in the media and on Twitter have responded positively to the conversation. Others have said it did not go far enough, and #DignidadLiteraria condemned the episodes in a statement, calling the conversations an attempt to "quash our campaign of dignity."

Kate Elizabeth Russell, 'My Dark Vanessa' -- dropped
Shortly after the "American Dirt" controversy blew up, another began to grow over Russell's "My Dark Vanessa," a novel about a 15-year-old girl's relationship with a predatory boarding-school teacher that also sold for seven figures. In an essay in Gay magazine, writer Wendy C. Ortiz criticized publishers for elevating white voices over nonwhite authors, citing her 2014 memoir, "Excavation," about her own sexual abuse as a teenager, as an example. While stopping short of accusing Russell of plagiarism, Ortiz alluded to "eerie similarities" between the books. Later, Russell outed herself as an abuse survivor online, perhaps to emphasize that the novel arose from her own life. The publisher had pushed the book's publication date from January to March after learning that it was to be Winfrey's next pick. Last week, however, "Oprah's Book Club" abruptly dropped it. As O magazine books editor Leigh Haber said, "We are going to be very cognizant of wanting the selections not to create noise around the book that prevent her from discussing the book." It seems one controversy this year was enough.

Sanders gains endorsement from Jackson in Michigan

Texto completo: The Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for president Sunday, offering support that the senator and his team hope will rally black voters to their side before a key primary race in Michigan.
“With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States, and our needs are not moderate," Jackson, a longtime civil rights activist and presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988, said in a statement. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.
“The Biden campaign has not reached out to me or asked for my support," he added. “The Sanders campaign has, and they responded to the issues I raised."
Speaking before thousand of voters gathered in the western Michigan city of Grand Rapids, Sanders lavished praise on Jackson, citing his insurgent bid for the White House in 1988, when he became a leading candidate before ultimately losing to Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
“It is one of the honors of my life to be supported by a man who has put his life on the line for the last 50 years fighting for justice," he told a largely white crowd of thousands gathered for an outdoor rally. “Everything that Jesse Jackson said is what this campaign is about."
Sanders has cast his two presidential campaigns in the lineage of Jackson's 1988 presidential bid, telling advisers in 2015 that he hoped to model his 2016 operation after that effort. Political contemporaries, the two septuagenarian liberal activists are longtime allies: In 1988, Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vt., was slapped by an “irate citizen" after supporting Jackson in the state's caucuses.
Michigan's caucuses that year marked a high point for Jackson's campaign. He beat Dukakis in the state by building support among black voters and liberal white caucusgoers.
New York Times
In this era of coronavirus, rallies to continue, for now
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — As the coronavirus hits more states, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday his campaign is gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health specialists say could be breeding grounds to spread the potentially deadly illness.
“Obviously what is most important to us is to protect the health of the American people," Sanders said as he appeared in a series of TV interviews. “And what I will tell you, we are talking to public health officials all over this country."
“This is an issue that every organization, every candidate has got to deal with," he said.
Federal health authorities have been advising older people and those with medical conditions, in particular, to avoid crowded spaces, prompting the cancellation of music and arts festivals and other events around the country.
But that so far hasn't led President Trump or his two remaining major Democratic rivals, Sanders and Joe Biden, to cut back on big campaign events. Each man is in his 70s.
Sanders said “in the best of all possible worlds" the three candidates should probably limit their travel and avoid crowds, “but right now, we're running as hard as we can."
Trump on Saturday said he wasn't worried about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House after the first case in the nation's capital was confirmed over the weekend.
The Trump campaign said Sunday it is “proceeding as normal" amid the outbreak, though it has yet to announce the president's next rally.
New York Times
Trump to skip St. Patrick's luncheon on Capitol Hill
Irish eyes at the US Capitol will not smile on President Trump on St. Patrick's Day.
Trump is skipping an annual bipartisan luncheon with House and Senate lawmakers celebrating the ties that bind the United States and Ireland, a White House spokesman said.
Trump blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Since the speaker has chosen to tear this nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the president will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity," spokesman Judd Deere said in an e-mailed statement.
The House speaker traditionally hosts the luncheon.
Trump instead will celebrate with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House on Thursday — five days before St. Patrick's Day.

Trump tweets a meme of himself fiddling, drawing a comparison to Roman emperor Nero

Texto completo: President Trump looked serene as he rested the left side of his face against the violin. The meme showed him with his eyes closed and seemingly relaxed playing the instrument amid mounting concerns of the global spread of the novel coronavirus.
"My next piece is called," the meme said in bold white letters, "nothing can stop what's coming."
When Trump tweeted the image on Sunday night, he said that while he appreciated the sentiment of the meme he was sharing from White House social media director Dan Scavino, he did not exactly understand the meaning behind it.
"Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!" Trump tweeted.
The symbolism of the image and language, however, was enough for many to form their own conclusions surrounding recent events. Trump sharing the image was looked at by critics as an allusion to the legend of Roman emperor Nero who fiddled as Rome burned around him. Others pointed out that the line "Nothing can stop what's coming" is a popular phrase linked to the far-right online conspiracy theory QAnon, whose followers have made their fringe presence known at the president's rallies and have had their content promoted by Trump.
The meme came as the number of coronavirus cases in the United States topped 500 over the weekend, before the Dow sustained heavy losses Monday thanks to a new oil war sparked by the outbreak. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
The image reminiscent of Nero trended on Twitter into early Monday, and only intensified when people learned that the president played golf at his club Sunday in West Palm Beach, Fla., with players from the Washington Nationals.
"It means Rome is burning and you're fiddling around a golf course, Nero," replied Walter Shaub, a Trump critic and former director of the Office of Government Ethics.
Washington Post
Manipulated Biden video escalates online speech war
A manipulated video featuring Joe Biden and spread by President Trump over the weekend has ratcheted up an online war that has put Twitter and Facebook in the middle of a debate over political speech.
The campaigns have fought for months over misinformation targeting Biden, and the latest salvo has taken on greater import with his surge in the Democratic primaries.
In response to such misinformation, the tech platforms have written new and diverging rules on political speech. On Sunday, Twitter tagged the video in question as manipulated content, while Facebook left the video intact without any flags about the false content.
The video came from a stump speech by Biden on Saturday in Kansas City, Mo., where he appeared to struggle through a sentence and with halting words said, “We can only reelect Donald Trump."
But the rest of Biden's sentence was selectively edited out. In full, Biden was stressing the need for Democrats to unite against Trump.
The president's reelection campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.
After users flagged the video to Twitter on Sunday, the company said it had determined the video violated its rules against synthetic and manipulated video and labeled the video as manipulated content. By that point, it had been viewed more than 5 million times and retweeted more than 20,000 times.
It was the first time Twitter had applied a policy announced in February against fake and misleading videos. Facebook, however, did not remove or flag the video as misinformation, angering the Biden campaign. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ex- presidential candidate Cory Booker endorses Biden
Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, endorsed Joe Biden for president Monday, adding to what has become a nearly complete consolidation of support from Biden's former top rivals to push him to the Democratic nomination.
Booker's endorsement comes one day after Senator Kamala Harris of California endorsed Biden, and the two senators will appear with him at a rally in Detroit on Monday night.
Booker will also campaign alongside Biden in Flint, Mich., earlier in the day and attend a fund-raiser with him.
The event in Michigan, which holds its delegate-heavy primary Tuesday, will be yet another public show of moderate Democratic support for the former vice president on the eve of a major vote in the presidential race.
Biden also picked up two major endorsements, as two national gun control advocacy groups — Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign — announced their support.

Texto completo: BY MICHAEL WARREN
The Associated Press
ATLANTA - Sixty years have passed since Roslyn Pope came home from Europe to a segregated South and channeled her frustrations into writing "An Appeal for Human Rights."
The document published on March 9, 1960, announced the formation of the Atlanta Student Movement, whose campaign of civil disobedience broke a suffocating stalemate over civil rights in Atlanta and hastened the end of racist Jim Crow laws and policies across the region.
After all this time, Pope is deeply concerned that their hard-won achievements are slipping away.
"We have to be careful. It's not as if we can rest and think that all is well," Pope told The Associated Press in an interview last week.
The "Appeal" quickly became a civil rights manifesto after it appeared as a full-page advertisement in Atlanta's newspapers. It was denounced by Georgia's segregationist Gov. Ernest Vandiver but celebrated around the country, reprinted for free in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times and entered into the Congressional Record.
The idea was to explain why black students would defy their parents, professors and police by illegally occupying whites-only spaces. It decried the racist laws governing education, jobs, housing, voting, hospitals, theaters, restaurants, and law enforcement. It called on "all people of good will to assert themselves and abolish these injustices."
"Every normal human being wants to walk the earth with dignity and abhors any and all proscriptions placed upon him because of race or color," it said. "We do not intend to wait placidly for those rights which are already legally and morally ours to be meted out to us one at a time."
The students meant what they said, persuading Atlanta's black families to boycott segregated stores and theaters and repeatedly seek service in places where the color of their skin meant they weren't allowed. Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., they committed countless acts of nonviolent protest and were arrested by the hundreds throughout that spring and summer.
Pope went on to teach religion, music and English literature to generations of college students in New York, Pennsylvania and Texas while raising two daughters.
The "Appeal" has followed her all along, she said: "It's just as relevant now as when I wrote it."
Racism, Pope said, "is such obvious evil. And it seems to me that people don't try to hide it so much anymore."
"I just had a lovely great-granddaughter born in September, and I just hope things will be better for her," she said. "Maybe we'll have different leadership and people's lives will have been changed. But I'm not terribly optimistic."

Texto completo: Today is Monday, March 9, the 69th day of 2020. There are 297 days left in the year.
On this date:
In 1841, the U.S. Supreme Court, in United States v. The Amistad, ruled, 7-1, in favor of a group of illegally enslaved Africans who seized control of a Spanish schooner, La Amistad; the justices ruled that the Africans should be set free.
In 1916, more than 400 Mexican raiders led by Pancho Villa attacked Columbus, N.M., killing
18 Americans.
In 1959, Mattel's Barbie doll made its public debut at the American International Toy Fair in New York.
In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court, in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, raised the standard for public officials to prove they'd been libeled in their official capacity by news organizations.
In 1976, a cable car in the Italian ski resort of Cavalese fell some 700 feet to the ground when a supporting line snapped, killing 43 people.
In 1981, Dan Rather made his debut as principal anchorman of "The CBS Evening News."
In 1987, Chrysler Corp. announced it had agreed to buy the financially ailing American Motors Corp.
In 1989, the Senate rejected President George H.W. Bush's nomination of John Tower to be defense secretary by a vote of 53-47. (The next day, Bush tapped Wyoming Rep. Dick Cheney, who went on to win unanimous Senate approval.)
In 1997, gangsta rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (Christopher Wallace) was killed in a still-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles; he was 24.
In 2005, Dan Rather signed off for the last time as principal anchorman of "The CBS Evening News."
In 2009, President Barack Obama lifted George W. Bush-era limits on using federal dollars for embryonic stem cell research.
Ten years ago: Vice President Joe Biden, visiting Israel, condemned an Israeli plan to build hundreds of homes in east Jerusalem. Former television producer Robert "Joe" Halderman pleaded guilty in New York to attempted grand larceny for trying to blackmail talk show host David Letterman. (Halderman was sentenced to six months in jail; he actually served four.) Doris "Granny D" Haddock, a New Hampshire woman who'd walked across the country at age 89 to promote campaign finance reform, died at age 100.
Five years ago: In northwestern Argentina, two helicopters collided and burst into flames shortly after taking off near the remote settlement of Villa Castelli, killing both pilots and eight French nationals. (Among the victims were Olympic champion swimmer Camille Muffat (moo-FAY'), Olympic bronze-medalist boxer Alexis Vastine and pioneering sailor Florence Arthaud, who were contestants on a European reality TV show which was being shot in the sparsely populated region.) Solar Impulse 2, a Swiss-made solar-powered aircraft, took off from Abu Dhabi just after daybreak in a historic first attempt to fly around the world without a drop of fossil fuel (however, overheated batteries grounded the plane in Hawaii). Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the Apple Watch in San Francisco.
One year ago: R&B singer R. Kelly walked out of a Chicago jail after someone who officials said did not want to be publicly identified paid $161,000 that Kelly owed in back child support. (Kelly would be arrested in July and ordered held without bond as he awaited sex-related charges in Chicago and New York.) Julia Ruth Stevens, the last surviving daughter of Hall of Fame baseball slugger Babe Ruth, died at an assisted living facility in Nevada at the age of 102; she had been a decades-long champion of Ruth's legacy.
Today's Birthdays: Former Sen. James L. Buckley, Conservative-N.Y., is 97. Singer Lloyd Price is 87. Actress Joyce Van Patten is 86. Country singer Mickey Gilley is 84. Actress Trish Van Devere is 79. Singer-musician John Cale (The Velvet Underground) is 78. Singer Mark Lindsay (Paul Revere and the Raiders) is 78. Former ABC anchorman Charles Gibson is 77.

Texto completo: Henry Cobb
NEW YORK - Architect Henry N. Cobb, who designed the tallest building in New England, has died. He was 93.
Cobb died last Monday at his Manhattan home, according to his firm, Pei Cobb Freed & Partners.
The most celebrated building of Cobb's 70-year career was the 800-foot-tall glass skyscraper now called 200 Clarendon but still widely known as the John Hancock Tower in Boston.
Landscape architect Laurie Olin, who worked with Cobb on several projects, called him "an architect's architect.
Cobb was born in Boston on April 8, 1926, and grew up in Brookline. He studied at Harvard's Graduate School of Design where he first met prominent architect I.M. Pei, who was his teacher. Cobb moved to New York in 1950 to start his career in skyscraper architecture but then designed multiple buildings in Boston, including Harbor Towers and the John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse and Harborpark.
Cobb also designed the Place Ville Marie in Montreal, the campus of the State University of New York Fredonia, and the Johnson & Johnson world headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
Though the Hancock Tower - often confused with Chicago's John Hancock Center - ended up becoming a Boston icon on par with the Old North Church, it wasn't immediately accepted.
Many people protested plans because it was close to beloved Copley Square. Then, as construction neared completion in 1972, glass panels weighing as much as 500 pounds each started falling from the facade.
Many Bostonians called the falling glass "retribution for overreaching," Cobb told The New York Times in 2010.
The firm ordered replacement glass, but the bad publicity and litigation costs nearly drove the Pei firm to financial ruin. Cobb focused primarily on designing office buildings as the firm rebounded.
Survivors include his wife, Joan; three daughters; and three grandchildren.

Texto completo: We’ve used the terms “liberal” and “conservative” to discuss American ideological and policy matters for my entire life, but I’ve often been struck by the fuzziness of both terms.
In fact, “liberal,” which means sort of center-left in American usage, means pretty far right in many other countries. Conservative used to refer to a perhaps healthy reluctance to change things too radically or too fast.
With the Trump takeover of the supposedly more conservative of our two major parties, the idea that there is anything cautious about the Trumpian version of conservatism, or “Republicanism” in a tradition that has meant many things from Lincoln to Reagan, is now laughable. If Trumpism is the latest model of conservatism, the term has lost any connection to what I thought of as the enduring meaning of conservatism.
Which brings me to a fine illustration of the difference between old-fashioned principled, rational conservatism – the kind that I, as a lifelong “liberal,” have long respected if not embraced, as opposed to the bizarre new Trumpist version of the C-word.
It came in a Saturday column by New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, who has been classified as a “conservative” voice in the Times lineup, but who now finds himself hoping for a Joe Biden presidency in 2021 because, while Bernie Sanders is way too far left for Stephens, he seems to hold the prospect of four more years of the current incumbent as equally dreadful.
Personally, I don’t share his dread of Sanders. And even those who think Sanders’ brand of “democratic socialism” is too extreme should take comfort that many of his leftiest ideas could not be enacted by any Congress likely to be elected in the foreseeable future.
But Stephens’ column, above all, was a conservative’s list of problems and horrors that the election of an old-fashioned moderately liberal Biden would spare the country from, compared with four more years of the incumbent, who, in Stephens’ expert conservative opinion, is no conservative at all.
An excerpt from that portion of his argument, from Stephens’ column of Saturday:
If Biden wins the White House, I won’t have to worry about the president trying to criminalize his political opponent. Not with demagogic chants of ‘Lock her up,’ nor with quiet attempts to strong-arm an ally for the sake of digging up dirt on an American citizen. I won’t have to worry about White House officials being forced to choose between their ethical obligations and their loyalty to the president. I won’t have to worry about an attorney general who chooses loyalty over obligation — and, a year later, is bluntly reprimanded by a Republican-appointed federal judge for doing so.
If Biden wins, I won’t have to fear that the president might order the abrogation of a free-trade agreement with a major trading partner — only for a watchful adviser to snatch the order from his desk before he can sign it. I won’t have to read about frantic aides wondering if the president is really serious about his threats to withdraw the U.S. from NATO. I won’t have to cross my fingers hoping that a clever general will convince the president that the reason we shouldn’t betray our desperate Kurdish allies in Syria is so we can keep the oil. …
If Biden wins, I will write column after column opposing him on policy grounds. But at least I’ll feel relief that the American people didn’t vindicate Trumpism and the nativism and meanness it represents. …
If Biden wins, it will not mean a great American presidency. It will mean a decent one. That will be more than enough for me.
The full Stephens column is viewable here.
I’m sure I don’t agree with Stephens on many substantive policy issues. But I hope his column represents the thinking of enough rational conservatives of good conscience to make a difference in November.

Texto completo: As of 12 p.m. Wednesday, March 11, test results show that no Mainers have tested positive so far for the coronavirus. For the latest coronavirus news, click here.
With the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continuing to grow around the country and world, the University of Maine System is working to allow students to keep taking classes online even if they are quarantined or their physical classrooms need to be closed down over health concerns.
"There are no plans to shutter any campuses right now and the university system doesn't have a date for moving everything online," said spokesperson Dan Demeritt. "But we're making preparations for being able to do that."
No cases of COVID-19 have yet been confirmed in Maine, but it has been detected in every other New England state and health officials have said there is a strong chance it will also arrive here.
The University of Maine System's preparations have included working with instructors to make sure they can deliver lessons using a variety of online programs and resources, but Demeritt said that figuring out how to remotely offer experiential classes such as science labs has been more of a challenge. He added that the system already offers many courses online.
Some universities on the East Coast, such as Columbia and Princeton universities, have already announced they'll be moving to remote classes out of concern for the virus, according to the New York Times. Boston University announced Monday that it was instructing faculty to prepare to teach classes remotely in the event campus needs to be shutdown for an emergency.
[Related: Do you have questions about the coronavirus? Ask us here.]
Demeritt said that having the ability to temporarily move all classes online could help the University of Maine System in other situations, such as if there is heavy snow during the week of final exams. He also said that system administrators are continuing to speak regularly and consult with state health officials for updates about the coronavirus
Chancellor Dannel Malloy addressed the need for such preparations in a Feb. 28 memo on the system's website.
"We are not overreacting," he said. "We are preparing. There is no reason yet to expect that any campus closures will be needed. We will continue to monitor medical advances and prevention efforts intended to prevent coronavirus from requiring pandemic responses. Still, an actionable continuity of instruction plan is the right thing to have, and we intend to be ready to limit risks associated with infectious disease or other emergency situations."
Last week, the University of Maine System announced that 14 of its students who were participating in three study abroad programs in Italy were leaving the country after the U.S. issued a travel advisory because of the high number of coronavirus cases there.
The system would not disclose the health of those students, but Demeritt said that they are remaining isolated for a period of time under federal guidelines. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise Americans who have returned from Italy to remain home for 14 days and seek medical care if they have fever, a cough, or trouble breathing.
Those students were not among more than a dozen people that the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has so far tested for COVID-19, according to agency spokesman Robert Long. Under federal criteria, patients must show those types of symptoms and receive the approval of a doctor to qualify for a COVID-19 test.
With the University of Maine System's spring break coming up next week, it has also been issuing additional travel advice and referring students and staff to guidance from the U.S. CDC.
It has asked students and workers to voluntarily disclose any international travel they have done or are planning to do, and it has encouraged them to reconsider any domestic or international travel "if you are concerned for your safety."
It has also reminded them about travel advisories the U.S. government has set for China, Iran, Italy and South Korea. On Monday, it said in a memo that federal health guidelines call for people returning from those countries to be quarantined for 14 days.

Kamala Harris would be a nightmare pick for Biden attorney general

Texto completo: Just a few weeks ago, it looked like Joe Biden’s presidential campaign was done. Now, after a drastic change in the candidate’s fortunes on Super Tuesday, we’re already imagining what the cabinet of the new favorite for the Democratic nomination would look like if he wins the White House. And at least as far as attorney general is concerned, Biden’s possible cabinet is frightening indeed.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, both Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat who just endorsed Biden, and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates are being considered as possible picks to head the Justice Department. As far as Harris is concerned, this speculation is only further fueled by how she just pulled a complete 180-degree reversal and went from lobbing charges of racism at Biden to endorsing him for the nomination. But let’s be clear: Regardless of however you may feel about a Biden administration, the prospect of Harris as attorney general should terrify you. Tweet
The former California state attorney general has already shown herself to be an overzealous cop willing to trample over the rights of innocent and disadvantaged people and abuse her prosecutorial power for political gain. The prospect of handing Harris the reins to the DOJ should give pause to anyone remotely concerned with civil liberties or bothered by miscarriages of justice. That the Biden camp would even consider such an atrocious pick raises serious questions about its judgment.
Let’s recap Harris’s nightmare tenure as California attorney general.
She once laughed in the face of a journalist who asked her about legalizing marijuana and prosecuted untold numbers of nonviolent offenders for drug possession as attorney general despite admitting to having smoked marijuana herself. Harris’s office also tried to keep inmates locked up not for any criminal purposes but rather so the state could maintain its supply of cheap labor. Yes, seriously.
Harris also fought to uphold wrongful convictions obtained through illegal means. And she defended cash bail, a manifestly unfair system that imprisons people based on their relative level of wealth, not the seriousness of their crime, as they await trial.
Oh, and don’t forget about all the single mothers Harris gleefully prosecuted for their children’s truancy (because putting parents in jail surely helps the situation). According to the New York Times, “Ms. Harris also championed state legislation under which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school could be prosecuted, despite concerns that it would disproportionately affect low-income people of color.”
As fellow 2020 contender Tulsi Gabbard put it in her debate-stage takedown of Harris, “When you were in a position to make a difference, you did not. The people who suffered under your reign as a prosecutor, you owe them an apology.” Gabbard is right: Harris deserves denunciation for her atrocious record as a prosecutor — not a promotion to the highest prosecutor job in the land.

There's nothing 'democratic' about Bernie Sanders's 'democratic socialism'

Texto completo: Is there a reason why we’re all acting like there’s some stark distinction between socialism and “democratic socialism”?
The national media take such pains to ensure that their audiences are never under the impression that Bernie Sanders is a socialist-socialist but instead a democratic socialist, and I can only imagine it’s because they think placing the word “democratic” at the beginning makes it sound pleasant.
The tendency was best captured last month on MSNBC when journalist A.B. Stoddard said that Democrats were likely going to suffer should they nominate “a socialist.”
With the reflexes of a Serengeti cat, anchor Stephanie Ruhle pounced. “A democratic socialist,” she said in an effort to correct Stoddard. “That is not the same as a socialist.”
“Whatever,” replied Stoddard.
“It’s not a whatever.”
But it actually is "a whatever." If a “democratic socialist” is different in some profound way from a socialist-socialist, I’ve yet to hear what that difference is. The East German communists called their country the German Democratic Republic. Did that make it so?
The website for the Democratic Socialists of America defines what they believe, and anyone who reads it can’t possibly come away believing there’s any divergence from standard, everyday socialism, and whatever it is that the Vermont senator is trying to sell.
The site says, “We believe that the workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own and control them”; that “the economy and society should be run democratically — to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few” and that major industries should “run as cooperatives.”
Democratic socialism really is just socialism, or even "communism," a word that was once a synonym for socialism before socialist regimes began using it to describe the future paradise of perfect socialism.
“To meet public needs, not to make profits for a few” is nothing more than the Kidz Bop rendition of, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.” And to socialists, strangely, that's actually what democracy means. It isn't about voting; it's about redistributing economic power by redistributing other people's property.
The DSA asserts with enthusiasm that “democratic socialism” is not about establishing an “all-powerful government bureaucracy” and that, indeed, democratic socialists “have been among the harshest critics of authoritarian Communist states.”
But how do these people think their fantasy world works? Who’s going to ensure that Tim Cook steps down as CEO and hands the keys to the kingdom to the janitors who wipe down the Apple stores each night? Who’s going to make certain that Tesla is producing its cars “to meet public needs”?
That’s going to require government force — a lot of it.
And yet the media continue to qualify Sanders’s ideology as if it’s any different than standard socialism as it's been defined for centuries.
An Associated Press report on Monday referred to Sanders’ “avowed democratic socialist ideology.”
The New York Times on Sunday described Sanders as “the democratic socialist.”
The Washington Post on Saturday called him “the democratic socialist from Vermont.”
Why is his ideology being given this qualification? Sanders himself has made no serious distinction between socialism and what it is he’s advocating for. That is free education at public universities, free health insurance via government-run Medicare, free state-run child care, and guaranteed government jobs.
What’s left for him to do for the media to make the leap from describing him as “democratic socialist” to just plain “socialist”?
There was never any difference.

For my family, coronavirus can't get here soon enough

Texto completo: I’ve been to countless Black Friday events, and they don't hold a candle to what I witnessed and experienced during a shopping trip to Costco last weekend. Shelves were emptied. Customers swarmed the bottled water and toilet paper aisles, picking them clean almost instantly. At one point, I couldn't move my cart in any direction at all as a stampede of people pushed my wife and me forward toward the checkout lines.
I knew everyone around me was panicking because of the coronavirus, but my young family of six isn't dreading the disease at all. We just want to get it over with.
Since the virus was first discovered in China at the close of 2019, news headlines have unfolded like jump-scare scenes in a horror film: "You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus," "Diamond Princess crew 'desperate for help' as virus tightens grip," "Coronavirus Is Declared a Global Health Emergency," "Chicago man is first US case of person-to-person Coronavirus spread," "Here Comes the Coronavirus Pandemic," "Prepare for the worst," and so on.
With each new revelation the stock market plummets, the travel industry grinds closer to a halt, and the level of global panic skyrockets.
And for what? According to the New York Times, the death rate crom coronavirus everywhere throughout China outside of Hubei Province -- where the disease originated -- is just 0.4%. And "the true fatality rate could be even lower," because the majority of infected people probably don't even know they have it since they don't "show any symptoms at all."
Conversely, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center recently told USA Today that coronavirus is just a "blip on the horizon" and a "trivial risk" compared to the flu. The CDC confirmed that the flu killed "an estimated 80,000 Americans" just two winters ago -- not to mention the 646,000 people who die every year from it worldwide - with nary a headline.
What's more, everyone who gets the flu each season feels like they have the flu, whereas "more than 80% of coronavirus infections are pretty mild," and "no more severe than the common cold," according to NPR. One article in the New York Times recently said that for the majority of coronavirus victims, the symptoms go "unrecognized" and "could be just as small as a sore throat" and in "one or two days, it's gone."
Another important distinction about coronavirus is that it affects each age group very differently. According to NPR, the number of children who have become infected with coronavirus is "remarkably low,” with many infected children "developing no symptoms at all." And the BBC reported that of the more than 3,000 coronavirus deaths so far, only eight have occurred in people under 30 -- none at all in children age 10 and under. In fact, more than 80% of all Coronavirus deaths have occurred in persons 60 years and older, frequently as a result of preexisting heart conditions.
Which brings me to why my family isn't afraid of this virus and why we want to get it over with instead of prolonging the inevitable. Per the New York Times, "Several medical experts have said that those who have been infected with the Coronavirus will not become infected again, as their bodies will produce antibodies that provide immunity." Dr. Lu Hongzhou told Beijing News that “As long as the virus doesn’t evolve, there is no chance of being infected again.”
In spite of this information, many are still treating this virus like it's some kind of Biblical plague. That's especially surprising considering how many times we've recently been here before. Zika, Swine Flu, Ebola, MERS, and SARS all had their day in the media spotlight and all caused a global panic. All but one of those diseases are still alive and well today. In every case, mankind eventually did what we always do: we accepted the new reality and moved on.
That's already starting to happen where all of this began as the number of new Coronavirus cases in China has dropped significantly, and continues to drop every day. America - and the rest of the world - will get there eventually as well but not before things get a little bit worse here first.
In the meantime I'll remain flabbergasted by the way so many overreact to a virus that kills so few, doesn’t harm our young, and feels like nothing more than the common cold -- when it feels like anything at all -- for more than 80% of its victims.
Coronavirus may never actually impact my family at all, but if it ever does I hope it happens sooner rather than later. The drip-drip-drip of daily anticipation and ensuing madness is going to do far more damage in the end.

Texto completo: Sen. Cory Booker backed Joe Biden for president, adding another former rival to the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner’s list of endorsements.
“Joe Biden won’t only win — he’ll show there’s more that unites us than divides us,” Booker said in a tweet early Monday. “He’ll restore honor to the Oval Office and tackle our most pressing challenges.”
The endorsement comes nearly 24 hours after Sen. Kamala Harris said she would support Biden for the Democratic nomination.
The two senators will reportedly appear with Biden at a rally in Detroit on Monday night. Booker will also campaign with Biden in Flint, Michigan, and attend a fundraiser with him.
It’s another strong show of support for Biden on the eve of a major voting day in the presidential primaries. A week ago, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke appeared with Biden in Texas to offer their support ahead of Super Tuesday.
The backing of Booker and Harris, two prominent black candidates to run for president, helps give Biden an extra boost as his rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, tries to hang on in Michigan, where black voters make up a sizable portion of the electorate.
Booker dropped out of the presidential race in January as he struggled to compete financially and in the polls with top-tier campaigns.

Trump has met his Hurricane Katrina, media declare for the umpteenth time

Texto completo: An MSNBC roundtable agreed this weekend that President Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak could be his Katrina moment, a reference, of course, to President George W. Bush’s much-maligned handling of the 2005 hurricane of the same name.

At this rate, Trump has suffered something like a dozen Katrinas, according to members of the press, and he has not even served a full term in office.

“I was thinking of this in terms of politics,” said MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude Jr. “We talked about the business community finally not kind of sticking with Donald Trump. But this may be, and, Nicolle, I should mention this with a little trepidation, but this may be Donald Trump's Katrina.”

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who worked for the Bush administration, said with a smile, “Let's just lean into that for a minute. I mean, Katrina was the moment when all the things that felt incredibly incompetent about the Bush presidency ... were realized. We gave them a proof point that we were indeed incompetent and, also, people died. This has the making, structurally, for the same kind of moment.”

“If there's any a moment to shake that 40%, the folks who would allow [Trump] to shoot someone [on Fifth Avenue]. If there's any moment, it's this one,” Glaude said, “because it's babies. It's friends. It's loved ones. It's old, helpless grandparents. It's your nana. So, it seems to me this is an event that could take down a president.”NW
They are not wrong when they say the coronavirus outbreak has the potential to cause incredible harm in the United States. It may even be the thing that (finally) does in the Trump presidency. But, if the Wallace and Glaude back-and-forth sounds familiar, it should. For nearly every mishap that has happened since Trump's inauguration in January 2017, there has been someone in the news media to declare it his Katrina.

“Could Harvey be Trump's Katrina?” asked an op-ed published by the Christian Science Monitor in 2017.

The New York Times asked elsewhere before the hurricane had even fully settled, “How Does Harvey Compare With Hurricane Katrina?”

“12 years ago today, Katrina hit. Here's how it compares with Harvey,” read a headline published a day later by CNN.

A Chicago Sun-Times op-ed declared later that same year of a different weather event, “Hurricane Maria is Trump’s Hurricane Katrina.”

“How Puerto Rico Is Becoming Trump’s Katrina,” Rolling Stone magazine declared of the same disaster.

Asked Vanity Fair, “Is the Crisis in Puerto Rico Becoming Trump's Katrina?”

Members of the press were really invested that year in making the comparison.

Later, in 2018, the Atlantic’s Mallika Rao wrote on the “emotive images” of illegal immigrant families being separated at the border for an article titled “Trump’s Katrina Moment.”

Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson wrote elsewhere that year for the Guardian, “The forced separation of families is Trump's 'Katrina moment.’”

CNN’s chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the border crisis is “Trump’s Katrina.”

Wallace herself hosted a segment in 2018 titled “Why Family Separations May Be President Donald Trump’s ‘Katrina Moment.’”

Mercifully, we got a break from Katrina comparisons for most of 2019. But then, the coronavirus outbreak became a major international issue, so now, news media are back to referencing the 2005 hurricane that did irreparable damage to Louisiana and the Bush presidency.

It is a cliche, at this point, to say Trump is facing his own Katrina. We have done this so many times already that continued uses of the reference threaten to devalue the seriousness of the situations to which they are being applied.

You can cry “wolf” only so many times.

Texto completo: President Trump’s campaign postponed a “Women for Trump” bus tour amid concerns about the coronavirus.
The three-day bus tour through Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania was supposed to start Monday, but the trip was quietly called off after an advisory was sent out last week, according to the New York Times.
The tour featured Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump, Kayleigh McEnany, a campaign spokeswoman, and Mercedes Schlapp, a former White House adviser whose husband oversees the Conservative Political Action Conference, where an attendee tested positive for coronavirus.
A campaign spokeswoman said it had been postponed because of “scheduling conflicts.” However, two people familiar with the situation said the decision was made after Schlapp moved to postpone the tour because of the CPAC attendee. Schlapp’s husband, Matt Schlapp, interacted with the infected attendee during the conference.
Erin Perinne, a campaign spokeswoman, told the New York Times the story was “untrue” that the event was postponed because of Schlapp.
The president said last week he would continue to hold his campaign rallies despite the outbreak, but none are currently scheduled.

Indian Wells tennis tournament canceled because of coronavirus outbreak

Texto completo: The BNP Paribas Open in Southern California, one of the world’s leading tennis tournaments, will not be held this month because of the spreading coronavirus, making it one of the highest-profile sporting events canceled in the outbreak.
Organizers of the event, in the Riverside County community of Indian Wells, made the decision on the eve of its start Monday after county officials declared a public health emergency when a case was confirmed in the area.
The tournament had previously announced Thursday that it would take various precautions in light of the virus, including having ball kids wear gloves and telling players not to handle pens or other items to autograph.
The decision came quickly and as a surprise to players, many of whom already were in Indian Wells preparing for the event. Many found out through social media Sunday evening when the tournament announced the decision. The tournament has never been canceled before.
Qualifying matches were due to begin Monday, with main draw matches beginning Wednesday.

Steve Simon, chief executive of the WTA Tour, said that officials had considered playing the tournament without spectators but rejected that option.
“We were supportive of the concept,” Simon said. “But ultimately the tournament didn’t feel it was in their best interest.”
The two-week tournament, which is a Masters 1000 tournament on the ATP Tour and one of four Premier Mandatory events for the WTA, would have concluded March 22. A smaller warmup tournament, the Oracle Challenger Series Indian Wells, concluded Sunday at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, the same stadium where the BNP Paribas Open is held.
The tournament, which has colloquially earned “Fifth Slam” recognition for its large attendance and lucrative prize money, is the largest sporting event in the United States to be canceled over the growing concerns about the spread of the epidemic. Another large international event, the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, was canceled Friday.
Organizers of Indian Wells, as the tournament is better known, said they were unwilling to take a chance on going forward. More than 450,000 fans attended the tournament in 2018 and in 2019.
“There is too great a risk, at this time, to the public health of the Riverside County area in holding a large gathering of this size,” said Dr. David Agus, a professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California, in a statement released by tournament organizers. “It is not in the public interest of fans, players and neighboring areas for this tournament to proceed. We all have to join together to protect the community from the coronavirus outbreak.”

California has reported 114 cases of the virus, including someone being treated at a hospital in Rancho Mirage in Riverside County. Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency.
There have been at least 539 cases counted in the U.S. across 34 states and the District of Columbia, with 22 deaths. Worldwide, there have been 109,400 cases and 3,800 deaths.
Tommy Haas, the Indian Wells tournament director, left open the possibility of playing his tournament at a later date in the crowded tennis calendar.
“We are very disappointed that the tournament will not take place, but the health and safety of the local community, fans, players, volunteers, sponsors, employees, vendors, and everyone involved with the event is of paramount importance,” Haas said. “We are prepared to hold the tournament on another date and will explore options.”
But finding another two-week window on the overstuffed professional tennis calendar in 2020 will be a challenge. It is unclear, however, whether other tennis events will still be staged.
The Miami Open, scheduled to begin March 23 and similar in prestige to the BNP Paribas Open, has not yet been canceled. The Ultra Music Festival, another major international cultural event scheduled for March in the Miami area, has been called off for 2020.
“The intent is still for Miami to operate,” Simon said. “It’s obviously two weeks away, but right now our approach is we are planning to operate all of our upcoming events and put every precaution in place. But we will obviously continue to work with the event very closely and will have to monitor all the situations there.”
The BNP Paribas Open is offering ticketholders refunds or credits toward tickets for the 2021 edition of the tournament.
The tennis tours shift to Europe in April for the clay season, which includes the Italian Open in Rome in May, a prestigious tournament in one of the countries most affected by the virus.
No subsequent tournaments at tour level have yet announced cancellations. Several smaller minor tournaments in China had been canceled previously, and a tournament in Bergamo, Italy, canceled its final.
Founded in 1974 and played under various names and in various locations, the BNP Paribas Open has become one of the pillars of the professional tennis tour since its move to Indian Wells in 1987. Larry Ellison, the tech tycoon and co-founder of Oracle, bought the event and the tournament complex, the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, in 2009. Since the purchase, new stadium courts and amenities have been added, and the tournament is regularly voted by the players as the best event in its category.
Although this is the first time the event has been canceled, in 1980 the tournament was not completed because of rain, and the men’s singles final was not contested.
Simon said the cancellation this year would be costly. “There will be losses for everybody,” he said. “But at this point this isn’t about the money per se. It’s about what is right, and I think it’s a challenging time right now.”

Maureen Dowd: Trump lives in a crazy fantasy world

Texto completo: Washington — The cruel insults to Joe Biden’s mental acuity are flying fast and ferocious on Fox News.
How can we trust the nuclear codes to someone so incoherent, Fox chatterers cry, who doesn’t always seem to know what day it is or what office he’s running for?
That’s no surprise. The House that Roger Ailes Built is — as Barack Obama mastermind David Plouffe boldly pointed out the other day on “Fox & Friends” — in the tank for President Donald Trump. Plouffe described the network as Trump’s “Westworld,” a fantasy realm where the president can be the man he wants to be rather than the man he is.
In “the Year of the Drunken Uncle,” as The Spectator calls it, 73-year-old Trump has belittled 77-year-old Biden as “not playing with a full deck” and predicted that, if Joe wins, his staff will “put him into a home,” and he’ll be there watching television while “superleft, radical crazies” run the White House.
At a Fox town hall Thursday night in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden’s hometown, the president made fun of Biden’s slip about “Super Thursday” and his recent observation that he was running for the Senate.
“There’s something going on there,” Trump said as his supporters laughed.
On Wednesday night, Laura Ingraham said on her program that Jill Biden “looks like she is directing a patient in the memory-care unit half the time” and showed a graphic of Biden as the dead guy propped up in “Weekend at Bernie’s.”
Republicans have made something of a specialty of challenging opponents’ cognitive capacity.
George W. Bush’s forces fought John McCain in the Republican primary by whispering that the war hero had snakes in his head from his years of torture.
Lee Atwater infamously said a Democrat running for Congress in 1980, who had received electroshock therapy in his youth for depression, had been “hooked up to jumper cables.”
Even Ronald Reagan got in on the act when he called Michael Dukakis, who was running against his vice president, “an invalid,” echoing baseless rumors spread by followers of Lyndon LaRouche that Dukakis had had psychiatric treatment.
Democrats can resort to this sort of sniping, too. Many Trump critics in 2016 and in the year after his election pushed the idea that his father had suffered from Alzheimer’s and now Trump was losing it and that his vocabulary was eroding.
And it has become common among his attackers to say the president is deranged, suffering from malignant narcissism.
In his new book, “Front Row at the Trump Show,” Jonathan Karl, chief White House correspondent for ABC News, reports the surprising fact that one of those calls on Trump derangement came from inside the White House.
Karl recounts that when Mick Mulvaney became acting chief of staff, he took senior White House staffers to Camp David for a weekend retreat. He recommended they read a 2011 book, “A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness,” by Nassir Ghaemi, director of the mood disorders program at Tufts Medical Center.
“This book argues that in at least one vitally important circumstance insanity produces good results and sanity is a problem,” Ghaemi writes in his introduction. “In times of crisis, we are better off being led by mentally ill leaders than by mentally normal ones.”
Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill had bouts with depression, and Gen. William Sherman suffered from paranoid delusions during the Civil War. But less mercurial leaders like Neville Chamberlain and Gen. George McClellan fared badly.
As Karl wrote, “The new acting chief of staff seemed to be saying President Trump was mentally ill — and that this was a good thing. The corollary to that theory: Don’t try to control the man in the Oval Office. What you think is madness is actually genius.”
In his book, Ghaemi said of people with mental disorder mania, “Decisions seem easy; no guilt, no doubt, just do it. The trouble is not in starting things, but in finishing them; with so much to do and little time, it’s easy to get distracted ... affairs are common; divorce is the norm. ... Mania is like a galloping horse. ... In Freudian terms, one might say that mania enhances the id, for better or worse.”
When Karl reached out to Ghaemi to ask how Trump would fit into his thesis, Ghaemi replied “perfectly,” noting that the president has “mild manic symptoms all the time.” Ghaemi also concedes in his book that extreme forms of mania can be highly disabling and dangerous.
Trump is continuing his Panglossian handling of the coronavirus. “The tests are beautiful!” he said as he toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday evening, after a kerfuffle over delays in testing. “The tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect, the transcription was perfect,” he added, referring to his communication with the president of Ukraine. “This is the highest-level test anywhere.”
“I like this stuff. I really get it,” he said, adding that maybe he should have become a scientist like his uncle, the “supergenius,” instead of running for president.
Meanwhile, the stock market is still freaking out, and financial angst is spreading from boardrooms to kitchen tables.
We can vividly see in this crisis how close to the surface Trump’s id is and how easily he cleaves to delusions. He personalizes everything so much that when things go bad, he can only see it as an attack on him by the forces out to get him.
He seems psychologically incapable of dealing with a virus that is complex and uncertain. The virus will be in every community and needs truth, honesty and intelligence — all absent from unstable Trump, who at his core is a frightened boy and pretender.

Texto completo: On Jan. 31, over a month ago, the Trump administration made an excellent decision: In an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus, it forbade most foreign nationals from entering the United States if they had recently traveled to China.
This move was immediately attacked in the language of cosmopolitan sophistication, which assumes that because travel bans and quarantines are associated with things liberals consider bad — nationalism, hardened borders, migration restrictions — they necessarily must not work as well.
But this supposed sophistication is really just a superstition. It’s certainly true that the travel ban could not, and did not, prevent the coronavirus from reaching the United States. But as with local quarantines and closings — all of which emphatically do work, whether you’re looking at the history of the Spanish flu or Hong Kong’s success combating the coronavirus today — you don’t need 100% effectiveness for travel restrictions to be wise and helpful. What they buy you, above all, is a slower rate of spread, and with it precious time for preparation.
So Trump made the right call, and in so doing he briefly vindicated a case that his supporters have always made for him: He acted like the guy who would make common-sensical choices in the national interest, even when they went against the nostrums of globalization and the supposed wisdom of the do-gooders.
And then his administration took the month that his decision bought the country and completely wasted it.
Obviously the White House isn’t to blame for everything that’s gone wrong with the coronavirus response. Our inability to roll out testing rapidly, even when thousands of cases are probably in circulation, owes a lot to the inherent problems of medical bureaucracy and the regulatory state and to the decadence that afflicts U.S. institutions at almost every level.
But the president can still be reasonably held responsible for the urgency with which the bureaucracy attacks the problem, the speed at which rules get suspended and workarounds enacted, the pressure brought to bear on state and local authorities to take a possible pandemic seriously and the use of presidential rhetoric to encourage private citizens to do the same.
And on all counts the White House has been failing. There should have been a public face of the anti-coronavirus effort long before Mike Pence was finally elevated with the power to respond quickly to bureaucratic bottlenecks. Weeks ago, private laboratories like Quest Diagnostics should have been encouraged to run their own tests for the virus. Weeks ago, the government should have promised to cover the cost of testing, instead of leaving it to the tangle of insurance. Weeks ago, the White House should have begun working with states and cities to devise a uniform response to outbreaks and with Congress to ready aid packages for regions that need to go into lockdown — and perhaps to prepare a general stimulus as well. Even a specific issue like the production of surgical masks, outsourced like so many things to China, could have been the focus of a Trump-directed mobilization.
Above all, the president’s rhetoric could have been deployed from early February onward to encourage people to take this disease seriously, to focus a political and social response, to prepare the country for the kind of steps that have contained the coronavirus elsewhere.
Instead, Trump fell into the same trap as the cosmopolitan sophisticates — acting as if the specter of panic is worse than the disease itself, focusing on the more reassuring estimates of the virus’s fatality rates instead of recognizing the wide spread of possible scenarios — while mixing in his own short-termist fixation on the stock market. And then when, at last, even the cosmopolitans became alarmed, he took their anxiety as a partisan insult and lapsed into “hoax” accusations, pulling a certain percentage of his co-partisans into irresponsibility along with him.
Now the time his travel ban bought us has expired, and the next few weeks will be decisive. There is still a chance that state and local efforts to contain the virus can succeed, and there are still ways in which the White House could exert strong leadership to help that happen. But right now we are headed for a scenario of rising death rates and overwhelmed hospitals, shuttered schools and empty stadiums and cancellations everywhere.
Combine this scenario’s inevitable economic consequences with the optics of the president’s blundering and solipsistic response, and the coronavirus seems very likely to doom Trump’s reelection effort, no matter where he casts the blame.
And how ironic that would be. In 2016 we elected a China hawk who promised a “complete shutdown” in response to foreign threats, a germaphobic critic of globalization who promised to privilege the national interest above all.
Now he is in danger of losing his presidency because when the great test came, in the form of a virus carried by global trade routes from communist China, he didn’t take the danger seriously enough.

Don't use coronavirus to close locker rooms to media forever

Texto completo: FORT MYERS, Fla. — The NHL, NBA, Major League Baseball and the MLS arerestricting media access to dressing rooms in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
The four professional leagues issued a joint statement Monday night, saying media access will be conducted in designated locations outside the locker rooms. The temporary changes take effective Tuesday.
The Red Sox Sunday had a meeting to discuss precautions. I think professional teams would always prefer to replace clubhouse access with formal, sterilized, boring availability.
We all want to prevent the spread of this virus. Cramming 20-30 reporters around Chris Sale's locker might not be the best idea at this time. The Colorado Avalanche posted a sign outside their locker room reminding media members: "No hand shakes. No knuckles. No hugs. No sitting at stalls.''
In this spirit, I resisted the urge to hug Alex Verdugo when I first approached him in the Red Sox clubhouse Monday morning. Similarly, J.D. Martinez and I eschewed our traditional fist bump. But let's not create a clear path to eliminate locker room access in perpetuity. Sadly, potential media-restriction policies were greeted with applause over the weekend by a couple of well-heeled sportswriters who insulted a century of hard work by beat reporters while simultaneously promoting erosion of media availability in professional sports locker rooms.
“I honestly don't think we ever need to be in a locker room," tweeted the estimable Grant Wahl, a 25-year veteran of Sports Illustrated who covers the US women's soccer team. “Doing mixed-zone postgame interviews with the USWNT outside their locker room has never been a problem."
Sopan Deb, who identifies as “NBA culture scribe" and has been with the New York Times for at least a half-hour, quickly chimed in with, "THIS IS 100 PERCENT CORRECT. It is so weird that for decades it became accepted practice for reporters to just hang out in locker room watching/waiting for athletes to get dressed.''
Both writers quickly backtracked. Wahl confessed that his tweet was “dumb," while Deb deleted his message. But that won't stop a legion of team-loving, media-hating fanboys from rushing to their keyboards to vilify journalists who fuel the 24/7 programming for our sports talk industrial complex.
Let me stop here to once again scratch my head at the number of fans who hunger for information about their favorite players/teams while routinely harpooning and mocking those who actually provide such content, a/k/a the beat reporters. It is the beat reporters who spend thousands of hours cultivating sources, panning for nuggets in big league locker rooms across America. It is not fun. It is exhausting, often demeaning, and frequently fruitless. But without that work, there would be little fuel for fans and professional bloviators.
And that work, my friends, cannot be done in overcrowded, sanitized "mixed zones,'' or Pentagonesque briefing sessions designed to promote the message of the teams without uncomfortable disclosures. Simply stated, your sports reporters need access to “the room" to develop trust, to talk to players one-on-one, to find out what is really going on. This is rarely done in the “mixed zone."
I never liked working the room, and do less of it than ever, but I did it daily for many years. It was never fun, but it is a critical part our job as “eyes and ears" of the fans.
In the late 1970s, I smoked out Orioles manager Earl Weaver after a game to ask him about pinch hitter Terry Crowley. Weaver had used Crowley as a starter that day and Crowley had three hits. I asked Earl if perhaps Crowley should be playing more regularly, and the Hall of Fame manager said, “No. He's only here because I know how to use him. If it weren't for me, Crowley would be working in a brewery."
Trust me when I tell you that Weaver would not have said that at a postgame podium.
In 1984, when the Celtics were prepping to face the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, I asked Cedric Maxwell about the prospect of guarding New York forward Bernard King, who had routinely scored 40 points in first-round games against the Pistons. Max stood up, mimicked King's runway-model walking style, and said, “No way the [expletive] is getting 40 off me!"
Not something I'd have gleaned from the "mixed zone.'' (King scored 43 in Game 4 and 44 in Game 6, but the Celtics won the series in seven.)
In a one-on-one interview in the Red Sox spring clubhouse in Winter Haven in the late 1980s, Wade Boggs displayed tire tracks on his forearm (from his wife accidentally running him over in the family Jeep the night before) and exclaimed, “I'm the white Irving Fryar!"
Oil Can Boyd told me he got drunk the night before the seventh game of the 1986 World Series because “I had no reason not to," after John McNamara scratched him from the start. It was in the Sox clubhouse at Fenway Park that Roger Clemens told me he had a manager who was too drunk to take him out of a game in which he was being routed.
It was in the Sox locker room that Josh Beckett spit on the ground at the mention of Red Sox owners trashing the deposed Terry Francona and said, “I hope Tito buries those [expletives]."
Just three years ago, I took a West Coast trip with the Red Sox and got David Price to say that he thought Dennis Eckersley was too rough when commenting on the Red Sox ("Ask anyone in this room!" said Price). On that same day in the clubhouse in Anaheim, another Sox player confirmed that teammates applauded Price when he ambushed Eckersley on a Red Sox charter from Boston to Toronto.
Those are extreme examples. Most of what is culled by reporters “hanging out in the locker room, watching/waiting for players to get dressed" is the simple day-to-day information regarding the health and prospects of athletes hired to win games and entertain fans. It is tedious, time-sucking work. It's also totally necessary if fans desire to be informed about the teams they love.
These are scary times. It's vital to protect mankind and limit the spread of this virus. Sox players have been told to stop high-fiving and spitting on the dugout floor. A temporary change in clubhouse access rules might be necessary to stop the spread of coronavirus. But here's hoping this doesn't become a permanent thing. Fans hungry for information about their teams would do well to understand what is lost when you take sports reporters out of the locker room.

Black women voters -- the Democrats' 'political booster cables' -- have helped fuel Joe Biden's resurgence

Texto completo: CHARLOTTE, N.C. — As voters across the country finished casting their ballots last Tuesday night, a group of supporters of former vice president Joe Biden gathered here in a wood-paneled cidery to watch the results.
The evening gathering was mostly Black women over the age of 40, who clinked glasses and cheered loudly as they watched his Super Tuesday victories roll in. In many ways, they had themselves to thank.
In North Carolina and states across the country, Black women like them helped deliver the wins for Biden last week . And with Democratic nomination contests in six more states Tuesday, including three with significant Black populations, Biden again will turn to this important constituency as he battles with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
“People outside are beginning to say, 'Look, it's the black women,"' said Representative Alma Adams, whose district includes Charlotte.
Black voters in Southern states voted overwhelmingly for Biden on Super Tuesday, according to CNN exit polls. Among Black voters, the majority tend to be women. In the 2018 congressional midterms, 55 percent of Black women voted compared to 47 percent of Black men, according to US Census data.
“If not before, definitely now, people understand that they serve as the political booster cables for the Democratic Party," Antjuan Seawright, a political consultant from South Carolina, said of Black women.
Seawright worked on the 2017 Senate race in Alabama, where Black women played a key role in electing Doug Jones, the first Democratic senator from the state in 25 years. Black women then went on to propel Democratic wins in gubernatorial races in Kentucky and Louisiana, as well as in state legislative races in Virginia this year.
Looking into the future, he said, Black women are the secret to helping engage, and reengage, Black men.
“Every African-American male belongs to or has some connection to a strong Black woman," Seawright said.
On Tuesday, voters head to the polls in Michigan, Missouri, and Mississippi, where Black voters form an important part of the Democratic electorate. Biden acknowledged that on Monday night, scheduling a campaign event in Detroit featuring two former rivals and Black leaders who have recently endorsed him, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California.
Sanders has countered with an endorsement from veteran civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who won the Michigan caucuses in his 1988 presidential campaign.
Data for years have shown America's demographics shifting toward a majority-minority country. As the nation changes, once-marginalized groups of young people have looked to Black women as the original model for how an often overlooked group has made its voice heard.
“We are the matriarchs, so to speak, and you know, we just kind of grew up that way, we had role models," Adams said, citing her mother who earned money doing domestic work and did not have an education but pushed her to attend college.
Adams arrived at the Biden watch party just as his North Carolina victory was announced. Biden won 62 percent of the Black vote in the state, according to CNN exit polls. His wins last week were propelled in large part by his victory in South Carolina three days before, when 61 percent of Black voters chose Biden, reviving his campaign.
Adams said the experience of living in the Jim Crow South taught Black women that the ballot box was their most effective tool to help their communities. Now they are again turning there to try to avoid four more years of President Trump, whom many of them see as the most dangerous threat in their lifetime to all the progress they have made.
“We cannot afford not to vote so that we can turn this around," Adams said.
On the back of a campaign flier, Jacqueline Barksdale kept a tally of states Biden won as she sat at a long table in the center of the cidery last Tuesday night. The 53-year-old had tried unsuccessfully to persuade her husband to come to the watch party. Instead, she found company in two other women whose partners also preferred to stay home. As the returns came in, they cheered with their new friends.
“People are seeing the importance of the African-American vote and the importance of African-American women voting and how we always go to the polls," Barksdale said.
Beside her, Ava Blount said the needs of Black women are not much different from those of any other demographic group, but as the heads of their households, they have extra motivation to make their opinions count.
“It's us who stand our families up," said Blount, 57.
The women said they support Biden because they want someone in the White House who reflects the values they teach their children. “We want someone who is caring, like a woman, who is loving and decent," Blount said.
Cathy Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who studies race and politics, said focusing on the voter turnout of Black women unfairly narrows their involvement with politics and society more broadly. It also narrows the spectrum of their political views to cast all Black women as in lock-step with moderate policies of a candidate like Biden.
“Black women are smart political actors and what we are experiencing now is a type of political pragmatism," Cohen said of their support for him.
But just as in other demographic groups, the 2020 election has shown a generational divide among Black women. Ask the middle-aged women at the Biden watch party about Bernie Sanders, the progressive Vermont senator running against Biden, and they get angry.
“He's appealing to that group of people who is easily influenced, who is simply not going to do their homework," Blount said. Young people are now looking for a “wing and a prayer" but it is parents' duty to raise children who can see through politicians' false promises, Barksdale said.
In Charlotte, this generational divide played out in stark contrast this year. Vi Lyles, the city's first Black female mayor, endorsed Mike Bloomberg for president.
Lyles' daughter, Aisha Alexander, is a progressive organizer in Washington and an outspoken critic of some of her mother's political decisions, including the endorsement. Alexander supported Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who espoused many of the progressive platforms of Sanders in what Alexander called a more practical format.
For Alexander, 36, the shifting views of young Black people are not developed in spite of the views of the older generation, but because of them.
“There is certainly a generation of folks who have come to know this idea of compromise as a means of survival, and as a means of getting a seat at a table, and I don't downplay that at all, because if they didn't do that, then I wouldn't be able to flip the table over," Alexander said.
At some point , though , it will be time for this new generation of Black women to become the leaders and help take the Democratic Party to a new place, Alexander said.
Younger Black women are now pushing the Democratic Party to do more of the community organizing and groundwork they learned from their mothers and grandmothers, she said.
“Whereas Black women have been a solid base, Black women need to become the face of the party," she said. “And if that doesn't happen ... then you're going to lose us, and if you lose us, you lose this country."

Texto completo: WNBA star Maya Moore put her professional basketball career on hold to help pursue the freedom of a Missouri inmate that she believed had been wrongly convicted.
On Monday, Moore helped Jonathan Irons, 39, have his initial conviction overturned, according to ESPN, after he served 22 years of a 50-year sentence, following a conviction of burglary and assault against a homeowner with a gun.
"This day has been a long time coming," Moore said after the hearing, according to ESPN. com. "We are just so grateful and thankful to God and to everybody who has played a role in bringing justice. "
Moore had removed herself from consideration for the 2020 U. S. Olympic team in January in order to focus on helping Irons earn his freedom. Moore announced then that she would be skipping her second consecutive professional season, after she had previously led the Minnesota Lynx to four WNBA championships.
Moore had met Irons in 2017, when she toured the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Since then, she helped pay the defense team and has attended several of Irons’ courtroom hearings to offer her support.
According to ESPN, the homeowner testified that Irons was the person who assaulted him, but Irons’ lawyers argued that there was no evidence to corroborate those allegations. Irons is African-American and was 16 at the time, but was tried as an adult and found guilty by the all-white jury.
Judge Daniel Green granted Irons’ petition for a write of habeas corpus, vacating his conviction, according to the report. Judge Green placed a stay on the order, which allows Missouri 15 days to request a review by the appellate court. If the state does not appeal, then St. Charles County has 30 days to decide if it wants to retry Irons.
"It's a very good day," Irons' attorney Kent Gipson said, according to ESPN. "But it's not quite over yet. "
Moore had family and friends by her side during the hearing, ESPN reported, and spoke to Irons on the phone after the hearing was over.
“Basketball has not been foremost in my mind," Moore told the New York Times in January in an exclusive interview. "I’ve been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road. And I’ve been able to be there for Jonathan. ”

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors charged 27 racehorse trainers, veterinarians and drug distributors on Monday in a series of indictments for doping horses, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York announced.
Jason Servis, the trainer of Maximum Security, was among those charged. The indictment claims that Servis provided performance-enhancing drugs to "virtually all" of his horses from February 2018 to February 2020, which included more than 1,000 races.
The New York Times was the first to report the news.
Maximum Security drew attention in last May's Kentucky Derby when the horse crossed the finish line first but was disqualified for knocking into another horse and impeding its momentum.
According to four separate indictments, the scheme was based on the manufacturing and distribution of adulterated and misbranded drugs that secretly were provided to racehorses "all to the detriment and risk of the health and well-being of the racehorses. "
The defendants defrauded and misled regulators "and the betting public," according to the indictment.
The scheme, according to the indictment files, covered races in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio and Kentucky, and also stretched to the United Arab Emirates.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Under a new policy that took effect last week, Twitter labeled a video of former Vice President Joe Biden "manipulated media," marking the first time it had applied the advisory label.
Facebook, on the other hand, declined to do anything about the video, drawing an angry response from the Biden campaign.
In the 13-second video clip, which was shared by White House Media Director Dan Scavino in a tweet that was retweeted by President Donald Trump, Biden is shown fumbling for his words during a campaign rally in Kansas City on Saturday while denouncing negative campaigning in the Democratic primary race.
"Turn this primary from a campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for, because we cannot reelect, we cannot win this reelection. Excuse me, we can only reelect Donald Trump," he says before the clip cuts off.
But the clip does not contain the full sentence.
"We can only reelect Donald Trump if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It's got to be a positive campaign, so join us," Biden says in his full remarks.
Trump retweeted two posts featuring the clip. One from Scavino, which read "We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump," and the other from Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.
"I finally agree with Joe Biden on something! He’s exactly right – If we don’t want 4 years of this, we can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump. RT!" read Kirk's post.
Election 2020: Twitter says deceptively doctored videos and photos may get labeled or removed
A Twitter moment under the heading "Video of Joe Biden endorsing Trump is edited" said a "video circulated that appeared to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden calling to re-elect Trump. "
"Journalists from The New York Times, CNN and Politico pointed out that the clip is edited in a misleading way," the moment said.
Twitter's "synthetic and manipulated media policy" took effect on March 5. It forbids "synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm" and says it may "label Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context. "
In the criteria for determining whether something is "deceptively altered or fabricated," Twitter says "subtler forms" can include "isolative editing, omission of context or presentation with false context. " Twitter said the response to those types of deception will be determined on a "case-by-case basis. "
More "significant forms of alteration" include "wholly synthetic audio or video" – often referred to as "deepfakes" – or content that has been doctored (spliced and reordered, slowed down) to change its meaning. "
The label was not visible on the retweets of the video that appeared in Trump's Twitter timeline as of Monday, however.
Twitter told USA TODAY that the label is not "currently showing up in Tweet detail due to a technical error, but is visible in the timeline. We're working on a fix. "
A video shared by the social media platform outlines how the "manipulated media" label is supposed to work.
Scavino pushed back on Twitter's decision to label the video.
"The video was NOT manipulated," he said in a tweet.
"#SleepyJoe is such a mess that @Twitter thinks this video was manipulated. Sorry! He actually said this. Not manipulated. They are trying to drag Joe across the finish line," tweeted Gary Cody, the Trump campaign's digital director.
Fake Trump video? How to spot deepfakes on Facebook and YouTube ahead of the presidential election
Facebook, which also has adopted a policy aimed at addressing manipulated media, initially left the video untouched. That company's policy says it "does not extend to content that is parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words. "
Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz blasted Facebook for the policy, which he said ignores its responsibility to address disinformation.
"Facebook's malfeasance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false information is a national crisis in this respect," Schultz said in a statement.
"Facebook won't say it, but it is apparent to all who have examined their conduct and policies: they care first and foremost about money and, to that end, are willing to serve as one of the world's most effective mediums for the spread of vile lies," he said. "Their unethical behavior is not acceptable, and it must change. "
After a fact-check, Facebook labeled the video "partly false. " A company spokeswoman told CNN that Facebook would also reduce the video's distribution and show "warning labels with more context for people who see it, try to share it, or already have. "
Disinformation on social media has been a growing concern since the 2016 election. Former special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russian intelligence operatives conducted "a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States" ahead of that election.
"The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U. S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton," Mueller found.
And experts have repeatedly warned that Russia and other actors will use social media to interfere in the 2020 election.
Tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter have struggled to find responses to the disinformation that balance the concerns for the public good, their users' concerns and their companies' profit margins.
And their task has become more difficult as the quality of deceptive video has improved.
Deceptively edited videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appearing to slur her words and of Biden appearing to make racist remarks were widely shared on social media, prompting outcries from Democrats demanding action to combat the spread of such content.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Pete Buttigieg has a new gig. At least for one night.
The former presidential candidate will be guest-hosting "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on Thursday, he announced Monday.
Guests will include Patrick Stewart.
“Very excited about that,” Buttigieg said on NBC’s “Today Show. ”
Buttigieg suspended his presidential campaign on March 1 and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden the next day.
Buttigieg said he is traveling the country, thanking supporters, before getting some time away with his husband, Chasten.
“Then we’ll come back and I’ll make myself useful in new ways,” he said on NBC. “But we’re going to have some fun first. ”
The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, got a standing ovation when he and Chasten attended a performance of “The Inheritance” in New York City on Sunday.
Buttigieg isn’t the only former presidential candidate enjoying himself since leaving the race.
Three days after ending her campaign last week, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was on "Saturday Night Live," appearing with Kate McKinnon, the cast member who portrayed her.

Buttigieg, who regularly tussled with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at the Democratic debates, was asked if she would be one of his guests on “Jimmy Kimmel Live. ”
“I’m hoping to catch up with her soon,” he responded.
Klobuchar recently told The New York Times that she wrote Buttigieg “a nice note” after a withdrew from the race and they talked the next day.
Besides doing what he can to help Biden get elected, Buttigieg has said he will get involved in down-ballot races. He told supporters last week that there are a lot of diverse leaders from a new generation whose contests will decide what the next president will be able to achieve and what will happen in state governments
While it was painful to have to decide to withdraw, Buttigieg said there are benefits to no longer being hyperfocused on one thing.
“It’s nice," he said, "to be able to zoom out and just come back at life. "
Opinoin: Goodbye for now, Mayor Pete. But this is not farewell.

John Bolton should be able to tell truth before lawmakers

Texto completo: John Bolton might know the truth, but he'll have to answer for his silence to Congress.
One would think that given Mr. Bolton's humble upbringing as a Baltimore native from a working class neighborhood, he'd feel empathy for those who oppose a president hostile to his own city. As a teenager, Mr. Bolton received a merit scholarship to the prestigious McDonogh School, a Baltimore County institution famous for its academic rigor and emphasis on integrity. The school's honor code reads as follows:
"I will not lie, cheat, or steal. I will respect the rights and well-being of myself and others."
Had Mr. Trump's former national security adviser testified in front of the House when initially called, instead of keeping silent, waiting for a didn't-happen Republican Senate subpoena, and banking on a multi-million dollar book deal, then perhaps he could have lived up to the latter half of this honor code.
An excerpt from Mr. Bolton's upcoming book was leaked in the New York Times. Reportedly, there are at least a dozen pages on Mr. Trump's Ukraine involvement. Mr. Bolton's book claims in its title that he was "In the Room Where it Happened." More leaks are expected to come. The reported book text confirms that there was indeed a "quid pro quo" by Mr. Trump, which Mr. Bolton witnessed, of Ukrainian aid in exchange for Mr. Biden investigation announcements.
It wouldn't be unreasonable to think that, given his Baltimore roots, Mr. Bolton would have compassion for those at the mercy of dishonest and powerful special interests.
His father was a firefighter, who by his life taught selflessness.
It is inexplicable that Mr. Bolton, a self described "Americanist " (as he defined it, someone who puts America first), was willing to talk with The Senate instead of testifying in front of The House Intelligence Committee and complying with his subpoena.
It comes off as pure partisanship, and should be known as such. Partisanship should never be a deciding factor when testimony vital to the preservation of American democracy hangs in the balance. We live under a government, including the House and Senate, elected by people; regardless of which side wins each.
Mr. Bolton had and still has the chance to testify before the House. He can come clean and take a moral stance against abuse of power and the corruption of the presidency.
He has a chance to provide a fair warning that if the details of President Trump's actions are not exposed, he will likely once again attempt to interfere with the 2020 elections and make demands for anything else he wants.
But Mr. Bolton waited until after the House impeachment inquiry's conclusion to announce that he was willing to testify during the Senate trial - something which, the political sophisticate that he is, he knew was not likely to happen. He wants us to glean it all in his new book, yet the White House is now fighting its distribution on "national security" and "classification" grounds - which all too often means simply to protect the subject of exposure from political embarrassment for wrongdoing. The book was supposed to be released this month but pushed back because of the continued "review" by the White House.
Ultimately, Mr. Bolton has free speech and, unlike Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, does not have a job now from which he can be fired. Mr. Bolton can do the right thing.
Mr. Bolton's book is now set to be released in May.
That is, if the White House does not manage to block its release entirely. That is another few month with no answers, and another few months without a sworn testimony that Mr. Bolton owes his country.
The written pages are not the amplification in questions and answers under oath that define the truth.
Mr. Bolton should be thanked for deciding to say something about the corruption going on in this country, but he is no patriot. Seventeen patriotic witnesses, including the recently fired Lt. Col. Vindman, defied Mr. Trump and White House counsel's edict not to testify - a book without testimony is naked opportunism.
Another Baltimore native, the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, said it best: "When we're dancing with the angels, the question will be asked, What did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?"
There is no question that Mr. Bolton testifying and doing the right thing to protect and uphold his nation's democracy would make his community and his country proud.
Baltimore's John Bolton still has the chance to do the right thing by testifying, and it should not matter which party happens to control the House or Senate.

Texto completo: RED BANK – When it came time for his closing argument last summer, Christopher Placitella told the jury that he woke up in the middle of the night thinking about pain.
It wasn't just physical pain that his client, D'Angela McNeill-George, endured, he said, but also the emotional pain of missing out on the simple, joyful moments in life: birthday parties, walks on the beach, her son's football games.
"That's enjoyment of life," he said, showing photos of McNeill-George before she was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer that he argued was caused by talc in Johnson & Johnson's baby powder.
Placitella won the case that was noteworthy not only for the penalties — $37.2 million in compensatory damages and $750 million in punitive damages — but also for putting J&J CEO Alex Gorsky on the stand for the first time in a baby powder case.
The punitive award was quickly reduced by the judge to about $185 million based on state laws. But the case marked a milestone for Placitella, who has spent his career taking on deep-pocketed corporations and government agencies that he says have gone astray and hurt consumers.
His position hasn't always made him popular; product liability lawyers long have been associated with not-for-prime-time television commercials soliciting the sick and injured for personal gain.
But those who know Placitella say he is a true believer. He has tapped into a deep well of empathy to take leading roles in high-profile cases that include asbestos, tobacco, silicone implants, pain medicine and lead. The plight of his clients strikes him deeply.
"You can't do that and represent the people he has without having a deep-seated emotional connection with the people, as well as what they've gone through," said Moshe Maimon, a New York lawyer who, along with Chris Panatier, worked on the J&J case with Placitella.
Placitella, 63, is a partner with Cohen, Placitella and Roth, which has offices here and in Philadelphia.
He lives in Little Silver with his wife, Rachel, a former Monmouth County assistant prosecutor who works with him at the firm. They have three adult children: Jared, also a lawyer there; Justin; and Jennarose.
In the case against J&J, Placitella represented McNeill-George, 41, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who was referred to him after she was diagnosed in July 2016 with mesothelioma, a type of cancer that develops on the linings of internal organs.
He filed a lawsuit in Middlesex County, home of New Brunswick-based J&J, alleging her disease was caused by exposure to asbestos in talc that she used from the 1970s to the 1990s.
McNeill-George joined three other sets of plaintiffs in the case, and she said it was a stressful time. She traveled back and forth for the trial, all while coping with pain and raising her 8-year-old son. And she took the stand to discuss a time in her life that she said was not happy.
Working with Placitella "has been wonderful, honestly," she said recently. "He works real hard at what he (does) and, you know, he's not always a serious person. He's funny. He keeps you laughing, trying to keep a smile on my face. But at the end, he's like a shark."
The case spotlighting the safety of Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, one of its best-known products, began last summer and quickly turned contentious.
On the second day of the trial, Placitella said, he and his team returned to the Heldrich hotel in New Brunswick where they were staying, only to be locked out of their rooms.
When they asked a hotel manager about it, Placitella said, they were told J&J exercised its right to prevent them from staying there. The hotel eventually relented, he said.
"It's commonplace for opposing legal teams to stay at separate hotels as they prepare for an upcoming trial," a J&J spokesperson said in response. "The suggestion that Johnson & Johnson or any of its lawyers locked anyone out of a hotel is false."
The trial itself included fireworks. In the first phase, Judge Ana Viscomi struck down the entire closing argument from J&J's lawyer Diane Sullivan, admonishing her for accusing the plaintiffs' attorneys of creating evidence, according to a transcript.
The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering J&J to pay $37.2 million, including $14.7 million to McNeill-George.
In the second phase, J&J CEO Gorsky testified for the first time, shedding light on how the company tried to contain the fallout from reports in Reuters and The New York Times that alleged it knew for decades that its baby powder contained asbestos.
The jury came back with punitive damages of $750 million, which was reduced by Viscomi to $185 million; state law caps punitive damages at five times compensatory damages.
J&J noted that juries in the previous four talc trials found in the company's favor, and it plans to appeal.
"We sympathize with all who are suffering from cancer, and we understand patients and their families are seeking answers," a spokesperson said. "Consumers can be assured that more than 40 years of independent scientific evaluations confirm that Johnson's Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer."
For Placitella, the trial was something of a homecoming. He grew up in Woodbridge, Middlesex County. His father was a chemist; his mother, a real estate agent.
They wanted him to be a dentist, but he set his sights on being a lawyer.
"It's going to sound corny, but I always thought that was a route to be able to, you know, change things in society," he said.
Placitella went to Fordham University in New York City and then Syracuse University College of Law before returning to New Jersey to work at the Woodbridge law firm founded by David Wilentz, the famed former New Jersey attorney general.
He promptly worked on an asbestos case — and lost. Searching for answers, he decided the jury must not have liked his mustache, he said, so he shaved.
But he also picked up mentors, including Ronald Motley, a South Carolina lawyer who made his name taking on the tobacco industry.
Placitella's career rebounded, putting him at the forefront of some of New Jersey's highest-profile liability cases.
In 1998 he helped represent the state in its lawsuit against the tobacco industry, negotiating a settlement for $7.6 billion.
The next year, he represented consumers in a class action case against American Home Products, now Wyeth, which made the diet drug fen-phen, negotiating a settlement for as much as $4.8 billion.
He represented hundreds of consumers in lawsuits in the mid-2000's against Merck, arguing its blockbuster painkiller Vioxx had a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Merck won several of those cases, but eventually agreed to pay $4.9 billion as part of a settlement.
"He's very slow, calm, but very sure of himself," said Dan Myer, a founder the Princeton-based litigation support company Verus, who has known Placitella for 25 years. "There's no better lawyer out there than he is."
Placitella left Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer in 2004 and joined Stewart Cohen and Harry Roth in a new firm, giving him a chance to work together with his wife.
The Placitellas set up shop in a refurbished Victorian home in Red Bank, choosing the borough because they saw it as a diverse and accepting community, he said.
Nowadays, they are joined by their son, Jared, who works in the Philadelphia office, and their golden retriever, Sandy, who lounges in the Red Bank office.
Placitella is preparing for J&J's appeal in state court, and he is representing more clients in a federal lawsuit in Trenton, where upwards of 16,000 consumers say the company's baby powder caused not mesothelioma, but ovarian cancer.
Placitella sat in a conference room and recounted the recent trial, recreating his closing argument and noting that one of the plaintiffs in the case, Will Ronning, of Savannah, Georgia, died before it ended at the age of 48.
For Placitella, heartbreak comes with the territory.
"I get discouraged for a day, but I keep a global perspective," Placitella said. "I always tell everybody I haven't worked a day in my life since I got out of law school."
"People accuse me of being a true believer," he said.
"But I really think we can make a difference in the world, and we have, I think."

Texto completo: FREMONT - A former News-Messenger correspondent was recently contacted by an independent movie producer who has done extensive work with Netflix about turning her book, "Struggling with Serendipity," into a movie. Cindy Kolbe's book explores the fear, acceptance, and success that flourished in the years following a tragic car accident. Kolbe, who now lives in West Virginia, discussed her book and the movie option at a March 2 Author Talk and Signing at Birchard Public Library.
For Kolbe, a movie will be one more opportunity to share her story of hope.
Hope seemed an impossible concept the night Kolbe fell asleep while driving to her rural Tiffin home nearly 20 years ago. The car flipped, and her 14-year-old daughter Beth was instantly paralyzed from the chest down. In that brief moment, their lives changed, but Beth's heart and character did not. Her first reaction to the news of her paralysis would become the foundation of her family's world from that moment on; she told her father, John, "Let's talk about what I can do."
After months of rehab at the former St. Francis Health Care Centre in Green Springs, Beth gained remarkable personal and professional success. She set 14 records as a swimmer on the U.S. Paralympic National Team, and she was the first member with a visible disability on the varsity Harvard Women's Swimming and Diving Team.
Today, Beth is a health policy lawyer in Washington, D.C. Her May 18, 2019, wedding to Dan Hardcastle was featured in "The New York Times" and "Washingtonian" Magazine.
Beth's success in life came from her own dogged determination which blossomed under her mother's care. After the accident, Cindy pushed through the despondency which flooded into her life and focused on being physically and emotionally present for her daughter. Today, as Beth lives happily independent in Washington, Cindy travels the country sharing her story with others who need a word of hope in the wake of trauma.
"I've seen the process evolve from the first book event to 22,000 Twitter followers and Cindy mentoring with the Christopher Reeve foundation," John said.
Cindy speaks at Abilities Expo events across the country, teaches writing workshops, and gives a listening ear to fans at book events who are grateful for the chance to talk to someone who understands their pain. John often travels with Cindy on the book tour, and he has discovered that everyone has a story to tell and Cindy gives them a compassionate opportunity.
"And I love that," Cindy said. "We've all had life-changing moments, and we become different people. If we're lucky, we become better people along the way."
Cindy further helps people tell their story through writing workshops across the country. She will teach a "Sharing Your Story" workshop at Tiffin Seneca Public Library on June 2. She and John will host an Author Talk and Signing at Keystone-LaGrange Public Library in Lagrange on June 3 and at Ritter Public Library in Vermilion on June 4.

8 ways to save for your summer vacation

Texto completo: Have you started planning your summer vacation yet? It'll be sipping-lemonade-by-the-pool season before you know it. I love vacations, but here's what I don't love: Nearly 40 percent of millennials are willing to go into debt for their trips.
Coming back home to credit card bills makes the end of a vacation miserable. I don't want that to be your story. If you start saving up now, you'll be in great shape when it's time to pack your bags.
Here are eight ways to save up and pay for your vacation with your own money:
1. Give your budget a refresh. If it's been a while since you looked at where your money is really going each month, I bet you'll find some areas where you can cut back in a matter of minutes. Then, you can put that cash toward your vacation fund.
2. Brew your own coffee at home. I get it. Fancy coffee with a designer label makes me feel special, too. But if you put that $25 a week into a vacation fund for a while, you'll add a couple hundred bucks or more to your travel budget.
3. Pack your lunch. Peanut butter and jelly today means piña coladas all day on the beach this summer.
4. Order water at restaurants. If you go out to eat, give up extras like soda, appetizers, and alcohol.
5. Save on groceries by shopping generic or at Aldi. Everyone I know swears their grocery bill was slashed in half simply by switching to shopping at Aldi. If you don't have one near you, you can save money buying store brand or generic brand items.
6. Sell your kids' clothes at consignment stores. I'm a huge fan of this! I also love shopping consignment to save money.
7. Sell stuff online through places like Facebook Marketplace. You know there's stuff lying around the house, in the garage, or in your closet that you don't use anymore. Put it to good use by selling it, and put that money toward your vacation!
8. Cancel any unused subscriptions. When's the last time you really watched a show on HBO, or used any of the makeup samples from your Birchbox? I'm not hating on subscription services, but if you don't use them, that's money leaving your bank account each month you could be saving.
Once you try these money-saving tips, you might just make them a habit. Then, you'll be ahead of the game when it's vacation time next year. My free Vacation Budget Worksheet makes it super easy to plan for all your expenses.
Things always cost more than you expect. But this worksheet will help you plan for everything — even the unexpected stuff.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - In the spring of 1983, even before the virus that causes AIDS had a name, a young Army doctor named Deborah Birx suffered excessive bleeding while giving birth. Moments before she passed out from pain, she screamed an order at her husband: "Do not let them give me blood!"
She may have saved her own life. The blood she would have received was later discovered to be contaminated with HIV.
"That was Debbie's first brush with AIDS, and it literally changed her," John Kerry, then the secretary of state, said in 2014, after President Barack Obama put Birx in charge of addressing the global AIDS epidemic. "It made her think hard not just about the perils of this new disease but about her responsibility to fight it."
Now, after researching HIV and devising public health strategies to combat it for more than three decades, Birx has a new virus to fight.
As President Donald Trump's newly named White House coronavirus response coordinator, she has the difficult task of tracking and orchestrating the government's effort to contain the outbreak, while projecting a calm, authoritative presence to counter the mixed messages from Trump.
Vice President Mike Pence, who is overseeing the government's response, introduced her as "my right arm." Public health experts said her task is immense.
"There are lots of things that can go wrong here," said Dr. Thomas Frieden, who worked with Birx when he ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and she oversaw the CDC's division of global AIDS. "It's possible that we'll look back in six months and say, 'It's not so bad; we overreacted.' We just don't know. But we wouldn't want to look back in six months and say we underreacted."
Unlike Dr. Anthony Fauci, another member of the coronavirus task force and the oft-quoted director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Birx - who carried the rank of ambassador at the State Department - is stepping gingerly into the public eye. She has taken pains not to contradict the president, praising the White House for its "energy and efficiency."
That kind of political savvy helps explain why Birx is one of only a handful of Obama political appointees who is still working for the Trump administration.
"Thank God she's in charge," said Katy Talento, a former health policy adviser to Trump.
Tough and disciplined - she walks several miles to work each day to "clear her head," one associate said - Birx is most often described as "data driven." She is running what amounts to a coronavirus war room from the vice president's office, meeting with government and public health officials and pharmaceutical industry executives to shore up beleaguered local health departments, scale up the production of coronavirus test kits and encourage research into antiviral medicines and vaccines.
"I think this administration is realizing that her credibility and the years of sweat equity and trust she has built up working with people on both sides of the aisle is arguably her best asset," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
For the past six years at the State Department, Birx has, among her responsibilities, overseen the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, created in 2003 by President George W. Bush when antiretroviral drugs saving lives in developed countries were not available in other nations.
In its first decade, the initiative focused on "priority countries," offering broad public health programs to slow the spread of HIV, said Dr. Paul Zeitz, who worked for Birx for three years.
Birx, he said, concluded that it would be more effective to concentrate specifically on HIV prevention and the treatment of infected people in areas where the epidemic was disseminating swiftly. She made difficult decisions to take money from "low-transmission zones" and beef up spending in areas where the disease was spreading rapidly, using statistics as a guide.
"I saw her be very tough with country teams," Zeitz said. "She wanted the facts about exactly what was happening with their epidemic, and if people did not have data in a way that it could be used, where it could be disaggregated by gender, by geography - and then she got all the way down to statistics for each medical clinic - they would have to go back to the drawing board."
Birx also created a program known as DREAMS, a public-private partnership to reduce rates of HIV among adolescent girls and young women. That demographic accounts for 74% of new HIV infections among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is most prevalent.

High voter turnout is bad for Trump

Texto completo: The best news for Democrats in the Super Tuesday results may not be the surge of Joe Biden, or Bernie Sanders hanging on, or even Mike Bloomberg dropping out. No, the best news is the record and near record turnout of Democratic voters all across the country.
Whoever the eventual nominee is, it's clear that Democrats are fired up and ready to vote to defeat Donald Trump.
In Virginia, turnout was the highest on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2008. In fact, 23% of registered Virginians cast ballots on Super Tuesday, which almost doubled primary turnout from 2016.
Utah saw a turnout in Tuesday's Democratic primary that eclipsed previous turnout for any primary held in the state, among Democrats or Republicans. In North Carolina, voter turnout was also up over 2016 numbers. And early voting had a strong surge — with almost twice as many Democrats in the state casting early ballots compared with Republicans.
Numbers are still being crunched, but U.S. News and World Report detailed high turnout across the country. Early evidence suggests that Texas saw an increase of nearly a half-million primary ballots cast over 2016 numbers. In Maine, turnout was so high that many polling stations ran out of Democratic primary ballots. Plus, according to the Human Rights Campaign, LGBTQ voters doubled their representation in Super Tuesday turnout.
Other outcomes are still being analyzed, but The New York Times has reported on how Latino voters are expected to provide a decisive surge in California, Texas and beyond.
In other words, if you're looking for your silver lining, Democrats, I got it right here. In a crazy, crowded primary election in which the only thing Democrats consistently seem able to agree on is that they want to defeat Trump, in the primary elections Democrats are indeed enthusiastically showing up.
There are and have been some amazing Democratic candidates in this election, but no single candidate has yet galvanized a strong and enduring majority of support.
That could change any day, but it's notable to see record turnout when there's not excitement around some single candidate driving that turnout — as we saw, for instance, with Barack Obama in 2008. You've got Democrats turning up in record numbers in Utah to nominate Sanders and Democrats turning up in record numbers in South Carolina to nominate Biden.
The through line doesn't appear to be any one candidate but, rather, Democratic enthusiasm and energy.
We're just chomping at the bit to vote for anyone but Trump.
To be clear, there are some clouds in this silver lining. Young voters aren't turning out at the levels that helped put Obama in the White House and that would certainly help put Democrats over the top this fall. In Texas, for instance, NBC News' exit polls show that the share of Democratic primary voters over the age of 65 was almost twice as high as in 2008, and still overrepresented compared with the state's growing younger population.
There are also concerns about suppression. Part of the record lines reported at polling stations have had to do with record turnout, but they also stemmed from Republicans shuttering polling locations and imposing new ID requirements.
When CNN's Ed Lavandera tweeted about a man at Texas Southern University who spent nearly seven hours waiting to vote, commentator and advocate Keith Boykin noted, "Texas has closed 750 polling places since 2012, many in black and brown communities, causing long lines."
What is clear is that Trump and Republicans don't want an election that includes every voter and treats them equally, just like they don't want our nation to include all of us and treat all of us equally.
Although it is not yet clear who Democrats will nominate as our standard-bearer in this existential, epoch-defining electoral battle in November, it is increasingly clear that Democrats are fired up for that fight — and in spite of all the obstacles, going to damn well make sure our voices are heard.
While we don't yet know who is the ultimate winner of this raucous, energetic Democratic primary, Trump is the ultimate loser.

In a husband, Mandy Moore finds ultimate 'collaborator'

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album. In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams. In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.

Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.

Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: UNCASVILLE - One forced turnover or shot clock violation after another, the UConn women's basketball team quickly choked the life out of South Florida on Sunday afternoon, and all of Geno Auriemma's newfound positive vibes could be felt swirling around the backstage areas of Mohegan Sun Arena.
That's where all the good stuff usually comes out, in those makeshift hallways, along the black curtains, off to the side after the latest American Athletic Conference victory - now 138 in a row, never a loss.
UConn smoked the Bulls 79-38 in an AAC Tournament semifinal and moved into the championship game, the program's final one, Monday night against Cincinnati.
Those are the day's details, but let's be real. The sights and sounds of this week are always more important than any of these two-hour foregone conclusions and the numbers that actually string the victories together.
UConn is a much tougher and smarter version of itself these days, committed to defense, detailed on offense.
That bodes well for a coach who has spent months trying to teach and figure out a unique group of players. It doesn't bode well for the happy national narrative about the Huskies being so down and out that they'll be put down in an NCAA regional and left out of the Final Four for the first time since 2007.
"We know what our standing is in the basketball community," Auriemma said. "We've won so many games over the years, we've won so many championships, that the rest of women's basketball is in a state of euphoria that UConn might not be in the Final Four and somebody else will get a chance to play and blah, blah, blah, blah.
"I get all that. And that's fine. There's nothing we can do about that. But until we're out, we're not out. Until somebody knocks us out, we're still in."
Auriemma was on, what, his fourth postgame interview at that point?
Doesn't matter. The point is he hung around for what seemed like forever because there was a lot to talk about, as there typically is in March, and most of it worth feeling really good about.
This much is becoming clear: If UConn goes down in the NCAA Tournament, even before the Final Four, it will probably go down while playing well. That didn't always appear to be the case as Auriemma's coaching messages for this team were once careening aimlessly throughout Gampel Pavilion.
But the Huskies have gained traction now, his team has turned a corner at the most critical time, and Auriemma actually had a little twinkle in his eye and a grin on his face. Who knows what the coming weeks hold, but anyone watching has to feel good about the way UConn will actually represent itself.
On Sunday, one could forget for a moment what a trying year it has been, on and off the court in a variety of ways. Here is UConn (28-3), with some momentum, arriving at March to show - not wonder - what it is made of, with Auriemma engaged in the usual conversations long, long, long after a tournament game.
"And as long as we're in, we've got a shot," Auriemma said. "And whichever [NCAA] bracket we end up in, if somebody's celebrating that we're there, and we're not what we used to be, they've still got to knock us out. Now, we don't punch as hard as we used to, we don't quite move as well as we used to, but we're still a tough out."
The national media tends to parachute into Mohegan for this event, taking the March temperature of the sport's most dominant program. And it was Jere Longman, the terrific writer from the New York Times, who noted that UCLA won 10 of the first 37 men's NCAA Tournaments, UConn won 11 of the first 35 women's tournaments and UCLA has faded on the men's side in years since their initial surge.
Can UConn avoid drifting away in the same manner?
Auriemma's answer will go over so well in one state and so poorly in 49.
"As long as I'm here," said Auriemma, 65, in his 35th season, "we don't have to worry about that. As long as I'm here, it's not an issue. I can't speak for after I leave, but as long as I'm coaching here, we won't be hard to find. We won't be drifting away. You'll know exactly where we are. And that's not going to change one iota."
What a weekend. Second-ranked Baylor was upset by Iowa State on Sunday, a day after No. 4 Louisville was upset by Florida State. That doesn't necessarily rattle the national picture too much, and UConn is probably still slotted for a No. 2 seed somewhere, just like last year, but the Huskies do look less vulnerable.
December, January, even the early part of February feel like stretches of a different basketball life. UConn has found itself and found a way to peak.
South Florida is a decent team. South Florida was 6-for-39 from the field at one point Sunday. South Florida was held to 1-for-13 from the field and committed nine turnovers in the first quarter alone, with UConn building an 18-5 lead.
But again, this isn't about numbers. It is about the sights and sounds. It is about the feel. UConn looks like it knows what it is doing more so now than at any other point.
"The only thing that changes in March, if you're any good, is you just get a lot smarter and tougher, mentally, because you know this is crunch time, right now," Auriemma said. "And you're either going to win because you're mentally tougher than the other guys, or you're not and you're going to lose. Plain and simple. Teams don't lose in March. You have to beat their ass.
"There's a mental toughness you need to have in March. Do we have it? We have more of it than we had in January, let's put it that way."

Demings may be in mix for Biden running mate

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Val Demings, of Orlando, has endorsed Joe Biden for president. Could Biden pick her as his running mate?
Florida, despite its electoral importance, has never produced a running mate for a major party presidential ticket.
But with razor-thin margins in seemingly every major statewide election, the temptation to swing the state with a homegrown favorite could prove hard to resist.
Demings, a former Orlando police chief, had been touted as a potential vice-presidential pick for Biden even before her profile-enhancing turn as a House impeachment manager in President Trump's Senate trial.
A New York Times story on Monday reported that Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was "focused on the idea of nominating an African-American woman for vice president, mulling names like Senator Kamala Harris, of California, Stacey Abrams, of Georgia, and Representative Val Demings, of Florida."
On Thursday, Demings said in an interview with CNN that she was "humbled" that her name has been raised.
And she did not rule out the possibility if Biden were to ask.
Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, said Demings "is a viable option" for Biden, who leads the Democratic primary race over U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders as California continues to count its votes.
"On the one hand, she doesn't have much political experience as some vice-presidential [possibilities]," Jewett said.
Harris, for one, has served as a U.S. senator and California attorney general before launching a run for president. Abrams served as Democratic minority leader of the Georgia state House.
"But [Demings] has an excellent track record of accomplishments throughout her career," Jewett said. "She's a pathbreaker."
Demings, who turns 63 on March 12, has three decades of experience with the Orlando Police Department and served as its first female chief. Since her election to Congress in 2016, Demings has served on the key Judiciary and Intelligence committees in addition to her selection as one of seven impeachment managers.
"Many times, vice presidents bring balance to a ticket," Jewett said. "Sometimes its racial or ethnic balance, sometimes its gender balance, sometimes it's ideological."
President Donald Trump, for example, selected Vice President Mike Pence to shore up his conservative bona fides. Biden brought decades of Washington experience to the more youthful Barack Obama's ticket, as did Dick Cheney for George W. Bush.
Yet, since Lyndon Johnson was credited with winning Texas for John F. Kennedy in 1960, running mates haven't helped that much. Either they were from states the candidate would have won anyway, like Biden's Delaware or Cheney's Wyoming, or they failed to win their swing states, like Texan Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 or North Carolina's John Edwards in 2004.
However, Florida U.S. Sen. Bob Graham was considered as a potential running mate for both Bill Clinton in 1992 and Al Gore in 2000 as a way of winning the state's electoral votes.
"If I were directing the Al Gore campaign, number one on my list would be Bob Graham," Washington pollster Bob Schroth said at the time.
"He would be a brilliant choice."
But Gore chose Joe Lieberman, of Connecticut, and Gore infamously lost Florida - and the election - by 537 votes.
Gov. Charlie Crist was mentioned as a potential vice president for Republican John McCain in 2008, Jewett said, "believe it or not."
Crist later left the party, ran for governor as a Democrat in 2014 and now serves in Congress as a Democrat.
This year, in addition to Demings, former Tallahassee mayor and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum had been talked about as a potential running mate for Sanders, who campaigned for Gillum in Central Florida in 2018.
But on Thursday, Gillum told CNN's David Axelrod that Sanders' praise of Fidel Castro would spur a Biden "runaway" in the March 17 primary. "Those comments will live [on] for a lot of people."

Biden, Sanders ready to battle As Florida's primary looms, here's where each candidate stands Election 2020

Texto completo: And then there were two.
The race for the Democratic nomination has come down to a battle between former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, after U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the race Thursday.
Florida, with its 219 pledged delegates up for grabs on March 17, could be the tipping point.
Biden and Sanders outlasted billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who spent tens of millions in Florida, as well as brief bursts in the polls for Warren, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris.
Hawaii U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also remains in the race, having won two delegates.
Campaigning in Florida had barely begun as Super Tuesday ended, with neither Biden nor Sanders having run that many ads or making any recent appearances - but that changed, with both Biden and Sanders launching ads in Florida showing them alongside former President Barack Obama.
Florida had been one of Bloomberg's strongest states, leading in many polls - so with his withdrawal, the state is now wide open.
Where does each candidate stand on the issues important to Floridians? Who has the best chance of winning the state, not only in the party primary but in November against President Donald Trump?
Joe Biden
Biden, 77, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, served as U.S. senator from Delaware for 36 years before becoming Obama's running mate and vice president.
Biden has swung through Central Florida for two fundraisers in 2019, and his wife, Jill, is leading the campaign's leadup to the Florida primary with visits to Orlando and Miami this weekend.
Biden says he's running for president - his third run including 1988 and 2008 - to "rebuild the middle class - and this time make sure everyone comes along."
His campaign is calling for "transformational investment" of $1.3 trillion over 10 years in U.S. infrastructure, which would "create good, union jobs that expand the middle class" by requiring federally funded projects employ workers trained in apprenticeship programs and use U.S.-sourced materials.
He also wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, and help state and local governments plan for the use of electric cars by investing in a national electric-vehicle charging network. Such moves to battle climate change could appeal to millions of coastal dwelling Floridians who already face rising sea levels.
He also plans to push for a national high-speed rail network - similar to the plans pushed by the Obama administration, which included funds for a high-speed link from Orlando to Tampa, but rejected by Gov. Rick Scott.
As part of his focus on the middle class, Biden's campaign talks about how they "deserve to retire with dignity - able to pay for their prescriptions and with access to quality, affordable long-term care" - positions important to a key Florida demographic of retirees.
The "Biden Plan" would repeal the "outrageous" exception allowing pharmaceutical corporations to avoid negotiating with Medicare over drug prices; limit the prices of new drugs that face no competition, as well as generic drugs; and allow people to buy prescription drugs from other countries.
Biden's campaign also pledged to protect the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, currently endangered by a Trump administration-backed lawsuit that reached the U.S. Supreme Court.
Biden also pledged to protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
While the Sanders campaign had criticized Biden for past statements talking about potential deals with Republicans that could include raising the age of eligibility or changing cost-of-living increases, Biden's 2020 plan would put the program "on a path to long-run solvency by asking Americans with especially high wages to pay the same taxes on those earnings that middle-class families pay."
It would also provide a bigger monthly check to those already on Social Security for 20 years, a minimum benefit for people who spend 30 years working and allow surviving spouses to keep a higher share of a deceased partner's benefit.
More than 4.5 million Floridians received Social Security benefits as of 2017, according to the Office of Retirement and Disability Policy, including 270,000 widowed spouses.
Biden's campaign also backs bipartisan legislation "protecting older workers from being discriminated against in the workforce."
On guns, "Joe Biden knows that gun violence is a public health epidemic."
His campaign stressed his record of having "taken on" the National Rifle Association in shepherding through the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which Biden has criticized Sanders for voting against. The Sanders campaign said he was opposed to "overreach" in creating a federal mandatory waiting period.
On immigration, Biden's campaign criticized Trump using family separation at the border - first carried out under the Obama administration in extreme cases but massively expanded under Trump - as "a weapon against desperate mothers, fathers, and children seeking safety and a better life."
He said he would reverse those Trump policies, including child separation and the restrictions placed on asylum-seekers.
Biden would also rescind the "un-American travel and refugee bans" and order an immediate review of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which has been withdrawn by the Trump administration for many refugees - or yet to be implemented despite bipartisan urging, as in the case of refugees from Venezuela - and create a "roadmap" to citizenship for undocumented residents.
Biden has also touted endorsements from 25 Puerto Rico officials and lawmakers, though both he and Sanders have not explicitly backed Puerto Rico statehood.
Bernie Sanders
Sanders, 78, a New York native, served as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and later served 18 years in the U.S. House before being elected to the U.S. Senate as an independent in 2006. He unsuccessfully ran for president in 2016, coming in second to Hillary Clinton.
He hasn't campaigned in Central Florida since his appearances on behalf of Andrew Gillum in 2018, the first of which helped Gillum with college-age voters in the gubernatorial primary. The second was an awkward appearance at UCF with Gillum's running mate Chris King, who declared he and Gillum were not self-described "socialists" like Sanders. Sanders volunteers opened a Central Florida office in Winter Park in mid-February.
Sanders' signature proposal is Medicare for All, a "single-payer, national health insurance program ... free at the point of service. No networks, no premiums, no deductibles, no copays, no surprise bills."
Sanders has been criticized by Biden and other candidates over the details of how it would be paid for, but Sanders' campaign proposed several possibilities including imposing a 7.5% income-based premium paid by employers, exempting the first $1 million in payroll to protect small businesses; eliminating health tax expenditures; and raising the top marginal income tax rate to 52% on income over $10 million.
Medicare coverage would also be expanded to include dental, hearing, vision, and home- and community-based long-term care, in-patient and out-patient services, mental health and substance abuse treatment, reproductive and maternity care, and prescription drugs. More than 4.5 million Floridians were enrolled in Medicare as of 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Costs for drugs would be capped at $200 a year under Sanders' plan, and he would eliminate "all of the $81 billion in past-due medical debt held by 79 million Americans - one in every six Americans."
Another key platform is the Green New Deal. It would "transform our energy system to 100 percent renewable energy and create 20 million jobs needed to solve the climate crisis," his campaign states.
Sanders would provide $200 billion to the Green Climate Fund, rejoin the Paris Climate Accord that Trump withdrew from, and invest in conservation and public lands.
His plan for tuition and debt-free public colleges is another signature proposal and key to his popularity among younger voters. His campaign also wants to cancel all student loan debt, about $1.6 trillion, for 45 million Americans and place a 1.88% cap on student loan interest rates going forward. Sanders has been looking to expand his viability with older voters, who have mostly swung towards Biden, by focusing more on his plans to expand Social Security benefits and quadruple funding for the Older Americans Act.
On immigration, Sanders would institute a moratorium on deportations "until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete," in addition to reinstating DACA and developing a "humane" asylum policy. He would also break up ICE and Customs and Border Patrol and redistribute their functions to other agencies, and dismantle "cruel and inhumane" deportation programs and detention centers.
Sanders is showing a boost in support among Hispanics in early primaries, including Nevada and California, according to exit polls, and his campaign has been critical of Biden for the number of deportations during Obama's presidency.

Texto completo: RED BANK – When it came time for his closing argument last summer, Christopher Placitella told the jury that he woke up in the middle of the night thinking about pain. It wasn't just physical pain that his client, D'Angela McNeill-George, endured, he said, but also the emotional pain of missing out on the simple, joyful moments in life: birthday parties, walks on the beach, her son's football games. "That's enjoyment of life," he said, showing photos of McNeill-George before she was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer that he argued was caused by talc in Johnson & Johnson's baby powder.
Placitella won the case that was noteworthy not only for the penalties — $37.2 million in compensatory damages and $750 million in punitive damages — but also for putting J&J CEO Alex Gorsky on the stand for the first time in a baby powder case.
The punitive award was quickly reduced by the judge to about $185 million based on state laws. But the case marked a milestone for Placitella, who has spent his career taking on deep-pocketed corporations and government agencies that he says have gone astray and hurt consumers.
His position hasn't always made him popular; product liability lawyers long have been associated with not-for-prime-time television commercials soliciting the sick and injured for personal gain.
But those who know Placitella say he is a true believer. He has tapped into a deep well of empathy to take leading roles in high-profile cases that include asbestos, tobacco, silicone implants, pain medicine and lead. The plight of his clients strikes him deeply.
"You can't do that and represent the people he has without having a deep-seated emotional connection with the people, as well as what they've gone through," said Moshe Maimon, a New York lawyer who, along with Chris Panatier, worked on the J&J case with Placitella.
Placitella, 63, is a partner with Cohen, Placitella and Roth, which has offices here and in Philadelphia.
He lives in Little Silver with his wife, Rachel, a former Monmouth County assistant prosecutor who works with him at the firm. They have three adult children: Jared, also a lawyer there; Justin; and Jennarose.
In the case against J&J, Placitella represented McNeill-George, 41, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who was referred to him after she was diagnosed in July 2016 with mesothelioma, a type of cancer that develops on the linings of internal organs.
He filed a lawsuit in Middlesex County, home of New Brunswick-based J&J, alleging her disease was caused by exposure to asbestos in talc that she used from the 1970s to the 1990s.
McNeill-George joined three other sets of plaintiffs in the case, and she said it was a stressful time. She traveled back and forth for the trial, all while coping with pain and raising her 8-year-old son. And she took the stand to discuss a time in her life that she said was not happy.
Working with Placitella "has been wonderful, honestly," she said recently. "He works real hard at what he (does) and, you know, he's not always a serious person. He's funny. He keeps you laughing, trying to keep a smile on my face. But at the end, he's like a shark."
The case spotlighting the safety of Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, one of its best-known products, began last summer and quickly turned contentious.
On the second day of the trial, Placitella said, he and his team returned to the Heldrich hotel in New Brunswick where they were staying, only to be locked out of their rooms.
When they asked a hotel manager about it, Placitella said, they were told J&J exercised its right to prevent them from staying there. The hotel eventually relented, he said.
"It's commonplace for opposing legal teams to stay at separate hotels as they prepare for an upcoming trial," a J&J spokesperson said in response. "The suggestion that Johnson & Johnson or any of its lawyers locked anyone out of a hotel is false."
The trial itself included fireworks. In the first phase, Judge Ana Viscomi struck down the entire closing argument from J&J's lawyer Diane Sullivan, admonishing her for accusing the plaintiffs' attorneys of creating evidence, according to a transcript.
The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering J&J to pay $37.2 million, including $14.7 million to McNeill-George.
In the second phase, J&J CEO Gorsky testified for the first time, shedding light on how the company tried to contain the fallout from reports in Reuters and The New York Times that alleged it knew for decades that its baby powder contained asbestos.
The jury came back with punitive damages of $750 million, which was reduced by Viscomi to $185 million; state law caps punitive damages at five times compensatory damages.
J&J noted that juries in the previous four talc trials found in the company's favor, and it plans to appeal.
"We sympathize with all who are suffering from cancer, and we understand patients and their families are seeking answers," a spokesperson said. "Consumers can be assured that more than 40 years of independent scientific evaluations confirm that Johnson's Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer."
For Placitella, the trial was something of a homecoming. He grew up in Woodbridge, Middlesex County. His father was a chemist; his mother, a real estate agent.
They wanted him to be a dentist, but he set his sights on being a lawyer.
"It's going to sound corny, but I always thought that was a route to be able to, you know, change things in society," he said.
Placitella went to Fordham University in New York City and then Syracuse University College of Law before returning to New Jersey to work at the Woodbridge law firm founded by David Wilentz, the famed former New Jersey attorney general.
He promptly worked on an asbestos case — and lost. Searching for answers, he decided the jury must not have liked his mustache, he said, so he shaved.
But he also picked up mentors, including Ronald Motley, a South Carolina lawyer who made his name taking on the tobacco industry.
Placitella's career rebounded, putting him at the forefront of some of New Jersey's highest-profile liability cases.
In 1998 he helped represent the state in its lawsuit against the tobacco industry, negotiating a settlement for $7.6 billion.
The next year, he represented consumers in a class action case against American Home Products, now Wyeth, which made the diet drug fen-phen, negotiating a settlement for as much as $4.8 billion.
He represented hundreds of consumers in lawsuits in the mid-2000's against Merck, arguing its blockbuster painkiller Vioxx had a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Merck won several of those cases, but eventually agreed to pay $4.9 billion as part of a settlement.
"He's very slow, calm, but very sure of himself," said Dan Myer, a founder the Princeton-based litigation support company Verus, who has known Placitella for 25 years. "There's no better lawyer out there than he is."
Placitella left Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer in 2004 and joined Stewart Cohen and Harry Roth in a new firm, giving him a chance to work together with his wife.
The Placitellas set up shop in a refurbished Victorian home in Red Bank, choosing the borough because they saw it as a diverse and accepting community, he said.
Nowadays, they are joined by their son, Jared, who works in the Philadelphia office, and their golden retriever, Sandy, who lounges in the Red Bank office.
Placitella is preparing for J&J's appeal in state court, and he is representing more clients in a federal lawsuit in Trenton, where upwards of 16,000 consumers say the company's baby powder caused not mesothelioma, but ovarian cancer.
Placitella sat in a conference room and recounted the recent trial, recreating his closing argument and noting that one of the plaintiffs in the case, Will Ronning, of Savannah, Georgia, died before it ended at the age of 48.
For Placitella, heartbreak comes with the territory.
"I get discouraged for a day, but I keep a global perspective," Placitella said. "I always tell everybody I haven't worked a day in my life since I got out of law school."
"People accuse me of being a true believer," he said.
"But I really think we can make a difference in the world, and we have, I think."

Ex-Ukraine ambassador at IU: Let diplomats do job

Texto completo: Of all the examples Marie Yovanovitch gave to illustrate the need to empower diplomats to do their jobs, none was more timely than what she said about coronavirus.
The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who gained public notice for her testimony in President Donald Trump's impeachment inquiry, was speaking Friday at Indiana University. It was the same day the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Indiana.
If the U.S. had better relationships with China, the country where the disease originated, perhaps Americans would have had more information earlier, she said. Perhaps national health experts could have traveled to China sooner.
"It turns out that the truth matters," Yovanovitch said, "and epidemics can't be subdued by tweet."
The comment was one of several that drew applause from a crowd spread throughout the lower rows of the IU Auditorium. Yovanovitch was the final speaker in the fifth-annual America's Role in the World Conference. It was the first conference without one of the IU Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies' namesakes.
Richard Lugar, a Republican who represented Indiana in the U.S. Senate for 36 years and died last April, was honored throughout the two-day conference. Among the acknowledgements was the creation of the Richard G. Lugar Award. Yovanovitch was the first recipient.
"As you can see, this award sits atop a compass symbolically reflecting Sen. Lugar's principle of integrity," said IU President Michael McRobbie. "It also reflects what we have recently described as the obligations of a foreign service officer to remain faithful to her true north, as you have done so brilliantly in dangerous and challenging posts overseas, and as all of us have recently witnessed in Washington, D.C."
In prepared remarks that followed the award presentation, Yovanovitch recalled her first meeting with Lugar. In the early 2000s, she was a mid-level embassy officer in the Ukraine. He was traveling through the former Soviet Union to check on the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program he created with U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia.
It was late on a hot August afternoon. Yovanovitch greeted Lugar on the tarmac and told him Leonid Kuchma, the president of Ukraine, wanted to see him. Lugar asked when the meeting was, and Yovanovitch replied, "right now."
The audience laughed, but Yovanovitch assured the crowd no one thought the situation was funny at the time. While Lugar's staff expressed frustration, the senator was unflappable and gracious, she said. He used the hour-long ride from the airport to prepare for the meeting. When he arrived, Lugar pushed on curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and broader issues to advance the U.S. agenda.
The way Lugar responded to the unwelcome news after a long trip taught Yovanovitch an important lesson about how people should treat each other to get the best results.
"He knew that you don't have to shout to be heard," she said. "In fact, if you are shouting, whether it is in person or on the internet, no one is listening."
Yovanovitch's prepared remarks preceded a conversation with Lee Feinstein, dean of the Hamilton Lugar School. The two worked together when Feinstein was a U.S. ambassador to Poland.
He recalled her as someone who was professional and serious. She was never one to call attention to herself, he said, but last fall she found herself in the national spotlight. He asked how that felt.
Yovanovitch said it was not something she would have chosen for herself. But those who choose to work for the American people will have to face challenges, she said. And she tried to meet those challenges the best she could.
To guide her, Yovanovitch said she thought about what mentors like her mother would have done. Then she also used what she called The New York Times test.
"If there's going to be a headline in The New York Times, what do you want it to say about you?" she said.
The event concluded with Yovanovitch responding to questions from IU students. One focused on what strategic threats students who pursue a career in government will have to face.
Her response was expansive, touching on everything from weapons of mass destruction — a topic she said is still relevant but not receiving the attention it deserves — to climate change to poverty. But she tried to end on a high note.
"I could go on and on," she said. "But I think, perhaps the positive side of that is there's still lots of work for you to do."

Sanders knocks Biden record

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Sunday criticized former Vice President Joe Biden's record on trade, war and Wall Street bailouts, after Biden scored a string of Democratic primary wins last week on Super Tuesday and amassed a delegate lead over Sanders.
Sanders made the rounds Sunday morning on the network and cable talk shows, where he knocked Biden's record as a U.S. senator, including votes to authorize the Iraq War and renew the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. He also criticized Biden for having supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China, as well as bailouts for Wall Street.
With six states set to hold nominating contests on Tuesday, Sanders said he was focused heavily on winning the primary in Michigan, where he defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. He touted the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who campaigned with him there Sunday.
"Michigan is an enormously important state," Sanders said on CNN's "State of the Union." Days earlier, Sanders canceled a rally planned for Mississippi, which is also holding a primary on Tuesday. He told CNN's Jake Tapper that Mississippi is a "going to be a tough state for us."
"Everybody knows there is limited amounts of time," he said on CNN. "You have to adjust the schedule at every moment."
With the Democratic primary now a two-man race, Sanders said the differences between him and Biden would emerge in sharper focus.
"And also, with two people in the race," Sanders said, "we have the opportunity to contrast our voting records, our vision for the future."
"People have a right to know what our record is and what our vision is for the future, and now that there are two people in the race, we're going to have the opportunity to make that debate."
Biden leads Sanders in total pledged delegates, 665-573, according to The New York Times. A candidate needs 1,991 total delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination.
Sanders vowed to support Biden if he became the nominee: "I'll support Joe if he wins, and he'll support me if I win."
Asked on ABC's "This Week" whether he would try to stay in the race if it was clear he was not headed for a plurality of votes, Sanders said: "Look, we will fight for every vote that we can, as we're - as we try to win this election. I'm not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won. But right now, that's a little bit premature. Let's not determine what will happen on Tuesday, what will happen in the future."
Sanders laid blame on the "establishment" for the consolidation of the moderate vote that occurred when two candidates - Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg - dropped out of the race before Tuesday's contests in 14 states and threw their support behind Biden. On Wednesday, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also withdrew from the race and endorsed Biden.
Sanders said, "One of the things that I was kind of not surprised by is the power of establishment to force Amy Klobuchar, who had worked so hard, Pete Buttigieg, who, you know, really worked extremely hard as well, out of the race."
On NBC's "Meet the Press," Sanders said: "If they had not withdrawn from the race before Super Tuesday, which was kind of a surprise to a lot of people, I suspect we would have won in Minnesota, we would have won in Maine, we would have won in Massachusetts. The turnout may have been a little bit different."

Texto completo: Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told executives that he regretted voicing criticisms of the company's leadership and former CEO in a recent interview with the New York Times.
Mr. Calhoun, who started as CEO in January, is dealing with the fallout of his candid assessment of Boeing's problems, telling executives they have his support despite sometimes harsh comments published in the article.
"I am both embarrassed and regretful about the article," Mr. Calhoun wrote in a message addressed to Boeing senior leaders, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. "It suggests I broke my promise to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the executive team and our people that I would have their back when it counted most. I want to reassure you that my promise remains intact."
Mr. Calhoun, who served on Boeing's board for about a decade before being appointed CEO, had vowed to make a fresh start for the beleaguered company. He has said he planned to focus on rebuilding trust in the company and being more transparent.
Boeing has been in crisis since two of its 737 MAX planes crashed within a five-month period, killing 346 people. The MAX has been grounded world-wide since last March and Boeing had to shut down production of the plane this year. The crashes have drawn scrutiny of the plane maker's engineering culture and damaged the company's relationships with suppliers, customers and regulators.
In a preliminary report released Friday, House investigators said production pressures, faulty assumptions, and a "culture of concealment," combined with insufficient federal safety oversight, led to the two crashes.
Separately, in Boeing's latest reported production lapse, the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday proposed a $19.7 million penalty against the company for installing unapproved sensors on hundreds of planes, including some MAX jets. A Boeing spokesman said the company has done a thorough internal review and implemented changes to address the FAA's concerns.
Mr. Calhoun told the New York Times that the challenges he is facing are more than he'd anticipated, according to the March 5 article. "And it speaks to the weaknesses of our leadership," he said.
He said Mr. Muilenburg may have increased production of the 737 MAX too quickly at the expense of quality. Mr. Calhoun suggested that Mr. Muilenburg had been chasing a higher share price, according to the article.
"I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis, whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up, or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase," Mr. Calhoun said, adding that the board had trusted Mr. Muilenburg and his proven record of taking risks that had paid off.
Mr. Muilenburg couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Calhoun publicly expressed support for Mr. Muilenburg in the months leading up to his removal in December, but the board eventually became frustrated with Mr. Muilenburg's overly optimistic projections and convinced that he had mismanaged the company's relationship with the FAA, potentially complicating the plane's return to service, people familiar with the matter have said.
Mr. Calhoun had become more engaged in managing the company after being made chairman in October, when the board stripped Mr. Muilenburg of that role, but has sought to draw a clean break from the company's past missteps.
"I watched the same movie you did -- I think I was in the front-row seat, and I might come to exactly the same conclusions you do," Mr. Calhoun said in a call with reporters in January. "My leadership role here at Boeing is intended to make changes that correct a lot of those situations."
A Boeing spokesman said Mr. Calhoun wanted to provide Boeing executives with more context about what he had said in the interview.
"It is important to Dave that his teammates have a full understanding of his views and the context they were given in," a Boeing spokesman said. "And like many interviews, not everything makes it into the story, and Dave wanted to share some of the points he made about the good work of our team and the strength of our portfolio of products and services."
In the message on Friday, Mr. Calhoun said he had wanted to speak candidly about the company's challenges, but hadn't intended to undermine its current leadership team.
He said he was invested in Mr. Muilenburg's success, and that the disappointments he discussed in the interview mostly related to the company's failure to return the plane to service going into the fourth quarter.
"Now is not the time to look behind us. I regret doing it. Now is the time to look forward and build on our foundation," he wrote.
Mr. Calhoun said he maintained his commitment to being more transparent.
"I have said that transparency is a messy process but worth it in the end, and I still believe it."

ELIZABETH WARREN IS NOT A VICTIM OF SEXISM THE MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR WAS SIMPLY A BAD CANDIDATE

Texto completo: When Elizabeth Warren bowed out of the presidential race Thursday, the prevailing media narrative was that Democratic voters are sexist.
Headline after headline blamed the candidate's failures on the pernicious effect of sexism. "America Punished Elizabeth Warren for her Competence," runs the header over Megan Garber's article at The Atlantic. Just underneath, Ms. Garber makes her thesis clear: "The country still doesn't know what to make of a woman - in politics and beyond - who refuses to qualify her success."
Jessica Valenti was blunter over at Medium: "Don't tell me this isn't sexism," Ms. Valenti said of the news that Warren had suspended her campaign.
A CNN panel even blamed sexism for questions directed at the candidate's health care and tax plans.
The alternative explanation for Ms. Warren's unpopularity, of course, is that what moves The New York Times to ecstasy - detailed plans advocating decriminalization of border hopping coupled with factually dubious stories of personal female victimhood - does not move typical Democrats to the same, let alone Americans as a whole.
The Democratic Party's voting base, for now anyway, remains broader than the Acela-corridor affluent and educated liberals who thrilled to Ms. Warren's siren song.
In an age where authenticity is one of the electorate's most prized qualities, she was easily outstripped by both Bernie Sanders - who is authentically a commune-ejected, Castro-loving communist - and Joe Biden, who seems authentically like a lost boomer who still thinks it's 1990.
If the source of Ms. Warren's downfall was sexism, it certainly crops up in some odd places.
Two-thirds of female voters in Ms. Warren's home state of Massachusetts - where the electorate should have been most familiar with her record and supposedly "stellar" plans - voted for other candidates in the primary. She finished third and fourth among women in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively.
Research does not support Ms. Warren's contention that her sex was a handicap. While more men than women take a shot at winning political office, when women do run they are at least equally likely to win their races as are male candidates. In fact, some studies point to the power of incumbency - rather than sexism of voters - as the chief obstacle to electing more women to political office.
Ms. Warren was a bad candidate. She gave evasive answers to tough questions, and the personal stories on which she heavily relied, from her claims to Native American heritage to alleging a firing based on pregnancy, often failed to check out.
Ironically, the narrative of female victimhood, on which Ms. Warren relied not only throughout her campaign but to explain its end, is itself overwhelmingly politically unpopular.
Ms. Warren hammered the sexist theme home against Mr. Sanders and Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage to cheers from the media, but polls show political correctness is exceedingly unpopular - and not just on the right.
Fully 80% of Americans report in surveys that they believe political correctness is a problem for the country. That distaste holds strongly across racial groups, and even to some extent across age groups. It's no accident that the strongest predictor of "wokeism" - affluence - is a quality Ms. Warren's support base also shared.
There is no evidence that Democratic voters, oor American voters as a whole, have deep objections to voting for a female president. The majority of registered voters are "very ready" or "extremely ready" to vote for a woman, and only 16% claimed they were not.
Paradoxically, blaming sexism for the failures of female candidates may itself be creating voter mistrust that did not exist beforehand, as voters in the same survey underestimated the number of their fellow Americans who felt as positively as they did about electing a woman.
Progressives teaching their daughters that sexism is what stood in Ms. Warren's way may in fact be creating the very conditions they decry, in which future voters - and candidates - hold back out of misplaced fears that a woman cannot win the presidency.

AJC AT THE GOLD DOME HIV LAWS: Ga. may ease HIV laws that date to 1980s: Though no opposition has organized to bipartisan legislation, some lawmakers question its wisdom.

Texto completo: Legislation moving through the Georgia House would overhaul HIV laws for the first time in a generation, reflecting changing public attitudes even as the state struggles to tamp down the transmission of new cases.
House Bill 719 seeks to lower the state's criminal penalties for HIV-positive people who have sex, share needles or donate blood without making known their status. Those who don't disclose face felony charges and up to 10 years in prison even if the virus is not transmitted. The new bill would downgrade penalties to misdemeanors punishable by up to a year behind bars, but only if criminal intent to infect someone can be proved.
The bipartisan legislation sailed through the Republican-led Health and Human Services Committee unanimously Feb. 25, and the powerful House Rules panel is expected to consider it soon. Though no opposition has organized, some lawmakers question the wisdom of the move.
Supporters of the measure say Georgia's HIV laws are ineffective, scientifically outdated and stigmatizing.
They "essentially say that people who are living with HIV are bad people and that we should be leery of them, that they have bad intentions," said Eric Paulk, deputy director of the LGBTQ advocacy organization Georgia Equality.
The state's HIV laws trace back to the late 1980s, when AIDS panic gripped the nation and legislators faced intense pressure to act. Nearly three dozen states passed similar laws. Proponents said the statutes were necessary to protect unknowing victims and law enforcement officers.
One Georgia law deems it felony assault on a police officer by spitting, biting or throwing bodily fluids such as blood, saliva or feces with the intent to transmit HIV and is punishable by up to 20 years in jail.
More than 571 people had been arrested under Georgia's laws between 1988 and September 2017, according to the UCLA School of Law's Williams Institute, or roughly 27 people a year.
Proponents of HB 719 say the legislation -- which would also eliminate HIV-specific penalties for assaulting officers -- will help bring Georgia laws in line with current science, which finds negligible potential for transmitting HIV through spitting, biting or throwing fluids.
The virus is mainly transmitted through unprotected sex or sharing needles, according to the CDC.
Changing politics
HIV is a major problem in the South and metro Atlanta in particular.
Georgia had the nation's fourth-highest rate of new diagnoses in 2018, with 2,552 new HIV cases, according to the CDC. The Williams Institute estimated that Fulton and DeKalb counties were home to nearly half of the state's HIV-positive population.
President Donald Trump has pledged to end the spread of HIV by 2030, and his administration allocated nearly a half-million dollars in October to help four metro Atlanta counties manage their cases.
Georgia lawmakers have for years tried to overhaul the state's laws, but proponents think the political climate is right to advance legislation this year.
Legislators legalized needle exchange programs last year, and a state study committee in 2017 recommended eliminating many of the state's HIV-related penalties, with exceptions for sexual assaults and clear intent to infect.
Influential law enforcement groups, including the Georgia Sheriffs' Association, have remained neutral about HB 719, which could boost its chances of advancing in the Republican-dominated Statehouse.
A spokeswoman for the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia said the group provided assistance in drafting the bill but will not be taking a position on it.
Some Republican lawmakers, however, are wary of downgrading offenses rel ated to knowingly spreading HIV to a misdemeanor.
"I have heard from a number of members who have concerns with reducing the penalties for those individuals who have received an HIV diagnosis and still knowingly engage in intercourse with a partner without notifying the partner of their diagnosis," said Trey Kelley of Cedartown, the House GOP's whip, responsible for ensuring party discipline on votes.
"These actions could have devastating lifelong consequences to the unknowing partner, and our law should have strict penalties to serve as a deterrent to this type of behavior," Kelly added.
Nina Martinez, an activist with the Georgia HIV Justice Coalition who supports the bill, said the status quo is dangerous.
"People living with HIV have been harmed or killed for disclosing," said Martinez, who last year became the first-known HIV-positive kidney donor. "Disclosure may be the morally right thing to do, but nondisclosure cannot be construed to be demonstrative of criminal intent to transmit to another person."
Several states, including Texas, Iowa and California, have changed their HIV laws in recent years, many compelled by cases of racial inequalities surrounding such statutes.
A notorious case played out several years ago in Missouri, where Michael L. Johnson, an African American former college wrestler, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after six former sex partners, half of them white, testified that he lied about his HIV-positive status. Johnson's original sentence was longer than the state's average for second-degree murder, according to The New York Times, and Johnson was released from prison after an appeals court ruled his trial was "fundamentally unfair."
In a well-known 2005 Georgia case, the 26-yearold head of the Emory School of Medicine's Honor Council was sentenced to two years in prison and eight years' probation for engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners, even though none tested positive for HIV.
House Health and Human Services Chairwoman Sharon Cooper, R-Marietta, one of the bill's sponsors, said "it's the right time to do something" on the issue.
"I think there's been a lot of research that has helped back up the kind of changes that we want to make," Cooper said. "Sometimes you need that kind of research and medical backup to get things changed."

HIV AND AIDS TODAY
Advances in treatment options mean HIV and AIDS are no longer the death sentence they once were.A widely available medication can help block transmission of HIV during sex, but it's pricey and harder to access in poor and rural areas.
The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranks the South first for rates of new HIV cases compared with other regions of the country. In 2014, the South had an HIV diagnosis rate of 18.5 per 100,000 people, compared with 14.2 in the Northeast, 11.2 in the West and 8.2 in the Midwest. In 2018,Georgia had the nation's fourth-highest number of HIV diagnoses among
adults and adolescents, according to the CDC, with
2,552new cases.
Overall, the rate of new HIV infections in the U.S.has reduced by more than two-thirds since the height of the epidemic in the mid-1980s, but the CDC still describes the situation an "epidemic."

Texto completo: A deputy commissioner at the New York City Commission on Human Rights writes about the need to unite to fight anti-Semitism. Also: A legacy of Pete Buttigieg; the national security adviser and the president.
To the Editor:
Re "Anxious Times for 'Visible Jews' as Communities Clash" (news article, Feb. 17) and "I Am a Haredi Jew, Not an Extremist" (Op-Ed, Feb. 21):
As a secular Jewish woman, I can dwell on the seemingly vast distance between my conservative Jewish upbringing and that of Haredi Jews. But now is the time for secular Jews to reach across that distance and build connection and solidarity. After all, although anti-Semitism takes different forms, it affects all of us.
Last year, as I dropped my 2-year-old at his small neighborhood Jewish preschool in brownstone Brooklyn, I pulled back a makeshift covering on the door to find a swastika there, discovered (and covered up) by staff members minutes before morning drop-off.
As a deputy commissioner at the New York City Commission on Human Rights, I helped develop a recent public awareness campaign to combat anti-Semitism. It features the names and faces of both Haredi and secular Jews smiling proudly at the camera.
It was intentional, and no small feat, to make sure that New York City's diverse and beautiful mosaic of Jewish communities were represented side by side. No matter the particulars of what may divide us, our shared heritage and common threat must unite us to say that we belong here and that anti-Semitism does not.

How Mayor Pete Showed Me the Way
To the Editor:
Re "Mayor Pete Flew Sky High" (column, nytimes.com, March 1):
I teared up reading Frank Bruni's moving reflection on Pete Buttigieg's historic candidacy. Mayor Pete meant so much to me personally.
Right around the time when he announced his exploratory committee, I was told by my rabbinical school that I could not be ordained as a rabbi because of my public identity as a gay man and engagement to another man.
That was a dark time for me personally, and reading Mayor Pete's book and getting to know him inspired me and presented me with a role model.
Mr. Bruni focused on Pete's thoughtfulness. Watching how Pete navigated his position as a trailblazer without being defined by it helped me in my own similar path, as I was the first openly gay man ordained by an Orthodox rabbi anywhere, in May 2019.
Thank you, Mayor Pete.

The National Security Adviser's Role
To the Editor:
Re "For National Security Council, a Mission Turns Upside Down" (front page, Feb. 22):
According to one who should know -- Gen. Colin Powell, the former national security adviser under President Ronald Reagan -- the head of the National Security Council is "first and foremost" a process manager.
He continued: "He must insure that the president gets full, objective, coherent and balanced recommendations on issues he must decide. ... He cannot allow unpleasant information to be shunted aside. ... He cannot allow the decision process to ill serve the president by keeping from him minority perspectives. ... The national security adviser must make sure that the president hears the strongest views as well as the weakest views."
But this process will work only if the president himself wants to hear these views and consider them.
Apparently President Trump does not. Only his views count.

'Saturday Night Live' Had a Plan for That

Texto completo: The senator played herself in a surprise appearance in an episode that featured the Weeknd as the musical guest.
It started out familiar: a "Saturday Night Live" sketch centered on impersonations of political figures. But then it was rescued by something even more familiar: the show's ability to wrangle real-life politicians to come on the show during an election season -- which in this case yielded Senator Elizabeth Warren, who announced on Thursday that she was exiting the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The sketch -- which led an episode hosted by Daniel Craig and featuring the musical guest the Weeknd -- was framed as an episode of the Fox News program "The Ingraham Angle," with Kate McKinnon playing its host, Laura Ingraham. She traded quips with her cast mates Cecily Strong (playing Jeanine Pirro), Mikey Day and Alex Moffat (as Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump) and the "S.N.L." veteran Darrell Hammond, who returned in his recurring role as the "Hardball" host Chris Matthews (for what could be his last go-round as that character).
Then McKinnon introduced Warren, playing herself, and asked her how she'd been since dropping out of the race.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"You know, I'm doing just fine," Warren said. "My friends and family have been so supportive. They've been calling nonstop, asking: 'Are you OK? What do you need? Were you electable?' That kind of thing."
McKinnon set up what she said would be footage of Warren debating Mike Bloomberg but was instead a viral clip of Warren's dog, Bailey, devouring a stolen burrito. Asked if she was the dog or the burrito in that clip, Warren responded, "I was the dog"
Reminded that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were both still hoping for her endorsement, Warren indicated that she was not yet ready to choose one of them. "It's tough," she said. "Maybe I'll just pull a New York Times and endorse them both."
Warren said she had no regrets about how she had run her campaign. "We built a wide coalition of teachers, preschool teachers, middle-school teachers, and teachers' pets," she said. "And not only did I not accept money from billionaires, I got to give one a swirly on live TV."
In the meantime, Warren said, she was practicing a regimen of self-care: "Hanging out with my dog, Bailey. Prank-calling big banks. Drag-racing Subarus. Avoiding Twitter."
Just as the sketch seemed to be wrapping up, McKinnon raced onto the screen, now dressed as Warren, whom she had impersonated many times. "I wanted to put on my favorite outfit to thank you for all that you've done in your lifetime," McKinnon told her.
Warren replied, "I'm not dead -- I'm just in the Senate."
Opening Monologue of the Week
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
At the start of the week, Daniel Craig was getting ready to appear on "Saturday Night Live" in conjunction with his new James Bond movie, which was scheduled to premiere in April. On Wednesday, those plans changed when the film, "No Time to Die," was postponed until November amid concerns about the worldwide spread of the coronavirus.
That didn't prevent Craig from having some fun with his superspy character, as he introduced what he said would be a clip from "No Time to Die" but was instead a lengthy Bond parody in which 007 can't quite get away from a craps table where he's having a lucky streak.
(And if you were hoping Craig would poke fun at his hit mystery caper "Knives Out," he did that, too, in a sketch in which Beck Bennett played the accent coach training him to play the Southern detective Benoit Blanc.)
Soap Opera Parody of the Week
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As a narrator informs viewers at the start of "The Sands of Modesto," a tongue-in-cheek soap opera, "With the outbreak of COVID-19, otherwise known as the Coronavirus, the producers of today's episode of 'The Sands of Modesto' would like to remind viewers that the staging of certain scenes has been altered for the actors' safety." That meant that when two long-separated lovers (played by Craig and McKinnon) were reunited, they conducted their affair through a pane of plexiglass and a layer of Saran Wrap.
When Cecily Strong caught them in the act, she thoroughly sanitized her hands before air-slapping her romantic rival.
Weekend Update Jokes of the Week
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Over at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff about the 2020 presidential election.
"Last week we had six Democratic candidates," Jost began:
and this week it's become like my dad's favorite radio station -- just the oldies. Joe Biden is now the front-runner and just picked up an endorsement from Michigan's governor only days before the state's primary. And it makes sense that Michigan would love Biden, because it kind of looks like a hand trying to touch a lady's hair.
Jost paused while the audience laughed at a map of Michigan, then continued:
I've got to say, honestly, I could not be more excited for Biden-Trump debates. They're going to be the first debates that have to be moderated by a Jamaican nurse. As well as the only debates that air on the Turner Classic Movies channel. And I don't want the moderator to ask them about anything political. I want all the questions to be like, "Who was the greatest slugger of the 50s? Who's your favorite white boxer?" At this point, between Bernie, Biden and Trump, I think the next debate should just be on that cruise ship. And whichever one of them can beat coronavirus becomes our next president.
Che picked up the thread:
I don't know who's going to win the nomination, but watching white people fight over these old dudes is hilarious. I don't even care who wins, just as long as they beat Trump. I'm not even really a Democrat, I just vote not-Republican. Democrats are like condoms to me. I mean, I'll use them because it's safer, I guess. But it doesn't feel good.
Classic 'S.N.L.' Throwback of the Week
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In another sketch that began with a clever fake-out, a group of partygoers at a wedding reception asked a fellow guest to remove her obtrusive gas mask and -- surprise! -- it was Debbie Downer, the perpetually morbid character whom Rachel Dratch first portrayed back in 2004, spawning a slang term for that person in every group who always has to be the buzz kill.
Naturally, she was fretting about the coronavirus. And also feline AIDS.
And if you like comically irritating "S.N.L." characters of a different vintage, Cecily Strong appeared on Weekend Update as The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation With at a Party.
Music Video of the Week
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If you've already got the Weeknd as your musical guest, you might as well put him to work on an irresistible slow jam about guys who can't quite understand how they found themselves in the doghouse with their significant others. "On the Couch" is sung -- quite well, one might add! -- by Kenan Thompson, Chris Redd and the Weeknd, but its closing verses belong to Ego Nwodim, Melissa Villaseñor and Heidi Gardner, who clarify why these chumps deserved their punishments (and probably worse).

Texto completo: A fictitious Kevin Bacon (played by Kevin Bacon), an improvised space opera and a Midwestern gothic horror story are audio dramas you might want to add to your queue.
As the country hurtles toward the election in November, politically minded podcasts are increasingly popping up in our feeds. Members of Congress are employing the medium as a personal soap box for their constituents. Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas ("Hold These Truths") and Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina ("Clyburn Chronicles") began their shows this year, and Senator Ted Cruz's erratically released impeachment podcast ("Verdict With Ted Cruz") briefly topped Apple Podcast's charts. And last month it was announced that Hillary Clinton would be starting her own iHeartRadio podcast this spring.
You can also add some satirical news podcasts, with a heavy dose of politics, to your listening diet. In Late January, The Onion created an audio version of its website called "The Topical," and the team behind the British political comedy "The Bugle" launched "The Last Post," hosted by Alice Fraser, which brings "aah, clever" titters every morning in 16 minutes or less.
But amid all the political noise of the year, 2020 has also delivered plenty of new, creative fare that may not top the charts, but might just be your next favorite podcast. Here, along with some returning favorites, are others worth checking out.
'The Last Degree of Kevin Bacon'
"What's the point of being six degrees from everyone, if all you really want is a best friend?" That's the question eating at actor Kevin Bacon in this Spotify-exclusive fiction comedy produced by Funny or Die. In "The Last Degree," this fictitious version of Kevin, played by the actor himself, finally finds a best friend in Randy Beslow (voiced by Matt Walsh of "Veep"). Kevin is so desperate for friendship that he's oblivious to the fact that Randy is homicidally obsessed with him, having held a deadly grudge since he lost out on the lead role in "Footloose" to a young and rising Bacon. The show is peppered with goofy celebrity cameos, like Kyra Sedgwick (Bacon's actual wife) as a worm enthusiast who whips out her "Closer" blazer when Randy piques her suspicions. Because it's Funny or Die, the plot is solidly absurd -- Kevin's plan to get more friends involves securing the intellectual property rights to "Frog and Toad," the children's book series -- and is filled with possibly every Kevin Bacon movie reference imaginable.

'My Year in Mensa'
Mensa, the "high I.Q. society" that accepts only those who pass a (largely disproved) intelligence test, is ripe material for the humorist Jamie Loftus in this four-part series. Using her "degree in radio production for the first time" and making liberal use of air horns, Loftus charts her journey of joining Mensa, reporting on it from the inside, then getting harassed by its online group and eventually meeting her cyberbullies in person at the organization's annual gathering. The result is an admittedly biased, often hilarious study in the ways we treat strangers who challenge our chosen identities on the internet.
'As It Happens: Song a Day'
You might have heard of Jonathan Mann, or perhaps you've seen his YouTube channel. The singer/songwriter has been writing and recording a new song every day since Jan. 1, 2009. So after 4000 days of songs, the musician has turned to podcasting, naturally. Every episode follows the creation of a song, boiled down to about 20 minutes. Listen as Mann comes up with an idea, writes lyrics, builds a track, chooses different instruments, sings, plays and puts it all together into an ultimately satisfying bop. Mann's true mission is to share the parts that aren't seen in a finished artistic product: the failure, the frustrations, the constant life interruptions.
'In Those Genes'
The spit-in-a-vial DNA testing trend offers a fuller understanding of your roots. But when it comes to the descendants of the African diaspora, learning your roots necessarily requires more context to fully appreciate the beauty and journey of your genome. On "In Those Genes," Janina M. Jeff lays out the historical and future implications of genetic testing in the African-American community. The project goes beyond information-sharing; each episode makes the case to black Americans that their genome is invaluable, their genetic legacy as integral as their cultural one, and that they must become active participants in how both are handled. With "hip-hop inspired" production and illuminating guest interviews, Dr. Jeff also pushes the conversation out of the lab by exploring other forms of identity, like using names as a means to reclaim and assert one's history. She also dispels myths surrounding genetic differences among races, like the eugenics used to justify race-based slavery. Every topic is handled thoughtfully and with intention, and the result is a thoroughly entertaining lesson in the genetic legacy of today's black Americans.
And some returning series whose backlog is worth a binge:
'Mission to Zyxx'
The most ambitious space opera comedy is finally back in orbit, having launched its fourth season earlier this month. Created and performed by improvisers who met at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, "Mission to Zyxx" follows hapless ambassadors who alternate between working for and rebelling against the galaxy's overlords. The core protagonists include a sentient and felonious starship who is a washed-up movie star, a lizard-bird bureaucrat, a gender- and sexually fluid security officer whose hulking body is full of chutes and flaps, a sassy know-it-all protocol and diplomatic relations droid, and an occasionally muddled hero honing his innate power (known as "The Space"). What makes the hilarious show truly outstanding audio is its obsessive editing and sound design. In the new season's premiere, the first six minutes alone is the result of 40 ours of sound design.
'The Heart'
Originally a Montreal radio show called "Audio Smut," Radiotopia's "The Heart" has been through many evolutions. Now, after a two-year break, it's back, filled as before with queer and radically feminist stories, told with immersive and experimental sound design. Its erstwhile host, Kaitlin Prest, has handed over the reins of "The Heart" to focus on building her audio-as-art company "Mermaid Palace," which launched a new audio drama, "Asking For It," last month. So now "The Heart" is in the able hands of the former hosts of "bitchface" podcast, Nicole Kelly (NK) and Phoebe Unter, who introduced themselves to the audience with their first series, "Divesting From People Pleasing." In this mini-season, NK builds a story of about her struggle to navigate the task of pleasing of white people as often the only black woman in a group. The show remains a shockingly intimate, deeply personal communication of what it means to be alive in a human body.
'Unwell'
When Lillian Harper returns to Mt. Absalom, Ohio, to care for her ailing estranged mother, she doesn't expect to stay long. But the family home, which happens to be the town's boardinghouse, is full of oddball guests, unexplained phenomena and some spirits of its own, requiring her to stick around longer than she expected. To say "Unwell" is simply a horror audio drama would be giving it short shrift, since several episodes qualify as, at most, eerie. Thanks to a fabulously diverse cast of characters, many of the compelling performed episodes are better classified as goofy, romantic, funny or heart warming. But there is always something uncanny lingering at the edges. The second season just began and the show already is ramping up the horror, the conspiracy, and the urgency of this sleepy town awakening to its whitewashed, violent past.
'Fiasco'
After leaving "Slow Burn" to create content for the subscription-based listening app Luminary, the "Fiasco" team returns this month for a second season. The host, Leon Neyfakh, and his team have proved their knack for uncovering the forgotten minutiae of U.S. politics, and telling the story of political scandals through the flawed humans involved in them. Last season, it was the 2000 election. This time, it's the Iran-contra affair, as they tell the story of a secret arms deal with Iran, in violation of U.S. policy. Some profits from the sale went to finance right-wing guerrillas fighting the government in Nicaragua. The eight-episode season zooms in on obscure characters and moments to paint a fuller picture of a convoluted bit of geopolitics that damaged the Reagan presidency.

Texto completo: He provided the administrative know-how that got the theater troupe off the ground in 1967. That he was white drew some criticism.
Gerald S. Krone, a theater manager and producer who in 1967 joined with Douglas Turner Ward and Robert Hooks to found the Negro Ensemble Company, a New York theater troupe that championed black writers, actors and themes in what was then a largely white theatrical landscape, died on Feb. 20 at his home in Philadelphia. He was 86.
His longtime partner, Ivan Kaminoff, said the cause was Parkinson's disease.
Mr. Krone, who was managing various Off Broadway theaters at the time, brought administrative savvy to the new enterprise, while Mr. Hooks, an actor and producer, and Mr. Ward, an actor and playwright, concentrated on the creative side. Mr. Krone stood out in the partnership because he was white.
Black activism was gaining a new militance in the second half of the 1960s, and before long the company, which took up residence at St. Marks Playhouse in the East Village, was drawing criticism over, among other things, the participation of Mr. Krone and other white people.
"We were damned for not being in Harlem," Mr. Ward wrote in a 1968 essay in The New York Times defending the company at the end of its first season, "accused of conspiring against black playwrights, judged traitorous for hiring a few white people, and stigmatized with a host of other mortal and venial sins negating our right to be called a black theater."
Criticism notwithstanding, the partnership enjoyed quick success, and the Negro Ensemble Company went on to send three plays to Broadway: "The River Niger" in 1973, "The First Breeze of Summer" in 1975 and "Home" in 1980. In 1981 it staged, Off Broadway, the premiere of Charles Fuller's "A Soldier's Play," with a cast that included Denzel Washington and Samuel L. Jackson; the play won the Pulitzer Prize.
Less than two years after it was founded, the company received a special Tony Award, which Mr. Ward and Mr. Krone were on hand to accept. After Mr. Ward spoke, Mr. Krone addressed the audience, thanking his black colleagues "for being courageous enough -- in this rather difficult, confusing, disturbing time -- for being courageous enough to give me, a white man, an opportunity to be part of a very important, dynamic, wonderful black theater, which is theirs."
Gerald Sidney Krone was born on Feb. 25, 1933, in Memphis to Irving and Eva Sauer Krone. He grew up in Memphis and attended Hume High School, where Elvis Presley was a class or two behind him; Mr. Krone once served as M.C. at a school event and introduced Presley, Mr. Kaminoff said.
Mr. Krone served in the Army during the Korean War, then graduated from Washington University in St. Louis. He served an internship with the Royal Shakespeare Company.
For a time he was married to Dorothy Olim, and they were business partners as well, working on theater productions in management capacities as well as forming Krone-Olim Advertising. The marriage ended in divorce.
Mr. Hooks met Mr. Krone and Ms. Olim when they were all involved in a production at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1964. When Mr. Hooks decided to produce two of Mr. Ward's one-act plays, "Happy Ending" and "Day of Absence," the next year at St. Marks, he asked them to serve as managers.
The production generated buzz, and in the aftermath Mr. Ward wrote a provocative essay in The New York Times that bore the headline "American Theater: For Whites Only?"
"Despite an eminent handful," he wrote, "Negro dramatists remain sparse in number, productions sporadic at most, and scripts too few to indicate discernible trends."
The article caught the attention of the Ford Foundation, which asked Mr. Hooks and Mr. Ward to meet to discuss a possible grant.
"Having Gerald right there as our general manager and numbers man, we asked him to come with us," Mr. Hooks recalled in a telephone interview. The foundation asked for a proposal that would advance black theater; Mr. Krone was instrumental in drawing it up and securing a $ 1.5 million grant, which got the Negro Ensemble Company started.
"We were in the right place at the right time and were able to create a movement," Mr. Hooks said, "and Gerald was a big part of that."
The funding financed a company of 13 actors, workshops and a four-play season the first year. Mr. Ward was the artistic director, Mr. Hooks the executive director and Mr. Krone the administrative director. The first production, Peter Weiss's "Song of the Lusitanian Bogey," opened in January 1968.
Once its Ford Foundation money ran out, the company faced occasional financial crises. Mr. Krone remained as administrative director until 1982, when he left to work in television news, though he remained on the board of directors for some years.
In addition to Mr. Kaminoff, whom he married in 2013 after two decades together, Mr. Krone is survived by a brother, Norman.
The Negro Ensemble Company continues today with workshops and intermittent productions. In 2016 the company staged a revival of "Day of Absence," one of the plays that brought the three founders together in 1965.
"The N.E.C. served its purpose," Mr. Hooks said, "and is still serving its purpose."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Anxious Times for 'Visible Jews' as Communities Clash" (news article, Feb. 17) and "I Am a Haredi Jew, Not an Extremist" (Op-Ed, Feb. 21):
As a secular Jewish woman, I can dwell on the seemingly vast distance between my conservative Jewish upbringing and that of Haredi Jews. But now is the time for secular Jews to reach across that distance and build connection and solidarity. After all, although anti-Semitism takes different forms, it affects all of us.
Last year, as I dropped my 2-year-old at his small neighborhood Jewish preschool in brownstone Brooklyn, I pulled back a makeshift covering on the door to find a swastika there, discovered (and covered up) by staff members minutes before morning drop-off.
As a deputy commissioner at the New York City Commission on Human Rights, I helped develop a recent public awareness campaign to combat anti-Semitism. It features the names and faces of both Haredi and secular Jews smiling proudly at the camera.
It was intentional, and no small feat, to make sure that New York City's diverse and beautiful mosaic of Jewish communities were represented side by side. No matter the particulars of what may divide us, our shared heritage and common threat must unite us to say that we belong here and that anti-Semitism does not.

Texto completo: The Taliban have read the secret annexes of the recently signed peace deal. But most Americans haven't, nor have many of their elected representatives.
WASHINGTON -- In a secure facility underneath the Capitol, members of Congress stopped by all last week to review two classified annexes to the Afghan peace accord with the Taliban that set the criteria for a critical element of the agreement: What constitutes enough "peace" for the United States to withdraw its forces?
The Taliban have read the annexes. Nonetheless, the Trump administration insists that the secret documents must remain secret, though officials have struggled to explain why to skeptical lawmakers.
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, in congressional testimony, appeared unaware of -- or seemed unwilling to discuss -- the secret annexes just days before the agreement was signed. And lawmakers who have paid the most attention to the peace plan also openly express frustration with the lack of a mechanism for verifying compliance that they believe Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had promised.
At the core of the two documents, according to people familiar with their contents, is a timeline for what should happen over the next 18 months, what kinds of attacks are prohibited by both sides and, most important, how the United States will share information about its troop locations with the Taliban.
While it may sound odd that the American military is sharing troop locations with its enemy of 18 years, the goal is to give the Taliban information that would allow it to prevent attacks during the withdrawal. Mr. Pompeo described the annexes last week as "military implementation documents."
That is part of it, but they appear to be much more.
Because the documents lay out the specific understandings between the United States and the Taliban -- including what bases would remain open under Afghan control -- the details are critical to judging whether the United States is making good on its promise to leave only if conditions allow, or whether it is just getting out.
The State Department has struggled to explain why the criteria for the terms, standards and thresholds for the American withdrawal could be known to the adversary but not to the American people or allies. In response to questions from The New York Times, the State Department issued a statement on Friday saying that the documents remained classified because "the movement of troops and operations against terrorists are sensitive matters."
"We do not want, for example, ISIS to know those details," the statement added, referring to Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan.
But another reason for the secrecy, according to several people familiar with the matter, is that the annexes leave the markers for peace remarkably vague, making it far from certain that the Taliban must convert into a counterterrorism force -- as President Trump suggested a week ago -- or that they are required to make complete peace with the elected government of President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan.
In fact, as written, they appear to give Mr. Trump, or his successor, enormous latitude to simply declare that the war is over and leave. But many of Mr. Trump's aides suggest that American counterterrorism forces and a significant C.I.A. presence should remain in the country. How that will be resolved within the U.S. government, with the Taliban and with the Kabul government remains to be seen, and any resolution likely will prove difficult.
Many of the Republicans and Democrats who have taken the opportunity to review the documents say they are unimpressed.
Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican and one of the sharpest critics of the accord, said before the agreement was signed last week, "Any deal that the United States would contemplate entering into with the Taliban should be made public in its entirety."
After reading the pact, including the classified annexes, Ms. Cheney said that the deal failed to provide mechanisms to verify that the Taliban was keeping the promises that Mr. Pompeo had described at the signing. "My concerns still remain," she said, declining to describe the contents.
Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview that the thresholds outlined in the annexes were "remarkably fuzzy" and that it was unclear how the United States would measure success.
Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a senior State Department official in the Obama administration, posted a blistering message on Twitter last week about the annexes.
"Bottom line: the administration is telling a terrorist group the conditions (such as they are) of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, but not telling the American people," he wrote. "This is wrong. And it serves no national security purpose."
Lawmakers have voiced widespread unhappiness about Mr. Pompeo's outreach on the subject. He called top members on the Senate and House committees dealing with foreign affairs last weekend to give them a cursory heads-up that the documents were coming to Congress, but lawmakers and their aides said they had not heard from him since.
Days before the agreement was signed, Mr. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared to not know about -- or seemed reluctant to discuss -- the secret annexes.
"Are you aware of any contemplation of any secret side deals with the Taliban?" Ms. Cheney asked on Feb. 26 during a House Armed Services Committee meeting.
"Nothing, nothing comes to mind right now that you're mentioning," Mr. Esper replied.
"You're quoting things that I haven't seen," General Milley said.
The annexes predominantly revolve around a committee to facilitate communication between the two parties to ensure commitments are being adhered to, according to officials who have read them. No details have come to light about the composition of that committee.
They describe the parameters for when it would and would not be appropriate to use force, including commitments from the Taliban not to attack American forces during a withdrawal. Over all, the annexes make up no more than a few pages, often with just one to two sentences laying out each component. For example, the Taliban are not to conduct suicide attacks, and the Americans forgo drone strikes -- portions of the agreements that thus far have held.
General Milley hinted in congressional testimony last week what scope and scale of attacks were not permitted under the agreement.
"There is no attacks in 34 provincial capitals, there is no attacks in Kabul, there is no high-profile attacks, there is no suicide bombers, there is no vehicle-borne suicide, no attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition," General Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, after reports that the Taliban had carried out attacks against Afghan security forces. "There is a whole laundry list of these things that aren't happening."
In its statement, the State Department said the secret annexes were consistent with the public agreement. "The arrangements include specific commitments by all parties to efforts to continue to reduce violence until a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire is agreed in intra-Afghan negotiations, while preserving the right of all parties to self-defense," it said. The United States has "a robust monitoring and verification mechanism" to track and assess the behavior of the Taliban, it added.
But those who have seen the agreement said the specifics were so nebulous that they doubted the United States retained much leverage.
"The documents provided none of the assurances that I felt like we heard from Secretary Pompeo and others about a rigorous process that was going to make sure we hold the Taliban accountable for their end of the deal," said Representative Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, who served in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus.
"I saw nothing in there that gives me any confidence" that those assurances are in place "beyond trusting the word of the Taliban," he said. "This vague, thin package of documents is all we could actually get agreed to by the Taliban. I don't really understand how we can say we have what we need to be able to commit to the troop level agreements that have been articulated."
He added, "How can I meaningfully talk to my constituents about this when I'm not even allowed to share information with them that the Taliban already knows?
Mr. Murphy agreed, but noted, "That being said, I'm not sure we were ever going to get bright-line terms for the mechanisms by which the Taliban prevents extremist groups like Al Qaeda from ever returning to Afghanistan."
"I think the terms were always going to be very difficult to put down into words," he said.

Harris Is Latest Ex-Rival to Back Biden

Texto completo: Ms. Harris, who ended her own presidential campaign in December, is the latest in a parade of prominent Democrats to throw their support behind Mr. Biden.
Senator Kamala Harris of California endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president on Sunday, becoming the latest of his formal rivals for the Democratic nomination to get behind his presidential bid.
"I have decided that I am with great enthusiasm going to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States," Ms. Harris said in a video posted on Twitter. "I believe in Joe. I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time."
In a tweet, Mr. Biden expressed gratitude and invoked his late son, Beau Biden, who served as Delaware's attorney general when Ms. Harris held that post in California: "Kamala -- You've spent your whole career fighting for folks who've been written off and left behind -- and no small part of that alongside Beau. From our family: thank you."
Ms. Harris is certain to draw speculation as a potential running mate for Mr. Biden.
Ms. Harris made her endorsement after the primary race narrowed to what is effectively a two-person race between Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Moderate-leaning Democrats have rapidly coalesced behind Mr. Biden, whose campaign has been rolling out new endorsements seemingly nonstop in recent days.
In a written statement about her endorsement, Ms. Harris noted the absence of a top female candidate in the primary. "Like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one," she said, adding that "we find ourselves without any woman on a path to be the Democratic nominee for president."
"This is something we must reckon with and it is something I will have more to say about in the future," Ms. Harris said. "But we must rise to unite the party and country behind a candidate who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who can ultimately defeat Donald Trump."
Ms. Harris announced her endorsement five days after Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden captured 10 of 14 states, and ahead of another round of contests on Tuesday in six states, including Michigan. Ms. Harris will join Mr. Biden at a rally in Detroit on Monday night.
Ms. Harris ended her presidential bid in December, two months before the Iowa caucuses. Now, she is following several of her former rivals for the presidential nomination in getting behind Mr. Biden. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York left the race last week and endorsed the former vice president. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas also backed Mr. Biden last week.
Mr. Sanders pointed on Sunday to Ms. Klobuchar's and Mr. Buttigieg's decisions to drop out as the reason he lost several key states to Mr. Biden on Super Tuesday.
"The establishment put a great deal of pressure on Pete Buttigieg, on Amy Klobuchar, who ran really aggressive campaigns," he told Chuck Todd on NBC's "Meet the Press." "If they had not withdrawn from the race before Super Tuesday, which is kind of a surprise to a lot of people, I suspect we would have won in Minnesota, we would have won in Maine, we would have won in Massachusetts."
For Ms. Harris, the decision to endorse Mr. Biden is particularly striking, because one of the biggest moments of her campaign was a forceful debate-stage exchange with him.
"It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country," she said in June during the first Democratic debate.
"And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing," she added. "And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me."
The exchange gave her a lift in the polls and a temporary burst of momentum that she was not able to sustain. At a fund-raiser on Friday, Mr. Biden's wife, Jill Biden, described Ms. Harris's attack at the debate as a "punch to the gut."
Some of Ms. Harris's advisers were privately frustrated that she endorsed Mr. Biden after California voted on Super Tuesday and when it was already clear that he had become the front-runner. Some were hoping in January that she would rally to Mr. Biden at a point when her endorsement would have been more valuable -- and more politically daring.
An aide to Ms. Harris, trying to pre-empt questions about why she waited until after several other primary contenders had weighed in, said the senator wanted to give space to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Ms. Warren ended her campaign on Thursday.
Ms. Harris is facing re-election in 2022 and her allies made clear earlier this year that she did not want to alienate the left in California. Mr. Biden's advisers had hoped she would have endorsed him sooner and have made little attempt to mask their irritation at her monthslong indecision.
But the delay will not necessarily diminish her chances of being on the ticket should Mr. Biden become the nominee. The former vice president has a famously short memory for slights and, despite their bitter clash on the debate stage, he is fond of Ms. Harris.

Texto completo: We switched hotel rooms every few days so no one could track us. A Courtyard Marriott worker gave me an alias.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
At times, it seemed as if we were characters in a thriller.
Our reporting began in early 2019 with a tip about a rich Canadian playboy accused of sexually abusing poor teenage girls in the Bahamas. By the time we finally went to press last month, the story had morphed into an epic fight between ultrarich neighbors in a hall of mirrors.
Filled with lies, spies and double agents, it was the most challenging assignment of my career. (For context, I once covered Afghanistan and Pakistan. Then I decided it was possible to write a darkly comic book about the experience. Neither was simple.)
Along with the reporters Catherine Porter and Grace Ashford, I started digging into allegations against the Canadian, Peter Nygard, a fashion executive in his late 70s who had long surrounded himself with beautiful young women.
Mr. Nygard may have seemed like an eccentric has-been, with his long gray hair, low-cut V-neck shirts and obsession with stem-cell injections and cloning as ways of staving off death. But former employees and girlfriends worried about retribution from Mr. Nygard if they spoke against him. They thought of him as omnipotent, with spies everywhere.
A lawyer named Fred Smith introduced us to 11 young Bahamian women who told us that Mr. Nygard raped them as teenagers. The allegations were horrific: Some women said they were drawn to his home by the promise of luxurious parties or modeling work. Some said they were drugged. Some said he forced them to watch pornography with animals or human feces. None wanted to be identified.
Mr. Nygard has denied all these allegations.
Things got complicated quickly. We learned that Mr. Smith had worked closely with the hedge fund billionaire Louis Bacon, who happened to be Mr. Nygard's longtime nemesis and neighbor in the Bahamas. Their decade-long fight spanned courtrooms in three countries.
Mr. Nygard was behind smears declaring that Mr. Bacon belonged to the Ku Klux Klan; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Smith accused Mr. Nygard of plotting to kill them. Mr. Bacon had even moved three of Mr. Nygard's former girlfriends to the United States and hired bodyguards for them.
Given Mr. Nygard's alleged sway in the Bahamas, we were told we needed to be careful.
We switched hotels every few days so no one could track us. A Courtyard Marriott worker insisted that the hotel could not deny I was staying there if someone asked for me by name, so he disguised me as "LaKim LaBarker," a pseudonym that seemed like poor tradecraft.
One source would talk to me only in a car; as he drove us through a wooded area, he said, worryingly: "Don't worry. I'm not going to kill you." People recorded our conversations without telling us. A man with a spoofed phone number (which hid his actual location and number) called my dad, looking for me. No one ever called my dad looking for me.
Mr. Nygard actively tried to shut down the article. He filed a racketeering lawsuit against Mr. Bacon, accusing him of trying to plant a false story with The New York Times. One of his lawyers called the allegations "paid-for lies." Mr. Nygard's spokesman falsely suggested that I had taken $ 55,000 funneled through Mr. Bacon's foundation. (The so-called evidence: On a public 2016 tax return for the foundation's grants, easily printable from the internet, somebody had scrawled "--BARKER $ 55K" next to a grant for Media Matters.)
Weeks before we first hoped to publish, we doubled down on our interviews, visiting our sources to corroborate their stories and crosschecking for inconsistencies. We found that Mr. Smith and his team had spread more money around than anyone had previously told us; in particular, they had paid two women who had helped find alleged victims.
Reporting was complicated by the fact that Mr. Smith had recently nearly died in a paragliding accident in Italy, and we had to interview him as he recovered in an Italian hospital. At times, he screamed in pain.
Then a reporter's worst nightmare happened: Two accusers told us they had been lying all along. They said they had never met Mr. Nygard. They claimed they had been paid to lie -- not by Mr. Smith, not by Mr. Bacon, but by a former Nygard employee, Richette Ross, one of the two women who had helped find victims for Mr. Smith. He had paid her the equivalent of $ 86,000 a year -- for her security and to help with another lawsuit against Mr. Nygard, he claimed.
Ms. Ross passed a lie-detector test denying she had paid anyone to lie, the polygraph examiner told us. In December, her Florida lawyer sent me a cease-and-desist letter, threatening to sue if I continued talking about what we had been told.
Media organizations with fewer resources might have given up. But The Times let us continue to dig.
In the end, we put together a timeline with more than 2,000 entries from court records, books and interviews. We talked to more than 270 people, some repeatedly. And we persuaded one strong woman to go on the record: Tamika Ferguson, the only woman who said she had been raped by Mr. Nygard in the Bahamas and agreed to let us use her name.
The truth can be messy: We found that Mr. Bacon's money did help fuel the initial investigation in the Bahamas, which led to a lawsuit filed in New York last month. Those payments could be used to undermine witnesses and accusers. But we also found that Mr. Nygard, who had several homes and offices in the United States and Canada, had been accused of sexual misconduct repeatedly over the past 40 years, mainly by former employees.
Not only was that well before the feud with his neighbor, but it was also well outside the Bahamas, a country where many people asked us for money, even the government clerk who wanted $ 20 to search for a public court record. For obvious reasons, we couldn't pay a cent.

Texto completo: Scarsdale, N.Y., also announced it was closing its public schools for the week after a teacher tested positive for the virus.
Columbia University announced on Sunday night that it was canceling classes on Monday and Tuesday and that classes would be taught remotely for the rest of week after a university community member was quarantined for exposure to the new coronavirus.
In a post on the university's website, Columbia's president, Lee C. Bollinger, said it was important to note that the person had not tested positive for the virus.
"This action is intended to prevent the virus from spreading," Mr. Bollinger said.
Mr. Bollinger did not say whether the person was a student or a faculty member, or how the person had been exposed to the virus.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of coronavirus cases rose. As of Sunday night, more than 100 people in New York State had tested positive for the virus, according to state and local health officials, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Barnard College, which is considered one of Columbia's four undergraduate colleges but is an independent institution, announced that it was taking the same precautions. In a post on Barnard's website, the college's president, Sian Leah Beilock, characterized the person's exposure as an isolated case.
The cancellations coincide with midterm examinations for many students, which Ms. Beilock said she had asked to be suspended or given in a take-home format.
"It is important to know that our actions are out of an abundance of caution," she said.
Students at Columbia and Barnard College won't return to the classroom for two weeks because spring recess is next week. In 2019, there were 33,413 total students and 4,364 total faculty members at Columbia, according to the university's website. At Barnard, there were 2,682 undergraduate students and 253 full-time faculty members as of the fall.
Kelly Fuller, a freshman at Barnard who is currently taking a global health class, said it was difficult to say whether canceling classes was the best decision, but "I'm glad they're doing something."
"When we got the email, it was like, thank you, yeah, that's what I wanted," she said. "You're recognizing that it's important for us to not get sick."
Maya Perry, 22, called it a "sensible" decision, but all of her classes at Columbia this semester were small-group seminars, like a 12-person class on American cultural criticism that she worried might not work as well online.
"I was looking forward to a particular class discussion on Tuesday, but obviously safety is more important than that," she said.
Ms. Beilock said that residence halls, libraries and other university buildings would remain open, but that all events and gatherings had been canceled, in addition to admissions tours. She said the university had consulted with city and state health officials on the plan.
"We all share the goal of upholding the health and safety of our community," she said, "and we ask for your consideration and caring of each other during this difficult time."
The precautionary measures taken by Columbia and Barnard came as public school administrators in one town in Westchester County, N.Y., announced on Sunday that a middle school teacher had tested positive for the virus and that classes had been canceled for the week at all public schools there.
The town, Scarsdale, which is about 25 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, was following the recommendation of the Westchester County health commissioner, school officials said in a post on the district's website.
They said the teacher was showing mild symptoms of the illness and that the school district wanted to be vigilant for "immuno-compromised" people.
The school system said it was working with health officials to contact families of students who had been exposed to the teacher. All school buildings will be disinfected, the post on the district's website said.
"We recognize that this news will be concerning to many of our students and families," the post said.
In New Canaan, Conn., public school officials announced on Sunday that classes would be delayed two hours on Monday so teachers could organize materials for students to take home with them in case the schools close because of the coronavirus.
Ned Lamont, Connecticut's governor, announced on Sunday that a resident of Wilton, Conn., which neighbors New Canaan, had become the first state resident to test positive for the virus. The person, who the governor said was between 40 and 50 years old and had recently traveled to California, was being treated at Danbury Hospital.
A New York resident who is an employee of Danbury Hospital and Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut also tested positive for the coronavirus, Mr. Lamont said on Friday.

'Changing Situation' in Tokyo Planning, Doctor Says

Texto completo: Though the Summer Games in Tokyo are expected to go on as scheduled, "it is a dynamically changing situation," said Jonathan Finnoff, the new chief medical officer for Team U.S.A.
Jonathan Finnoff became the chief medical officer of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee in January, taking on a job that typically focuses on the sports-related injuries and risks of athletes who represent the country at international competitions.
Lately, though, his job has been primarily about the coronavirus and the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where competition is scheduled to begin on July 22. Stakeholders in the Games -- athletes, coaches, sponsors, fans who have bought tickets -- want to know what to expect, what the risks are of athletic competition, even whether to avoid the customary postgame handshake with an opponent.
Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, said last week that plans were continuing for the Games to go on as scheduled, and for now Dr. Finnoff has offered largely common sense advice: Wash your hands often. Avoid contact with someone exhibiting symptoms. Hand sanitizer and disinfectants can help.
The chief medical officers for all of the national Olympic committees plan to meet in Monaco later this month. They will have plenty to discuss.
Dr. Finnoff has more than two decades of experience in treating sports injuries, and served as medical director for the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center in Minneapolis, where he has been a team physician for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx since 2014.
In an interview Friday with The New York Times, Dr. Finnoff spoke about the effect of the coronavirus on sports events and other mass gatherings and said that the U.S.O.P.C. had no reason to believe the Olympics wouldn't happen this summer in Tokyo but that things could change quickly.
"It is a dynamically changing situation," he said. "Two weeks ago there were no issues with travel to Italy, and now there are a significant number of cases in northern Italy."
This interview was condensed and edited for clarity:
You are obviously getting plenty of questions about what will happen and what people should do in preparation for the Olympics or whether there will even be an Olympics. What do you tell them?
We are in constant contact with local governments, state governments, national governments and governing bodies and the World Health Organization. The last pandemic was in 2009, and there have been pandemics before the Olympics. We had H1N1 before Vancouver in 2010 and the issues with Zika before Rio. This is not new, but each situation is different. We are getting a lot of inquiries. There is no indication that the Games are not going to occur, but I tell them to listen to the appropriate recommendations in terms of safety.
What are those recommendations?
Try not to touch your face. Wash your hands frequently. Stay three feet away from someone coughing. If you have symptoms that include a fever, cough or fatigue, and if you have been in a high risk area, reach out to a local health authority. Check the Centers for Disease Control for travel recommendations.
Athletes tend to be younger than the general population. The people who seem to be in the most danger from this virus are older and in compromised health. Could there be a shift that makes younger, healthier people more vulnerable?
The epidemiology won't change. It probably will affect the older rather than the young population. It has affected enough people for us to see who is at risk.
Sports are trying to adjust by doing things like banning traditional handshakes . Does that make a difference given all the contact people experience when they play sports?
We have found it very unlikely that this is contagious when someone is asymptomatic. So if the people playing a sport are asymptomatic, then the likelihood of spreading the disease is extremely low.
Every night there are professional sports events that qualify as mass gatherings. Do those events, whether they are N.B.A. games or road races, present a danger?
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines for mass gatherings. They aren't saying don't have these events, but do so with precautions. There is no such thing as zero risk, and the risk is based on prevalence of disease in an area. If you are in a place where there is a high number of people infected, then even if it's a small gathering, the risk is higher. Studies that have been done in China indicate that the area where the greatest transmission has occurred is at home, because you've had close and frequent contact with someone who is infected.
We have MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and yet we still have the large event known as the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. They try to mitigate the spread through education about social distancing, not shaking hands and avoiding touching the face.
Is an indoor mass event more dangerous than an outdoor one?
Intuitively, you would say an outdoor event has more potential for social distancing and the air moving, so that might reduce the risk. Indoors, if you are in close quarters, you may be next to someone who is sick. But to my knowledge, there is not a specific study that describes the difference between the two with coronavirus.
What misconceptions exist about this virus?
There is misinformation about when people are infectious. In flu, there is a period where you are contagious before you are symptomatic. With this, that does not appear to be the case. Coronavirus appears to be contagious primarily when you are symptomatic.
Is it safe to use equipment at a gym?
In areas where there is significant contact with surfaces, particularly in an area with coronavirus, then if you are touching the surfaces you want to mitigate risk. If you are touching something other people have touched, don't touch your face immediately after. Use hand sanitizer that has 60 percent alcohol content. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Wipe down equipment at the gym. It's always a good idea for healthy hygiene to wipe it down before and after use.
People talk about the Olympic Games as a petri dish and a perfect vehicle for spreading illness worldwide. Is that fair?
If there was an unknown, emerging disease, and we were not prepared for it and not taking precautions, and you brought people from all over the world in close contact and not taking precautions, then I would agree that any mass gathering like that would have potential to spread disease. But the I.OC. and the W.H.O. and the local organizing committee are doing a great job working with the public health system to prepare not only athletes but staff and people coming to give them information.

Texto completo: Some of his paintings were of shimmering forests. Others were of disarranged body parts.
Alan Turner, who drew on Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism and more in acclaimed paintings and drawings that could be humorous, disturbing or poignant, died on Feb. 8 at his loft in Lower Manhattan. He was 76.
The poet Lee Briccetti, his partner of almost 20 years, said the cause was progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative brain disorder. He had been in home hospice care for some years.
Mr. Turner's art was widely exhibited and wide ranging. In the late 1970s he produced mesmerizing paintings of trees "that seemed to square off like fighters or wrap themselves around one another in a claustrophobic embrace," as Michael Brenson put it in a review in The New York Times.
Then came works featuring humanoid figures and faces, the eyes, ears and other body parts distorted or bizarrely placed. "Several noses cohabit on a single torso," Grace Glueck wrote in The Times in 2000, describing an exhibition at the Lennon, Weinberg gallery in SoHo, "an eye doubles as a nose, and a vaginal cleft seams the long flat chin of a grotesque monster face."
In recent years, spurred by cardboard shelters in the homeless encampments along the Tiber River that he saw on his frequent trips to Rome, he developed a "Box House" series, mostly in graphite, that explored not only those but all sorts of boxes that harbor all sorts of things, whether people, pets or memories.
And there was work that fit into none of those groupings -- for instance, "Proper Breeding" (1975), now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art. It's a very realistic depiction of a dachshund. Except that the dog is blue and has six legs.
Alan Lee Turner was born on July 6, 1943, in the Bronx. "I was to be named after my father's father," he wrote in an autobiographical sketch in the catalog for a 2018 retrospective at the Parker Gallery in Los Angeles, "but his name had been Adolph, which did not seem a good name for a Jewish boy to be brought up in the Bronx in 1943."
His father, Louis, operated the projector at the Lane movie theater in Washington Heights in Manhattan, and his mother, Rose (Taylor) Turner, worked at Stern's department store.
Mr. Turner enrolled at City College, where he was on the fencing team. He started out as a mathematics major but changed to art, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1965. He then earned a master's degree at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1967. The artist David Hockney was among his teachers.
"From David Hockney I learned to work from background to foreground in a painting," Mr. Turner told Dan Nadel, who curated the Parker Gallery show and interviewed him for the catalog in 2017.
In 1968, when Mr. Turner was looking to avoid the draft, Mr. Hockney offered him the use of a vacant apartment he had in London. Mr. Turner later moved to an abandoned factory in London, where two other artists were living.
He sneaked back into the United States briefly in 1970 to visit his mother, who was ill, and in 1972 he returned to the United States for good. In the autobiographical sketch, he said he believed he wasn't prosecuted for draft dodging because his draft record had been among those destroyed by protesters who had entered or broke into various draft board offices in the late 1960s and burned documents.
Mr. Turner had his first solo show in Cologne, Germany, in 1971. His first New York show was in 1975 at the Carl Solway Gallery, where John Russell, reviewing it in The Times, found his work striking.
"They are quite small pictures, neatly and carefully painted," he wrote, "with something of Magritte in the soundless and airless look of the environment; but they also have a slow-burning, guarded quality that is Mr. Turner's own. Sometimes they are very funny; but our laughter seems to die in the air, and a shiver takes its place."
His paintings of jumbled human figures and body parts drew particular attention.
"These paintings," Mr. Brenson wrote of an exhibition of seven works at the Koury Wingate Gallery in SoHo in 1988, "have been swept along by an artistic decade caught between a stormy insistence on the body and a stormy insistence on the mind. The result is a perverse, witty and uningratiating pictorial world in which sadomasochism is inevitable and trust has been beached on the sand."
Were such works intended to be unsettling?
"I never meant to scare people," Mr. Turner told Mr. Nadel. "If they were scared or put off, it had to do with the nature of who they were."
Before his illness, Mr. Turner was a dedicated runner, completing 16 marathons. In the 1993 New York City Marathon he finished third in the 50-to-54 age group.
In addition to Ms. Briccetti, he is survived by a sister, Sandra Turner.
In the interview with Mr. Nadel, Mr. Turner talked about the unconscious and barely conscious influences that went into creating his art, and into appreciating it.
"I had a collector who bought a painting," he said. "He woke up in the middle of the night with only a view of his wife's armpit. After that, he said he understood my work."

Texto completo: "Onward" brought in an estimated $ 40 million in domestic ticket sales, a relatively weak opening by Pixar standards.
In "Onward," the latest animated feature from Pixar, two elf brothers cast a magic spell that half-succeeds: They bring their dead father back to life, but only from the waist down, as a pair of sentient pants and shoes.
At the box office this weekend, the movie was met with similarly mixed success.
"Onward" opened to an estimated $ 40 million in domestic ticket sales Friday through Sunday, more than enough for first place, but it's relatively weak for a Pixar movie. For comparison, Pixar's "Inside Out" opened to roughly $ 98 million in domestic sales in June 2015, adjusting for inflation. The studio released "Onward" unusually early in the year; it typically puts out movies around summer or during the holiday season.
The plot of "Onward" revolves around the brothers' quest to fully reincarnate their father. (The siblings are voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt.) The quest takes them on a tour through their universe, which is populated by fantasy creatures (like elves and dragons) who have largely given up magic in favor of technology. (Octavia Spencer voices a manticore who runs a restaurant; Julia Louis-Dreyfus voices the boys' mother.)
"Onward," directed by Dan Scanlon ("Monsters University"), holds an 86 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but that good reception is modest by Pixar standards: The studio's past three movies ("Toy Story 4," "Incredibles 2" and "Coco") all have Rotten Tomatoes scores of 94 or above. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the movie's central journey "plays as disappointingly routine, a checklist of mechanically foreshadowed heart-to-hearts and lessons learned, leavened by the occasional offbeat sight gag."

Second place went to Universal's "The Invisible Man," a rethink of the H.G. Wells horror story that led the box office last weekend and sold an additional estimated $ 15.2 million in tickets this weekend. "The Invisible Man," which stars Elisabeth Moss, has now made around $ 52.7 million total on domestic screens -- a strong success given that the movie cost just $ 8 million to make.
The only newcomer in the top five this weekend besides "Onward" was "The Way Back" (Warner Bros.), a sports drama starring Ben Affleck that opened to a solid estimated $ 8.5 million and landed in third place. Paramount's "Sonic the Hedgehog" took fourth with an estimated $ 8 million in sales according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. "The Call of the Wild" (20th Century Studios) rounded out the top five, with an estimated $ 7 million in domestic sales.

Texto completo: Investors and clients of the facial recognition start-up freely used the app on dates and at parties -- and to spy on the public.
One Tuesday night in October 2018, John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery store chain, was having dinner at Cipriani, an upscale Italian restaurant in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, when his daughter, Andrea, walked in. She was on a date with a man Mr. Catsimatidis didn't recognize. After the couple sat down at another table, Mr. Catsimatidis asked a waiter to go over and take a photo.
Mr. Catsimatidis then uploaded the picture to a facial recognition app, Clearview AI, on his phone. The start-up behind the app has a database of billions of photos, scraped from sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Within seconds, Mr. Catsimatidis was viewing a collection of photos of the mystery man, along with the web addresses where they appeared: His daughter's date was a venture capitalist from San Francisco.
"I wanted to make sure he wasn't a charlatan," said Mr. Catsimatidis, who then texted the man's bio to his daughter.
Ms. Catsimatidis said she and her date had no idea how her father had identified him so quickly. "I expect my dad to be able to do crazy things. He's very technologically savvy," Ms. Catsimatidis said. "My date was very surprised."
Clearview was unknown to the general public until this January, when The New York Times reported that the secretive start-up had developed a breakthrough facial recognition system that was in use by hundreds of law enforcement agencies. The company quickly faced a backlash on multiple fronts. Facebook, Google and other tech giants sent cease-and-desist letters. Lawsuits were filed in Illinois and Virginia, and the attorney general of New Jersey issued a moratorium against the app in that state.
In response to the criticism, Clearview published a "code of conduct," emphasizing in a blog post that its technology was "available only for law enforcement agencies and select security professionals to use as an investigative tool."
The post added: "We recognize that powerful tools always have the potential to be abused, regardless of who is using them, and we take the threat very seriously. Accordingly, the Clearview app has built-in safeguards to ensure these trained professionals only use it for its intended purpose: to help identify the perpetrators and victims of crimes."
The Times, however, has identified multiple individuals with active access to Clearview's technology who are not law enforcement officials. And for more than a year before the company became the subject of public scrutiny, the app had been freely used in the wild by the company's investors, clients and friends.
Those with Clearview logins used facial recognition at parties, on dates and at business gatherings, giving demonstrations of its power for fun or using it to identify people whose names they didn't know or couldn't recall.
"As part of the ordinary course of due diligence, we provided trial accounts to potential and current investors, and other strategic partners, so they could test the technology," said Hoan Ton-That, the company's co-founder.
Mr. Catsimatidis first heard about Clearview from his friend Richard Schwartz, another founder of the company, who served as an aide to Rudolph W. Giuliani when Mr. Giuliani was mayor of New York. Last summer, Mr. Catsimatidis ran a trial project with Clearview at an East Side Gristedes market. The company used the system to identify known "shoplifters or people who had held up other stores," Mr. Catsimatidis said.
"People were stealing our Häagen-Dazs. It was a big problem," he said. He described Clearview as a "good system" that helped security personnel identify problem shoppers.
BuzzFeed News has reported that two other entities, a labor union and a real estate firm, also ran trials with a surveillance system developed by Clearview to flag individuals they deemed risky. The publication also reported that Clearview's software has been used by Best Buy, Macy's, Kohl's, the National Basketball Association and numerous other organizations.
When Clearview first developed its facial recognition service in 2017, Mr. Ton-That and Mr. Schwartz were uncertain about who might pay for it, and they courted a range of clients including real estate firms, banks and retailers. At the same time, Clearview was seeking outside investment. Many of the individuals the company approached got personal logins to the app. Clearview received a seed investment round of about $ 1 million in July 2018. Its backers included the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist David Scalzo and Hal Lambert, an investor in Texas who runs an exchange-traded fund with the ticker symbol "MAGA," which tracks companies that align with Republican politics.
"I have the app," Mr. Lambert said in an interview. "I've used it to talk about what we're doing in the space. I show it to friends of mine, potential investors.
"They thought it was amazing," he added. "They say, 'How do I get that?' And I say, 'You can't."'
Mr. Scalzo, the founder of the investment firm Kirenaga Partners, said in an interview that his school-aged daughters enjoyed playing with the app.
"They like to use it on themselves and their friends to see who they look like in the world," he said. "It's kind of fun for people."
A spokesman for Mr. Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.
When Clearview was seeking its Series A round of funding, which was completed in 2019, the start-up contacted a number of venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures. Access to the app was offered as a perk, according to people familiar with the company's fund-raising attempts.
Doug Leone, a billionaire partner at Sequoia, was given a login, according to three people with knowledge of Clearview's operations. But his account was revoked when Sequoia declined to invest. A spokeswoman for Sequoia declined to comment.
In September, Ashton Kutcher, the actor turned venture capitalist, described an app much like Clearview during a YouTube series called "Hot Ones," in which guests are interviewed while eating spicy chicken wings.
"I have an app in my phone in my pocket right now. It's like a beta app," Mr. Kutcher said. "It's a facial recognition app. I can hold it up to anybody's face here and, like, find exactly who you are, what internet accounts you're on, what they look like. It's terrifying."
Mr. Kutcher did not respond to a request for comment.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Ton-That contends that Clearview is doing nothing wrong -- that his app simply replicates what other search engines do. Instead of allowing internet users to search for people's public images by name, as one can do on Google, he said, Clearview allows them to do the search by uploading a face.
For now, it's a power that Clearview controls and can give out as it pleases.
In October, Clearview asked Nicholas Cassimatis, an expert on artificial intelligence, to help conduct an internal accuracy test. He did the work for free, he said, because he knew Mr. Ton-That socially. The test consisted of submitting the faces of 834 federal and state legislators. Clearview's algorithms accurately identified every one of the politicians.
After the test was complete, Mr. Cassimatis was allowed to keep Clearview's app on his phone. He said he had since run dozens of searches.
"I tested it in surprising places: smoky bars, dark places. And it worked every time," Mr. Cassimatis said. "It's road testing. I do it as a hobby. I ask people for permission. It's like a parlor trick. People like it."
Erin Griffith contributed reporting. Susan Beachy contributed research.

Texto completo: A paradox of Jewish fragility and heroism.
A perplexing paradox lies at the heart of Purim, the holiday celebrated this week by Jews around the world. No day is more associated with Jewish joy; yet rightly understood the scriptural source of our celebration -- the biblical book of Esther -- proclaims a terrifying teaching.
Let us briefly review the plot. The Persian king Ahasuerus -- the character in the Bible most akin to Henry VIII -- is overcome by drunken rage and rids himself of his wife. In a contest eerily akin to reality shows today, he conducts a search for a new queen, ultimately choosing a beautiful Jewish woman named Esther, who is advised by her cousin Mordecai not to disclose her religious identity. Haman, the high-ranking minister to Ahasuerus, convinces the king to decree a genocide of the Jews. Urged into action by her cousin, Esther plays on the king's paranoia, engaging in court intrigue to turn him against Haman, who is hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. At Esther's initiative, and with Ahasuerus' encouragement, Jews across the empire wage war against Haman's allies, and Mordecai is given the political position once held by Haman. The central ritual of Purim is the reading of this biblical book aloud in synagogue as a celebration of Jewish salvation and the defeat of anti-Semitism.
Yet as the final words are read, and joyous song erupts in the sanctuary, the careful reader realizes that the security of Persian Jewry, and of Mordecai and Esther, is anything other than assured, and that even the swift nature of Haman's fall is a reflection of terrifying political instability. In such a society, with such an unbalanced and capricious king, could not another Haman easily arise?
The disquieting conclusion of Esther's tale was eloquently described by my great-uncle, Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik. "If a prime minister who just yesterday enjoyed the full confidence and trust of the king was suddenly convicted and executed," he reflected, "then who is wise and clairvoyant enough to assure us that the same unreasonable, absurd, neurotic change of mood and mind will not repeat itself?" The Purim tale reminds us that a government, and the society it oversees, can turn against its most vulnerable in a matter of moments. This is why, he argued, Esther's story is no triumphal tale; on the contrary, it is "the book of the vulnerability of man in general and specifically of the vulnerability of the Jew."
That it was Rabbi Soloveitchik who understood this isn't a coincidence. As a young man in the 1920s, he had traveled from Eastern Europe to study philosophy in the University of Berlin. The city was then a center of Jewish intellectual and cultural achievement; Rabbi Soloveitchik would have met coreligionists who saw themselves as both German and Jewish, who had served the kaiser in the First World War and were patriotically committed to their country's future. They would have spoken of the Enlightenment, and progress, and religious acceptance in their society. Then that very same society embraced a Haman-figure, and the lives Jews knew in Europe disappeared forever. Small wonder, then, that a rabbi who escaped this inferno would recognize the frightening implications of Jewish vulnerability inherent in Esther's tale.
Why, then, is Purim marked as a holiday? If the conclusion of Esther is more nerve-racking than is often thought, what is the source of our joy? The answer, in part, is that it is this very vulnerability that makes Jewish heroism possible, and that is why, on Purim, we focus on the woman that gave this biblical book her name: it is Esther whom we celebrate. Precisely because of the constancy of Jewish vulnerability, we glorify Esther's initiative, courage, and wisdom to inculcate these same virtues in our posterity.
Here we must understand how different the Book of Esther is from every other book in the Hebrew Bible. In this tale no mention is made of the divine; the Jews inhabit a world devoid of revelation. Whereas in every other scriptural tale political engagements are under prophetic instruction, in the Persian court God gives no guidance to the Jews facing a terrible danger. Esther, Rabbi Soloveitchik wrote, faced an unprecedented question: "How can the Jew triumph over his adversaries and enemies if God has stopped speaking to him, if the cryptic messages he receives remain unintelligible and incomprehensible?"
In this sense, Esther is the first biblical figure, male or female, to engage in statesmanship. Previous heroes -- Moses and Elijah, Samuel and Deborah -- are prophets who are guided and guarded by the Divine, but Esther operates on instinct, reflecting a mastery of realpolitik. As Isaiah Berlin wrote in his essay "On Political Judgment," great leaders practice affairs of state not as a science but an art; they are, more akin to orchestra conductors than chemists. Facing a crisis, they "grasp the unique combination of characteristics that constitute this particular situation -- this and no other." Esther is the first scriptural figure to embody this description, emerging as a woman for all seasons, a hero celebrated year after year.
Purim thus marks the fragility of Jewish security, but also the possibility of heroism in the face of this vulnerability. It is therefore a holiday for our time. Around the world, and especially in a Europe that should know better, anti-Semitism has made itself manifest once again. As Esther's example is celebrated, and Jews gather in synagogue to study her terrifying tale, we are reminded why, in the face of hate, we remain vigilant -- and why we continue to joyously celebrate all the same.

Texto completo: The warning was another indication of the Trump administration's increasingly cautious approach to the coronavirus, and another instance of an apparent gap between the president and health officials.
The State Department on Sunday advised Americans against traveling on cruise ships, warning that they presented a higher risk of coronavirus infection and made U.S. citizens vulnerable to possible international travel restrictions, including quarantines.
The decision came after President Trump resisted requests from administration officials to publicly urge older travelers to avoid cruise ships and plane travel, saying he thought it would harm those industries, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
"U.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship," the State Department wrote in an alert posted to its website Sunday.
Americans should not rely on being evacuated if other countries subject them to quarantine, the department said.
The guidance signaled another escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to ward off the fast-growing spread of the virus, and another instance of what appeared to be separation between health officials and the president, who has repeatedly registered skepticism over making statements he believes are alarmist.
It came as federal and state officials scrambled to contain a cluster of cases on the 3,500-passenger Grand Princess, which has idled off the coast of California. Twenty-one people onboard tested positive for the coronavirus, and it was on its way to dock on Monday at the Port of Oakland, the vessel's operator said.
The decision to caution Americans capped weeks of discussions on the Trump administration's interagency task force about how to communicate alarm about cruise ships after hundreds of Americans, including some who tested positive for the virus, were evacuated from the Diamond Princess off the coast of Japan, a process rife with confusion and disorder.
It was Vice President Mike Pence, who is overseeing the federal government's coronavirus efforts, who signed off on the State Department's announcement and Stephen E. Biegun, the deputy secretary of state and another task force member, who formalized it, a senior official familiar with the decision said. The final call on Sunday did not reach Mr. Trump's level, the official said.
The White House did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The State Department guidance came a day after Mr. Pence held a meeting with cruise ship industry officials about what, if anything, the federal government might do. Some executives were surprised to see the department's warning after it emerged. One senior administration official familiar with what was said at the meeting said industry officials seemed to be looking for the federal government to take action as opposed to cruise ship companies instituting their own more rigorous policies.
According to an official with knowledge of the task force talks, at least four members of the group pushed for the State Department to caution Americans against cruises: Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert P. Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response; and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the new coronavirus response coordinator.
The talks picked up last week as the Grand Princess waited for a confirmation of possible infections on the ship. A 71-year-old man died after traveling on a previous leg of the cruise, a round trip from San Francisco to Mexico. Another passenger from that leg of the trip also tested positive for the virus and is being treated in California.
After the Grand Princess docks, those aboard will be taken to military facilities around the country to be tested and quarantined for 14 days, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
About 1,000 passengers who are California residents will go to Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., or the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. Residents of other states will be taken to Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas or Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Ga.
More than 500 coronavirus infections have been confirmed by lab tests in the United States as of Sunday, and 22 people have died so far from them.
"This is a fluid situation," the State Department notice said, adding that the C.D.C. recommends that older adults, in addition to those with underlying health problems, should avoid any setting that makes them more vulnerable to disease.
"This entails avoiding crowded places, avoiding nonessential travel such as long plane trips, and especially avoiding embarking on cruise ships," the alert said.
In response to the State Department, Carnival Corporation said in a statement on Sunday that its brands, which include Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Cunard, enhanced its health screening protocols to include thermal scans and temperature checks before boarding and onboard.
"We are currently in discussions with the C.D.C., World Health Organization and other health officials," the statement said, noting that the cruise industry committed to an aggressive response plan when it met with Mr. Pence on Saturday. "The health and safety of our guests and crew is our highest priority, and cruising remains one of the most attractive vacation options available."
On Sunday morning, Dr. Fauci appeared to preview the State Department's announcement, saying on "Fox News Sunday" that older Americans in poor health need to avoid large crowds and plane travel.
"Absolutely don't get on a cruise ship," he said.

Texto completo: Ahead of his ninth season, Newgarden dug in on downforce, Derek Jeter and going shirtless on "American Ninja Warrior."
At 29, Josef Newgarden, already a two-time IndyCar champion, is readying for his ninth season in the sport. But Newgarden, a Nashville native, will tell you that winning the Indy 500, where his best finish so far is third, is what he most wants to achieve.
With the IndyCar season starting up later this month, Newgarden sat down with New York Times reporters to talk downforce, Derek Jeter and taking off his shirt on "America Ninja Warrior."
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Let's start with the basics. What does it feel like to be in a racecar going at top speed?
There's a perception problem. Most people think they can imagine what driving a racecar is like. But driving a Chevy Malibu at 60 miles an hour on the highway is completely removed from driving an IndyCar at 240 miles an hour.
It is a much more intense experience. It's like bolting yourself to a jet fighter plane. The acceleration, the deceleration, the lateral movement, those are very akin to a roller coaster.
And then you have the physical toll. There's no power steering; nothing's power assisted whatsoever, so the comforts that you're used to on a standard road car: That's gone. There's no supple suspension to help you absorb the imperfections of road conditions. All of that gets directly shot into your body.
Is weight training and conditioning important, then?
I'm a big rower. It's very taxing cardio-wise, and it's full body and core muscular movement. I also lift weights to build muscle mass, and we do a lot of circuit training to turn that into endurance. And we do cardiovascular-specific exercises to create that good cardio base.
You got your start in go-kart racing. How old were you?
I was 13. I wanted to do it since I was 3, 4 years old. There's not a lot of outlets for that in Nashville. It took until I was 13 to convince my dad to find a competitive go-kart track. The closest place was 300 miles away up in Indianapolis.
Karting is very good for learning those early basic principles of how to race.
How fast do those karts go?
The little kids, 3, 4 years old, go 25 to 30 miles an hour. The karts that I drove when I was 13, those went about 60.
You're a newlywed. Should you have children, and they are interested, would you have any qualms letting them kart?
If it was their passion, I would support it 100 percent. I think I would not push them. It's a difficult sport, a very sponsor-based sport. Baseball, football, basketball cost a lot less money. Someone's got to pay for the kart, the fuel, the tires, the mechanic. That only gets worse the higher you go up the ladder. I would hope they could get into a more cost-effective sport.
You were on "American Ninja Warrior."
It went so-so. I got the opportunity about a week and a half before. What are you going to say? No? I had no time to prepare.
It's not so much that you have to be physically prepared. But you really need to understand the technique. Where I failed was at the third obstacle. I didn't understand how to swing myself on these pendulum devices. It wasn't that I didn't have the core, it's that I didn't know how to do it.
You show up, they show it to you, then you get one attempt. You get no practice run.
Halfway through, you took your shirt off. Why?
My strategy was to stick to the log roll, a rubber matted log. My skin is going to be stickier to stick to that. I have more of a chance to hang on. It worked; I got through that one.
You're a Yankees fan. How did that come about?
I was a baseball player growing up. They're so iconic. I liked the brand, even as a kid. The N.Y. symbol. Then I became a Derek Jeter fan. I loved the way he represented the Yankees. I respect dynasties that continue to find success. Sustaining success in sports is so, so tough. That is what I want to do. I want to figure out how to win the most championships of anybody. I want to set records.
Jeter never changed his approach. In the postseason, everyone else got tight and uncomfortable and tried to do something extra. He was the same.
I like that. People always ask us, what about the Indy 500? What do you have to do different to win it? For me, that's what I haven't achieved yet. Really, at the end of the day, you shouldn't change. If you do, you set yourself up for failure. You can't turn the event into this monstrosity in your head; it has to be treated as a normal race.
How is Indy as a track?
It's four 90-degree corners. So it's not a true oval, more like a rectangle. Every corner -- they look identical. But they're all slightly different.
And the wind really comes into play. You're constantly looking at the flags and the windsocks. It affects the car so dramatically, corner to corner. If I'm heading into Turn 1 and the wind's behind me, I know the car's probably going to want to push to the wall. But now in Turn 3 the wind's heading toward me, so the front's probably going to want to turn way too much. And then you have the crosswind. It's always moving, every lap.
At Indy, it's really heightened how much you have to be on the ball.
Hard-core fans like to debate "downforce." Can you explain that, and are you happy with the current level of downforce in IndyCars?
A jet is designed to go up in the air and create lift. The IndyCar does the opposite. It's got wings, but they're turned the other way, and they push the car into the ground.
What you don't want is to have it produce too much downforce. That makes it easier to drive. It's like a Band-Aid for bad drivers. The less downforce you have on the car, the more tricky and challenging it is. If you think you're the best driver out there, you want to make the car as difficult to drive as possible.
Right now, in IndyCar, we've taken a lot of the downforce away. The cars have become a lot more lively. I think it's perfect, actually.
When you drive, or before races, do you think or worry about wrecking?
You can't go into the race thinking, "How do I not wreck?" You're not going to drive the car at 100 percent of the limit that it has to be driven at to win. You can't think about the what-if.
Every now and then, you're going to step over the limit of the car, and you're going to wreck it. You kind of have to sometimes; it's healthy to do that. To understand what the limit of the car is.
Do you ever think of trying Formula One or any other racing series?
Yeah, definitely. When I was 17, I got to go to Europe. I wanted to stay over there and try for Formula One. I did really well, but then ran out of money after my second year.
Formula One is very glitzy and glamorous, but if you're not in a Ferrari or a Mercedes you might as well not show up. There's zero chance you're going to win the race. That's demoralizing.
I'd like to do it. But nowadays, it's kind of hard for any American. There's a Formula One bubble in Europe. I'll be honest, they look down on Americans a bit over there. It's really silly. There's American talent that if they got the right seat at the right time, they could win championships, no problem.
When you drive on the streets, do you speed?
I don't, actually. I drive a bit like a grandma. I'm driving a Tahoe half the time. It's not built to be driven quick. I have had one speeding ticket.
Did the cop say, "Who do you think you are, Mario Andretti?"
That happened to Mario once! Mario is the coolest. He's 80. He's got the most swagger in the pit lane. He gets cooler the older he is.

Misinformation Surge on Coronavirus Stumps Facebook and Twitter

Texto completo: Secret labs. Magic cures. Government plots. Despite efforts by social media companies to stop it, false information about the coronavirus is proliferating around the world.
SAN FRANCISCO -- First, there were conspiratorial whispers on social media that the coronavirus had been cooked up in a secret government lab in China. Then there were bogus medicines: gels, liquids and powders that immunized against the virus.
And then there were the false claims about governments and celebrities and racial unrest. Taiwan was covering up virus deaths, and the illness was spiraling out of control. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who now runs a philanthropic organization, was behind the spread of the virus. Italians were marching in the streets, accusing Chinese people of bringing the illness to their country. None of it was true.
As the coronavirus has spread across the world, so too has misinformation about it, despite an aggressive effort by social media companies to prevent its dissemination. Facebook, Google and Twitter said they were removing misinformation about the coronavirus as fast as they could find it, and were working with the World Health Organization and other government organizations to ensure that people got accurate information.
But a search by The New York Times found dozens of videos, photographs and written posts on each of the social media platforms that appeared to have slipped through the cracks. The posts were not limited to English. Many were originally in languages ranging from Hindi and Urdu to Hebrew and Farsi, reflecting the trajectory of the virus as it has traveled around the world.
Security researchers have even found that hackers were setting up threadbare websites that claimed to have information about the coronavirus. The sites were actually digital traps, aimed at stealing personal data or breaking into the devices of people who landed on them.
The spread of false and malicious content about the coronavirus has been a stark reminder of the uphill battle fought by researchers and internet companies. Even when the companies are determined to protect the truth, they are often outgunned and outwitted by the internet's liars and thieves.
There is so much inaccurate information about the virus, the W.H.O. has said it was confronting a "infodemic."
"I see misinformation about the coronavirus everywhere. Some people are panicking, and looking to magical cures, and other people are spreading conspiracies," said Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist at Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
In Taiwan, virus-related misinformation on social media has fed concerns that China might be using the crisis to undermine the government of the self-ruling island.
In recent weeks, there have been posts on Facebook and other sites claiming that Taiwan has concealed large numbers of coronavirus infections. There have been fake but official-looking documents promising giveaways of face masks and vaccines. A screen capture from a television news broadcast was doctored to say that President Tsai Ing-wen had contracted the disease and was in quarantine.
In a statement to The Times, Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, blamed China's "internet armies" for the deluge of falsehoods, though his office declined to elaborate on how he came to that conclusion. China's Taiwan Affairs Office didn't respond to a faxed request for comment.
The Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of China's territory, and Taiwanese officials have long accused Beijing of manipulating both traditional news media and social platforms to turn Taiwanese citizens against President Tsai, who opposes closer ties with China.
Summer Chen, the editor in chief of Taiwan FactCheck Center, a watchdog group that debunks online rumors and hoaxes, said her team had been busier since the outbreak began than it was ahead of Taiwan's presidential election in January, when the island was on high alert for potential Chinese meddling.
"Throughout this whole epidemic, people have really liked conspiracy theories," Ms. Chen said. "Why is it that during epidemics people don't choose to believe accurate scientific information?"
Facebook, YouTube and Twitter all said they were making efforts to point people back to reliable sources of medical information, and had direct lines of communication to the W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Facebook said it bans content that could cause people harm, such as claims that discourage treatment or taking appropriate precautions against the coronavirus. Posts and videos that shared conspiracy theories were clearly marked as false, once they had been reviewed by fact checkers.
When Facebook users attempt to share them, a message pops up alerting the user that the post includes information that has been deemed false by fact checkers.
Those measures, however, have not stopped people in private Facebook groups from linking to and sharing misinformation surrounding the virus. In private Facebook groups, including one that totals over 100,000 members, conspiracy theories spread that the coronavirus was an invention of the pharmaceutical industry, intended to sell the public on more expensive drugs and more vaccines.
While many posts simply encouraged people to take vitamins and eat a balanced diet to boost their immune system, others offered promises of immunity or cures if certain combinations of powders and drinks were consumed. Some were even more dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration referred to one "miracle mineral solution" posted many times on Facebook and Twitter as "the same as drinking bleach."
Dr. Chiang, the gastroenterologist, recently helped start the Association for Healthcare Social Media, a group dedicated to encouraging more health care professionals to post on social media so that they can dispel some of the misinformation.
"People are looking for good sources of information because a lot of what they see, when they log into their social media platforms, is just scaring them," he said.
While Twitter acknowledged the presence of some of this content on its network, Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said the company has not seen "large-scale, coordinated" efforts to misinform people about the coronavirus. After The New York Times contacted Twitter with examples of tweets containing health misinformation about coronavirus, some owners of the accounts were suspended "for spam."
Facebook said that in addition to working closely with health organizations, it was offering W.H.O. free ad space to try and point people toward accurate information on the coronavirus. The company said that it was removing posts that discouraged people from seeking treatment or suggested remedies that could cause physical harm and that it was placing warning labels on posts that were rated false by their fact checkers.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, also said it was working closely with W.H.O. to help combat misinformation. YouTube's spokesman, Farshad Shadloo, said the company had policies that prohibited videos that "promoted medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment."
Dozens of YouTube videos, however, included titles that suggested the video offered a cure for the virus. In others, the comment sections below the videos included links to pages offering a range of alternative, unsubstantiated treatments.
In some cases, those links have led people to websites that lure people in with the promise of a cure, but actually steal credit card information and other personal details.
The cybersecurity firm Check Point said more than 4,000 coronavirus-related websites that include words like "corona" or "covid" have been registered since the beginning of the year. Of those, 3 percent were considered malicious and another 5 percent were suspicious.
Research by Sophos, a cybersecurity company, has shown an uptick in these so-called spear-phishing messages targeting people in Italy, where coronavirus infections have surged in recent weeks. Those messages included a link to a Microsoft Word document that claimed to list cures for the virus. When downloaded, it installed malicious malware on people's computers.
Last month, W.H.O. also put out a warning about fake emails from apparent W.H.O. representatives. The emails carried malicious code aimed at breaking into someone's computing device.
John Gregory, the deputy health editor for NewsGuard, a start-up that tries to stop false stories from spreading on the internet, said the medical element to coronavirus misinformation made it different from other conspiracies the public has dealt with.
Because the information about the virus is "playing out in real time, it's always going to be easier for someone to make a false claim," Mr. Gregory said. "Then, there's a separation of a few days before anyone with a scientific background, or journalists, are able to debunk the claim."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "For National Security Council, a Mission Turns Upside Down" (front page, Feb. 22):
According to one who should know -- Gen. Colin Powell, the former national security adviser under President Ronald Reagan -- the head of the National Security Council is "first and foremost" a process manager.
He continued: "He must insure that the president gets full, objective, coherent and balanced recommendations on issues he must decide. ... He cannot allow unpleasant information to be shunted aside. ... He cannot allow the decision process to ill serve the president by keeping from him minority perspectives. ... The national security adviser must make sure that the president hears the strongest views as well as the weakest views."
But this process will work only if the president himself wants to hear these views and consider them.
Apparently President Trump does not. Only his views count.

Texto completo: Jeanine Cummins, whose novel about a Mexican woman and her son ignited a backlash, heard from some of her detractors in an episode that Apple TV Plus began streaming Friday.
When Oprah Winfrey selected "American Dirt" by Jeanine Cummins as her January book club pick, the novel seemed poised to be one of the year's major releases. It follows a mother and son fleeing Mexico for the United States to escape cartel violence and was described by its publisher as a modern-day version of "The Grapes of Wrath."
But the conversation surrounding the book quickly turned sour. After a scathing review by the writer Myriam Gurba, who said it relied on racist stereotypes, other Latinx writers and community members expressed similar criticism. "American Dirt" became a best seller, but its publisher, Flatiron, canceled a planned book tour and more than 100 writers signed an open letter asking Winfrey to reconsider her pick.
Winfrey decided instead to "lean in" to the conversation, she said. In an episode of her Apple TV Plus series, "Oprah's Book Club," that became available on Friday, she addressed the book, her decision to feature it and the backlash to both.
The two-part episode features Cummins in conversation with Winfrey, but in a departure from most "Oprah's Book Club" episodes, it includes three Latina writers critical of the book: Julissa Arce, an activist and author of "My (Underground) American Dream"; Esther Cepeda, a syndicated Washington Post columnist; and Reyna Grande, who has written several books about her experience crossing the border, including the memoir "The Distance Between Us."
Opening the show, Winfrey explained why she chose the book and defended the right of Cummins, who isn't Mexican, to write it. "I fundamentally, fundamentally believe in the right of anyone to use their imagination and their skills to tell stories and to empathize with another story," Winfrey said.
When asked whether she anticipated the negative reaction to it, Cummins said, "I definitely worried about this moment, about being called to account for having written the book."
She said she regretted a widely criticized line in the book's author's note, in which she wrote that she wished someone "slightly browner" had written the story. Talking with Winfrey, Cummins called it a "clumsy phrase," adding that it was "indicative of my own sort of grappling with my identity in these pages."
Cummins also drew criticism for writing about her husband's immigration to the U.S. from Ireland without noting his ethnicity. During the episode, she said his background was "absolutely relevant in why I was drawn to writing about immigration issues, and I felt like it was a thing that I wanted to mention," but said she regretted conflating her husband's experience with that of asylum seekers at the Mexico-U.S. border.
When Arce, Cepeda and Grande joined the discussion, they criticized the book as well as the broader publishing industry and its treatment of Latinx writers.
Reading "American Dirt," "I felt hurt and I felt undervalued," Grande said, "because the publishing industry does not have the same attitude with our immigrant stories as they did with your story." The books by Latinx writers that are published, she said, are "to little fanfare."
Cepeda said that writers of color are often expected to write solely about issues such as race and immigration, while white writers have much more liberty. "We have lots of other stories to tell than immigration stories," she said.
Don Weisberg, the president of Macmillan, which operates Flatiron, and Amy Einhorn, the editor who acquired "American Dirt," were in the audience. Weisberg said that increasing diversity in the company was a priority and that it had hired strategists to help. "Did those people suggest you hire more Latinos?" asked Cepeda.
"It sounds simple, but it's not simple," Weisberg said, adding that change was required on all levels at the company.
Despite the criticism of "American Dirt," the book has been a commercial success, spending six weeks on the New York Times best-seller list for combined print and e-book fiction and selling nearly 200,000 copies, according to NPD Book Scan. Being named a book club pick by Winfrey continues to be a boon for writers and typically all but ensures their work will land on the best-seller list.
But after the backlash to her selection of "American Dirt," Winfrey recently dropped her March pick, "My Dark Vanessa." Winfrey, through a spokeswoman, declined to say why, but after the taping of the "Oprah's Book Club" episode she told The Associated Press, "I'm not going to play it safer, but I'm not going to wade into water if I don't have to."
Missing from the conversation released Friday was Gurba, one of the first critics of "American Dirt." Arce pointed out her absence at one point, saying she wished Gurba was there to speak for herself.
In a phone interview on Friday, Gurba said she was disappointed that Winfrey kept the book as her pick. "The book didn't become problematic when the criticism was communicated to her, the book was problematic when she read it," Gurba said. "I'm disappointed that she doesn't want to engage privately regarding the issues raised by critics."
She, along with the writers Roberto Lovato and David Bowles, founded the media campaign #DignidadLiteraria amid the fallout over "American Dirt" and met with Flatiron and Macmillan last month to discuss diversity at the company.
"We're cautiously optimistic," Lovato said. But to Gurba, "the commitment that they made is very vague," she said, "and until they put real meat in that commitment, I'm not going to put much stock in it."
In a report released this week, Flatiron's president, Bob Miller, said the company had taken steps to address its lack of diversity, including hiring a new H.R. employee focused on recruitment from underrepresented groups and creating a database of "authenticity readers" for use on future titles. Miller also said that Flatiron is considering fellowships and mentoring programs for Latinx writers, adding, "Our hope is to continue to expand our outreach efforts in other underrepresented communities as well."

The election story being overlooked: Voting itself

Texto completo: If Election Day 2020 turns into a full-blown disaster, no one can say there weren't plenty of warning signs.
There were the Iowa caucuses, when glitches with an untested new app delayed the state's election results for havoc-filled days that turned into weeks. Or the Texas Democratic primary, where some Super Tuesday voters waited in line to vote for more than six hours while others simply gave up. Or the California primary that same day, when faulty new touch-screen voting equipment triggered hours-long waits in Los Angeles County.
If comparable disaster in November robs well-intentioned voters of their chance to be heard - or worse, gives bad-faith partisans an excuse to undermine the credibility of the vote - then the news media will bear a share of the blame.
Unless we move quickly.
As it stands, journalists aren't paying enough attention to this huge story in front of their eyes. Instead, news organizations are obsessed, as always, with horse-race coverage.
Political reporters scrutinize every public-opinion poll as if it were the I Ching. Cable pundits blather about the potential impact of the candidates' latest gaffes, despite how notoriously bad they are at such prognostications.
What they are not obsessed with, sadly, is the very core of Election Day: voting itself.
"The media has a huge role to play in helping things to go well," said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine and the author of "Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust and the Threat to American Democracy."
But, Hasen said, that has to happen now, not in September or October when it's too late.
If journalists turn their searchlights on potential problems, Hasen told me, they can help prevent "situations where losers don't accept the results as legitimate."
They can do this by reporting stories that put pressure on local and state officials to take remedial action.
There's no shortage of potential targets for journalists: malfunctioning equipment, insufficient or poorly run polling places, unfair or discriminatory voter registration, and flawed methods of doing recounts.
Many experts are convinced that the gold-standard method for casting votes is the old-fashioned hand-marked paper ballot, which Hasen calls "the least hackable and the most audit-able." But, as Sue Halpern wrote in the New Yorker last year, vendors of fancy new voting systems have been aggressive in their efforts to sell municipalities on their frequently opaque products.
Despite all this rich story material, not many news organizations have dedicated themselves to sustained scrutiny.
Yes, there is plenty of attention paid when something goes wrong, as in Iowa or on Super Tuesday. But overall, the coverage tends to be haphazard, after-the-fact, and not oriented enough to deeper issues such as the pressures and inducements for governments to invest in untried new voting machines.
I don't buy the argument that there are insufficient newsroom resources. After all, virtually every newsroom has at least some political reporters. And they often run in packs, producing scoop-oriented coverage that's not much different from their peers at other networks or newspapers.
But there are precious few voting-beat specialists. Prominent among that rarefied group are Pam Fessler at NPR and Ari Berman at Mother Jones. Some major news companies, including The Washington Post, are also beefing up their coverage.
Berman often focuses on what has happened since 2013, when the Supreme Court struck at the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He reported that the long lines on Super Tuesday trace directly back to the high court's ruling that states no longer need federal approval to close polling places. That empowered Texas alone to close more than 600 polling places in recent years.
"It disproportionately hurt Democratic and minority voters, because 70 percent of the polling places were closed in the 50 counties in the state with the largest growth of black and Latino voters," Berman said in a recent Democracy Now interview.
The New York Times's Nikole Hannah-Jones suggested that this trend amounts to a "poll tax" because such voters may have to give up a day's pay to cast their ballots. And, of course, high turnout - which ought to be a primary goal in a democracy - only makes the lines longer.
Hasen is also concerned about an even larger problem: mechanical error, mixed with human misjudgment.
"You're more likely to be disenfranchised by incompetence," he argued, "than voter suppression." The Iowa caucuses are a case in point; with those results still murky, it amounted to "a failed election."
No one should want that in November. A scenario in which President Trump is defeated at the polls but refuses to give up the Oval Office because he charges the election was rigged? It doesn't exactly strain credulity.
All the more reason for the press to redirect at least some of its attention from the drama of the latest poll numbers to something far more important. And to do it now when it matters most.
Rock the vote? By all means.
But cover the vote first.

Jesse Jackson endorses Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: The Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for president Sunday, offering support that the senator and his team hope will rally black voters to their side before a key primary race in Michigan.
“With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States, and our needs are not moderate," Jackson, a longtime civil rights activist and presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988, said in a statement. “A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.
“The Biden campaign has not reached out to me or asked for my support," he added. “The Sanders campaign has, and they responded to the issues I raised."
Speaking before thousand of voters gathered in the western Michigan city of Grand Rapids, Sanders lavished praise on Jackson, citing his insurgent bid for the White House in 1988, when he became a leading candidate before ultimately losing to Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
“It is one of the honors of my life to be supported by a man who has put his life on the line for the last 50 years fighting for justice," he told a largely white crowd of thousands gathered for an outdoor rally. “Everything that Jesse Jackson said is what this campaign is about."
Sanders has cast his two presidential campaigns in the lineage of Jackson's 1988 presidential bid, telling advisers in 2015 that he hoped to model his 2016 operation after that effort. Political contemporaries, the two septuagenarian liberal activists are longtime allies: In 1988, Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vt., was slapped by an “irate citizen" after supporting Jackson in the state's caucuses.
Michigan's caucuses that year marked a high point for Jackson's campaign. He beat Dukakis in the state by building support among black voters and liberal white caucusgoers.
New York Times
In this era of coronavirus, rallies to continue, for now
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — As the coronavirus hits more states, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday his campaign is gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health specialists say could be breeding grounds to spread the potentially deadly illness.
“Obviously what is most important to us is to protect the health of the American people," Sanders said as he appeared in a series of TV interviews. “And what I will tell you, we are talking to public health officials all over this country."
“This is an issue that every organization, every candidate has got to deal with," he said.
Federal health authorities have been advising older people and those with medical conditions, in particular, to avoid crowded spaces, prompting the cancellation of music and arts festivals and other events around the country.
But that so far hasn't led President Trump or his two remaining major Democratic rivals, Sanders and Joe Biden, to cut back on big campaign events. Each man is in his 70s.
Sanders said “in the best of all possible worlds" the three candidates should probably limit their travel and avoid crowds, “but right now, we're running as hard as we can."
Trump on Saturday said he wasn't worried about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House after the first case in the nation's capital was confirmed over the weekend.
The Trump campaign said Sunday it is “proceeding as normal" amid the outbreak, though it has yet to announce the president's next rally.

Trump to skip St. Patrick's luncheon on Capitol Hill
Irish eyes at the US Capitol will not smile on President Trump on St. Patrick's Day.
Trump is skipping an annual bipartisan luncheon with House and Senate lawmakers celebrating the ties that bind the United States and Ireland, a White House spokesman said.
Trump blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Since the speaker has chosen to tear this nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the president will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity," spokesman Judd Deere said in an e-mailed statement.
The House speaker traditionally hosts the luncheon.
Trump instead will celebrate with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House on Thursday — five days before St. Patrick's Day.

Texto completo: Bill and Colette Smedley boarded a Princess Cruises ship Jan. 5, just five days before the first death in Wuhan, China, was linked to a quickly spreading coronavirus.
The Dillsburg couple was headed into the heart of Asia's seaports in Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan on a 29-day cruise.
Before the cruise was over, the coronavirus had reached their ship and would ultimately infect hundreds of the passengers.
The trip to celebrate their 33 years of marriage lasted longer than they had expected, as the Medleys hunkered down under quarantine in a windowless cruise cabin for 10 more days and then spent another two weeks confined on a Texas military base.
The march of the virus The Smedleys planned the cruise on short notice.
Colette Smedley had already booked a cruise through the Panama Canal, a trip they've always wanted to do. They hoped to tie it into seeing their son, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. But they realized, after she booked it, that it was scheduled for 2021.
So, they decided to see parts of Asia this year on the Diamond Princess.
"We like getting out of the cold, miserable Central Pennsylvania weather for the winter. Why not?" Bill Smedley said Friday, now safely home from their ordeal. He had always wanted to see Vietnam.
The ship's 3,600 passengers were primarily American and Australian residents, but eventually about half of them rotated out, and more Asian guests arrived.
One of those was a man from China, who eventually got off in Hong Kong and went straight to the hospital, even though he wasn't showing signs of the virus.
Throughout the trip, CNN and Fox News reports on the cruise ship's televisions showed the virus marching through China and other parts of Asia.
"It just kept escalating every day," he said.
The Smedleys' temperatures were checked when they got off in ports like Osaca and Okinawa, but the trip was nearly over by then.
The trip – for them – was supposed to end Feb. 3, so the night before leaving, protocol is to place luggage in the hallway outside of staterooms for the crew to take it off the ship. The Smedleys did that before going to dinner Feb. 2, but when they returned, their luggage had been returned to the room.
"We were like uh-oh," Smedley said.
Inside a cabin for 10 days It turned out that the man from China who left the boat had the coronavirus, even though he hadn't shown symptoms before leaving the ship. The entire ship was under quarantine for 10 days.
They were docked in Japan and became the focus of the world, for a time with the highest concentration of coronavirus cases outside of China.
Their cruise cabin had a bed and a desk chair with no window or balcony.
"We were laying in bed all day long," he said. Free internet and, eventually, more cable channels helped entertain the couple. They read, researched the virus, endured interviews with news media and checked Facebook. They had also made acquaintances on the ship, who they talked to on the ship's phones.
Eventually, because they didn't have a balcony, they were allowed to walk on the decks occasionally, in limited numbers. They kept their distance from others, Smedley said.
Food arrived at their door. The passengers were required to wear a medical mask, as was the crew member delivering the food.
U.S. Rep. Scott Perry and members of his office kept in close contact with the Smedleys while the numbers of those afflicted with the virus grew.
At one point, Colette had a fever and was tested for the virus three times. "Both of us were really worried," he said, but no word back from the ship meant no infection.
By Feb. 13, the number of people infected with the virus on that ship reached 218, according to the New York Times.
"We knew that quarantine wasn't working on the ship, because the number kept growing," Smedley said.
As of Tuesday, more than 700 confirmed cases of the coronavirus were tied to that cruise; six of them have died.
Americans taken off the ship Under the tight control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Americans were taken off the ship and sent to a Texas military base, Lackland Air Force Base.
"People in Texas weren't happy that we were there," Smedley said. Local leaders didn't want the cruise passengers in their community. "It's just total politics. ... The people we were with, we weren't sick. We were never sick."
At Lackland, the Smedleys had two rooms and the ability to walk outside. Smedley gives credit to the tremendous work of the CDC and HHS to get them home safely.
"They were more than professional. They looked out for our medical well-being and our emotional well-being," Smedley said.
The captain of the Diamond Princess had been filling in for another who was on vacation, Smedley said. "He was nothing but spectacular the whole time. He was the last man to get off the ship."
Home again The Smedleys arrived home earlier this week, returning to life as usual.
Well, sort of. Interview requests have continued. Smedley turned down a trip to New York City for an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN.
"Are you nuts? I've been traveling everywhere for two months," Smedley said.
They went to the American Legion Wednesday for bingo night and invited friends to the house.
"There are people out there who are afraid to be around us," Smedley said. "But I'm not going to curtail my behavior."
Two months of being attached to each other hasn't changed the Smedleys, but for now, they're spending a little time doing things apart from one another.
And they're still planning that cruise next year through the Panama Canal.

Texto completo: Koreshan State Park, in conjunction with Friends of Koreshan State Park, is pleased to announce its continuing participation in Women's History Month during March 2020. The theme of the events will be The Women of Koreshan Unity Settlement.
The utopian settlement, founded by Dr. Cyrus Teed, was established in Estero, Florida in 1894 and lasted until its last member died in 1982. The Koreshan Unity offered women an unprecedented voice in the leadership and management of the community during a pivotal period in American history.
Tickets for all public events and programs available at friendsofkoreshan.org/product/womens-history-month-tours-and-events.
March 13, and 27: Reserve a spot in one of these special public tours of the Historic Settlement led by women guides in period costumes. Visitors will have the opportunity to interact with historical interpreters of some of the Koreshan women and learn about their lives. Special tours will be offered at 11 a.m. The 90-minute tours will be limited to 25 people and tickets are available for $15. For a video overview of a tour, visit https://vimeo.com/smellycatproductions/download/259478629/98f3626e56.
March 17: The Friends of Koreshan State Park will present a talk by Adam Morris, author of "American Messiahs." In its April 19, 2019 book review, the New York Times states the book reveals fundamental themes and contradictions and the deeper human impulses addressed by several charismatic prophets. These prophets dissented from traditional Christianity and claimed, in one way or another, to represent God himself. Morris features Koreshan Unity Settlement founder Cyrus Teed as one of the handful of religious leaders profiled in his important book. Morris' talk begins at 7 p.m. in the Art Hall at Koreshan State Park. Tickets are $15. Seating is limited.
March 24: Join us for An Evening with the Koreshans at 7 p.m. in the Art Hall at Koreshan State Park. Dr. Thomas Cimarusti from Florida Gulf Coast University will give a talk and samples of music from the Koreshan archive surrounding their annual Lunar Festival. Tickets are $15. Seating is limited.
Private Group Tours: To schedule a private group tour during March, please fill out the online form at friendsofkoreshan.org/womens-history-month-private-tour-request or call (239) 949-2379. Private group tours are $15 per person, 10-person minimum. To download a video overview of a tour, visit https://vimeo.com/smellycatproductions/download/259478629/98f3626e56.
Koreshan State Park, located at 3800 Corkscrew Road in Estero, holds a unique position in the collection of Florida state parks. Throughout its history, Florida has welcomed pioneers of all kinds and Cyrus Reed Teed was probably the most unusual, bringing followers to Estero in 1894 to build the "New Jerusalem" for his new faith, Koreshanity. The colony, known as the Koreshan Unity, believed the entire universe existed within a giant, hollow sphere, and that God was both male and female, and therefore, men and women were considered equals. The colony began fading after Teed´s death in 1908, and in 1961 the last four members deeded the final 305 acres of land to the state. What remains of their once vibrant community of 250 members are 11 beautifully maintained historic structures that date from 1882-1920 along with landscaped grounds. Today, visitors can fish, picnic, paddle, and hike where Teed´s visionaries once lived and created their own utopia.
Interact with historical interpreters of some of the Koreshan women and learn about their lives during the special tours.

Texto completo: Daisy really likes to eat dirt. She doesn't discriminate if there's only mud available. When a new batch of dirt is delivered, she spends the whole day sampling.
When she pinched a trunkful off the ground one recent Thursday morning, Natalie Thomas took note of the interesting behavior.
"It's very odd," Thomas said. "She must like the taste."
Daisy shares her home, the elephant exhibit at the Memphis Zoo, with four others: Gina, Bambi, Asali and Tyranza, known as "Ty," who is the oldest living African elephant in North America, the zoo says. About 50 students from Rhodes College, like Thomas, have logged thousands of hours of behavioral observations of the herd at Memphis Zoo since 2011.
The long-term research project, a partnership between Rhodes and the zoo, is a study in elephant behavior and social dynamics. Each elephant's behavioral quirks — like Daisy's penchant for eating dirt — establish patterns of behavior that reveal personalities and a social hierarchy.
This substantial amount of continuous data will show how elephants age.
When the time comes, it will also show how a herd grieves.
The death of a leader in the herd is an inevitability in both captivity and the wild, but one of increased frequency for the vulnerable species, whose population is in decline largely due to poaching.
Thomas is "not looking forward to that day" the grief study begins, she said, explaining the strength of social bonds between the female herd.
But she recognizes the rare opportunity to continue with the research, which she began participating in last summer.
How the data gets collected Rhodes professor Sarah Boyle works with Steve Reichling, the zoo's director of conservation and research, on several partnership projects at the zoo.
Rhodes students have collected 6,000 hours of observation each for Ty, Gina and Asali. They've accumulated 500 hours each for Bambi and Daisy, who joined the herd within the last two years.
Of the partnership projects, the elephant study is the longest-running. It's not common to have so many hours of behavior observations for one herd, Boyle explained.
Over the course of an hour at the zoo, students like Thomas make note of elephant behavior every two minutes, logging the code for that behavior and indicating where in the exhibit the elephant is located.
The data qualifies the interactions between each elephant, categorizing them as positive, negative and neutral interactions, which can be matched with how close the elephants are to one another.
Eating, unsurprisingly, is the most common activity for Thomas to observe, she said. At this point, she's memorized the locations on the grid where barrels of hay dangle down for elephants to grab.
Thomas is quick to note the hierarchy: "Bambi and Daisy will share a barrel. Asali will have a barrel to herself or share with Ty. But Gina will steal a barrel from Asali, Bambi and Daisy."
Behavior patterns reveal how elephants respond and rebuild after death Right now, it's not clear whether or not Ty, the oldest, is still the true matriarch, or leader, of the herd, Boyle said.
Gina, the spunkiest elephant of the bunch, is beginning to take on that role in some aspects. The students and other staff at the zoo have all developed their own opinions about the shift in behavior, and whether Gina has taken the role over from Ty.
Daisy falls into the third spot, said Amanda Schweighart, the zoo's elephant manager. Bambi and Asali fall to the bottom of the herd's social structure, with neither wanting to be the boss over the other.
Thomas interprets the behaviors as the matriarch position being in a transitional phase, she said. Memphis Zoo's herd of five females is much smaller than a herd that would generally be found in the wild, Thomas said, but elephants in the wild also separate into herds by gender.
The oldest elephant in the herd, which is oftentimes the matriarch, is usually the target of poachers, since the older elephants generally have the longest tusks.
"So when that poacher kills a 60-year-old matriarch, (the herd is) losing 60 years of information, especially if it's made up primarily of younger elephants," she said. "They've lost that information of where it's safe to go, where to find water, where to find food, which animals to avoid, everything."
On the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya, researchers have spent years observing the social dynamics of elephant herds. As matriarchs and other elephants in the herd have died, they've watched on to observe how the animals cope.
Doctoral student Shifra Goldenberg shared a video with National Geographic of elephants on the reserve after the death of a matriarch named Queen Victoria. Though some researchers disagree on whether to call elephants' actions "grief" (that could imply that researchers know what the elephants are thinking), there are clearly observable behaviors that highlight the emotional bonds.
Elephants in the video gather with one another around Queen Victoria's body, inspecting it with their trunks. After a death in the herd, elephants have scattered their family members' bones and raised a foot over the body. Others have pushed and pulled a body as other elephants stood by silently and as others rocked back and forth, National Geographic reported.
The responses vary, but are striking, and highlight that the behavior observed is driven by emotion, and not out of necessity, George Wittemyer, a longtime researcher at the reserve, told National Geographic in 2016.
"The fact that they interact and have behavioral interactions with their dead in a form that is not explainable in any simple, evolutionary context speaks to the deeper emotional lives of elephants that we can't easily study," he said.
Wittemyer is part of another research project on orphan elephants whose families and herds have been disrupted by poaching. The research, as reported by The New York Times in 2016, logs orphan behavior, tracking positive and negative interactions among the herd, much like the research done by Rhodes students at the Memphis Zoo.
The research shows how elephants both respond to death and rebuild.
Research also encourages visitor education Thomas has always preferred animals to people, she said, but the research work has led to more interaction than she'd thought. As people ask her questions about why she's watching the elephants with a clipboard and a stopwatch, in telling them about her research, she's also telling them about why the elephants matter.
"I've even had little kids come up to me and be like, 'Are you a scientist?'" she said. "There was a little girl who wanted to be an author, and her sister wanted to be the scientist" who would write the book about her sister's research.
