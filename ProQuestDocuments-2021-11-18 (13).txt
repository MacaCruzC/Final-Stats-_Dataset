Texto completo: Striking RNs still give care

On the very day that Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center refused to end its ridiculous on-call policies, striking nurses still cared for patients, even while outside the hospital on the picket line.

A stranger collapsed from heat exhaustion and the nurses rushed to his side. Some provided direct care, others fanned him with signs they'd been holding to protest their unfair treatment. Another called for help.

Hospital officials have said that their final offer to cut on-call by a meager 10 percent over 18 months is competitive and in line with local standards.

That is not the case.

At my place of employment, the University of Toledo Medical Center, the former Medical College of Ohio, no nurse can be forced to work more than 16 hours in a 24-hour period, with an annual cap of 100 hours of mandatory overtime.

These provisions are designed to prevent nurse exhaustion and burnout and safeguard patient safety.

The UAW nurses, tech support, and support staff are standing up for the very sick and injured of our community.

If Mercy Health St. Vincent leaders stop and think about what an investment in proper staffing would mean for our community, they would realize this is how you benefit the patients and the community, while preserving the hospital's flexibility to deliver quality patient care.

Subsidize news

In regard to your recent articles about the Ohio legislature's corrupt effort to subsidize FirstEnergy's two outdated nuclear power plants in the state, at a cost of $150 million billed directly to residents, I would like to add this:

If you're going to bail out obsolete industries in Ohio, why not consider the state's daily newspapers, which have been struggling to remain profitable for years, layoff after layoff? Ohio can get electrical power from many other states, but local news is not so easily replaced.

According to a recent statement by New York Times editor Dean Baquet: The greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news. -… I don't know what the answer is. Their economic model is gone. I think most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years, except for the ones that have been bought by a local billionaire.

Ohio state legislature, send your local newspapers a lifeline.

Texto completo: Is being unfit grounds to impeach a president? James Madison appears to have thought so when he said, during the debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, that a president could be removed for “incapacity, negligence or perfidy. ” Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, has put forward articles of impeachment on those very grounds, saying, “An unfit president can be impeached for those misdeeds that corrupt and harm society. ”
Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in essence, publicly implied that Trump is too mentally impaired to function as president. If that’s true, doesn’t she have a constitutional duty to act?
Trump arrived late to his meeting on infrastructure with Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. He did not shake anyone’s hand, he did not sit down, but instead, according to Pelosi, he pounded the table and launched into a diatribe about her comments accusing him of having engaged "in a cover-up" before he stormed out of the room. The entire “meeting” lasted maybe more than three minutes.
Read more commentary:
Trump's cognitive deficits seem worse. We need to know if he has dementia: Psychologist
On Trump's mental fitness, the experts are silenced and the public's in the dark
What's going on with Donald Trump? Psychologist explains the president’s lies, reversals
“I walked into the room and I told Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, 'I want to do infrastructure. … But, you know what? You can’t do it under these circumstances,” Trump said in the Rose Garden minutes later, announcing that he will refuse to carry out his legislative duties as president, unless Congress agrees to stop carrying out their duties of oversight. “You probably can’t go down two tracks. You can go down the investigation track and you can go down the investment track. ” (“You can’t investigate and legislate simultaneously — it just doesn’t work that way,” he later tweeted. )
Presumably, by definition, Trump is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office” — the 25th Amendment standard — if he simply refuses to do his job. Presidents aren’t allowed to go on strike.
Mental stability of Trump in question
The next day, Pelosi was still visibly shaken: “The president again stormed out. ” She said “again” because Trump previously did the same thing during a meeting with Pelosi and Schumer aimed at ending the government shutdown. Pelosi then slapped the dais with her hand and said, “Pound the table. Walk out the door. What? … Another temper tantrum. " Pelosi made it clear that this was far more serious than just bad behavior. “Again, I pray for the president of the United States. I wish that his family, or his administration or his staff would have an intervention. … Maybe he wants to take a leave of absence. ”
“Your prayer comments almost suggest you’re concerned about his well being,” said a reporter.
“I am. ”
News reports described Pelosi as “joking” about the 25th Amendment when reporters asked her whether she was suggesting a “statutory intervention. ”
“I thought you said statutory intervention. That would be good. Article 25. . . . That's a good idea. . . . I'll take it up with my caucus, not that they haven't been thinking about it," she said.
Indeed, members of the Democratic caucus have been thinking about it. After Pelosi’s remarks, Rep. Jackie Speier of California said, "I have felt for some time that the mental stability of the president of the United States is in question … and I suggested invoking the 25th Amendment,” citing mental health professionals who have diagnosed him as a "malignant narcissist," showing symptoms of anti-social behavior, paranoia and sadism.
This is not the first time Pelosi has confronted the issue of whether Trump is psychologically fit for office. In March, she told The Washington Post that Trump was “ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I don’t think he’s fit to be president of the United States. ” On April 10, she told The Associated Press that “in every way he is unfit to be the president of the United States. ”
Trump's diagnosis: mentally unfit for office
Many of us in the mental health community have been arguing for years that Trump should be removed because he is psychologically unfit. We posted a professional petition online stating that “in our professional judgment … Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of president of the United States. ” It garnered over 70,000 signatures, formed a professional organization, Duty To Warn, dedicated solely to this issue and has held rallies across the country, and published a best-selling book, "The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump. "
Most recently, "Dangerous Case" editor Bandy Lee and a group of colleagues issued a mental health analysis of the Mueller report in which they concluded “there is compelling medical evidence” that Trump “lacks the capacity to serve as president. ” He manifests “impaired capacity to make responsible decisions free of impulsivity,” as well as an "inability to consider consequences before taking action, detachment from reality, paranoid reactions, creation of dangerous conditions, and cognitive and memory difficulties. "
While some have tried to dismiss these professional assessments as partisan, that charge is belied by the members of Trump’s own administration, who have privately mused about the 25th Amendment. "Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the Cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment,” wrote the anonymous author of a famed New York Times op-ed. White House staff frequently texted “#TFA” among themselves whenever Trump “did something that was just so insane, and so crazy, and unhinged,” Omarosa Manigault Newman told MSNBC. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, according to reports, admitted that he proposed invoking the 25th Amendment, though he later claimed (unconvincingly it seems to us) to have been joking.
However, the Republican Cabinet will never invoke the 25th, so where does that leave Democrats?
After Trump's temper tantrum in the White House last week, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said, “Most of us on the Judiciary Committee have just thrown up our hands” and said “let’s go ahead and launch an impeachment inquiry. ”
Impeach Trump to protect office of president
In the same interview on NBC News, he said, “Today the 25th Amendment has come resurging back into focus because of these extraordinary events that took place in the White House. . . . Speaker Pelosi showed her compassionate side when she said there should be a family intervention. Unfortunately, some conditions are way beyond the capacity of a family intervention to address. This might be far more serious. "
Citing Lee’s mental health analysis of the Mueller report, Raskin said, “The president is failing at every level of basic mental and cognitive health. He cannot take in information successfully. He cannot process information successfully. He cannot engage in decision-making without bias, distortion, impulsivity, impetuosity, and he cannot keep himself and others free from danger. ”
Though Raskin did not directly cite Trump’s lack of mental fitness as the constitutional ground for opening an impeachment inquiry, the context suggests that it was certainly on his mind, and adds to the urgency to the need for such an inquiry, if nothing else. Clearly Congress has an obligation, as James Madison said, to protect the nation against a chief executive who has demonstrated “incapacity. ”
Pelosi has thus far resisted calls for impeachment on the grounds that it would arouse the ire of Trump’s base going into the 2020 election. But she seems to ignore the opposite risk: Underreacting desensitizes us to the dangerous severity of Trump’s dysfunction, normalizing the abnormal.

Texto completo: A Republican gerrymandering guru urged the Trump administration to include a citizenship question on next year's census, contending its addition would create a clear election year advantage for the GOP, according to court documents.
Longtime redistricting specialist Thomas Hofeller "played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question ... to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,'" read a four-page letter from lawyers opposing the measure.
The missive to Manhattan Federal Judge Jesse Furman charged that Department of Justice official John Gore and Trump transition team adviser Mark Neuman both "concealed Dr. Hofeller's role in crafting the October 2017 draft letter and the (Voting Rights Act) enforcement rationale it advances.
"Based on this new evidence, it appears that both Neuman and Gore falsely testified about the genesis of DOJ's request (for the citizenship question) in ways that obscured the pretextual character of the request."
The administration claimed the citizenship query was designed to enforce the Voting Rights Act and maximize representation for the Latino population. But Hofeller, commissioned by a conservative website in 2015 to examine redistricting, actually determined the citizenship question "would clearly be a disadvantage for the Democrats," the letter alleged.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue by the end of June.
The New York Times reported that Hofeller's estranged daughter Stephanie came across her father's writings on the topic among some 75,000 files stored on four external hard drives and 18 thumb drives used to back up information on his laptop. She discovered the documents after his death last August.

Just weeks before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller after his death in August. It reveals that Hofeller "played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' " plaintiffs' lawyers challenging the question wrote in a letter Thursday morning to U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year. The lawyers also argued that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller's role in court proceedings.
The letter drew on new information discovered on hard drives belonging to Hofeller, which were found inadvertently by his estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina.
The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census "would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats" and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers' letter to Furman.
The evidence, first reported by the New York Times, contradicts sworn testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's expert adviser A. Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said.
A Justice Department spokesman issued a statement disputing the report of new evidence. "These eleventh-hour allegations by the plaintiffs, including an accusation of dishonesty against a senior Department of Justice official, are false," the statement said. It also said that Hofeller's study "played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census."
The Commerce Department referred questions about the new information to the Justice Department.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in U.S. District Court Thursday morning for "sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony" by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU.
It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU filed a letter with the court Thursday afternoon to "respectfully inform" it of the motion filed in the New York district court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week.
The letter repeated the charge contained in the letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to the 2020 Census to give white Republicans a redistricting advantage and that the Trump administration "obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations."
Ho's letter did not ask the court to take action, but drew its attention to the new motion and that the hearing would be Wednesday.
"Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census," Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. "Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday's hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments."
The Supreme Court heard the case April 23. Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared that the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.
If the court followed normal procedure, it voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are now writing the opinion.
The ACLU also asked the District Court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public. On Thursday, Furman ordered that the government must provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday and called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump's election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said.
"It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing," he said.
Ho said sanctions could include fines imposed on witnesses or the government, a reopening of the case or an amendment of the final judgment to account for new evidence.
The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and determine congressional representation and redistricting. Opponents of the citizenship question have argued that it will suppress response to the survey among immigrant communities, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live.
Hofeller's files also reveal that in August 2017 he helped ghostwrite a draft Justice Department letter to the Commerce Department requesting a citizenship question and coming up with a rationale - to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, the plaintiffs' lawyers said. He then gave this letter to Gore, the principal deputy assistant attorney general, in October 2017, they said.
The genesis of that request and the rationale behind it were key questions in trials challenging the question. Ross initially had told Congress that the request was initiated by the Justice Department in a December 2017 letter, but administration documents released in the case later indicated that it came at Ross's urging, starting months earlier. Census and voting rights experts have said the question is not needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act.
The Justice Department letter "bears striking similarities to Dr. Hofeller's 2015 study, stating that a citizenship question on the Census was essential to advantaging Republicans and white voters," the letter to Furman said. It added: "Based on this new evidence, it appears that both Neuman and Gore falsely testified about the genesis of DOJ's request to Commerce in ways that obscured the pretextual character of the request."
Critics of the question blasted the administration after the news broke.
"Republican political operatives plainly want to deny communities of color the health care, education and other services they need in order to consolidate GOP power and a whiter electorate," said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. "We call on Congress to hold Trump administration officials - including Secretary Ross - accountable now and not to wait until after the Supreme Court ruling to do so."
Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee, said the new information undercut the bureau's years of work to plan a nonpartisan count.
"Revelations that this administration threw a grenade into that process in order to achieve partisan goals must be a gut-punch to every career Census employee whose goal is to earn the public's trust and confidence in the 2020 Census," she said.

Texto completo: "Protecting the Shield" — an investigative series on police accountability by the Asbury Park Press — won an award from the New York City Deadline Club, one of the most competitive regional journalism competitions in the country.
The winners were announced earlier this month in a ceremony at the Harvard Club of New York City which featured a talk by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. Other winners included work from The New York Times, The Associated Press, Reuters, CNN and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
The Press' 2018 series won in the category for reporting by newspapers with a circulation under 100,000. The Deadline Club is the New York City chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.
"Protecting the Shield" revealed tens of millions of dollars spent to hush allegations of police abuse, including claims of injury and wrongful death. The series exposed systemic flaws that allowed bad cops to flourish and prompted two statewide policy changes: random drug testing for all police officers and an internal affairs reform that increased oversight of cops.
The series was written by Andrew Ford, Kala Kachmar, Susanne Cervenka, Alex Gecan, Ken Serrano and Paul D'Ambrosio. The project was edited by Executive Editor D'Ambrosio. The online version of the story was designed by Digital Innovator Felecia Wellington Radel with social outreach by Engagement Editor Courtney Marabella. Videos were done by Ford, Kachmar and Thomas P. Costello, with editing by Ryan Ross.
"Protecting the Shield" won several journalism prizes this year, including national awards:
American Bar Association Silver Gavel Award – a national award for outstanding reporting on legal issues.
Livingston Award – Ford was chosen as a finalist for a national award for reporting by journalists under age 35 for selections from the series.
National Headliner award – a video, which you can see at the top of this story, won a third-place prize in this national competition.
New Jersey Press Association's public service prize – the series won the top journalism prize in New Jersey.
USA Today Network competition – The series, main video and web design were named finalists in three categories of the national competition — public service, video and design.

Assange is a spy, not a journalist

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a “nonstate hostile intelligence service.” Apparently Julian Assange agrees.
In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an “intelligence agency” for the people.
Now, at long last, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.
The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his “thermonuclear device” -- releasing a tranche of more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables, all unredacted. According to the indictment, those cables “included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential. These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety.”
The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange’s decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban.
The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, “We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them.”
Assange’s stolen classified documents didn’t just find their way to the Taliban; the indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered “a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization al-Qaida in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks” as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.
Indeed, Assange’s disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his “Gitmo files “which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him.
One of Assange’s stolen documents -— the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida’s captured operational commander — revealed that Faraj had “reported on al-Qaida’s methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means”; that he had “received a letter from UBL’s designated courier” who was “the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan”; and that “in mid-2003, [Faraj] moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar,” Pakistan.
The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj. Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout. Fortunately, U.S. Special Operations forces did not give bin Laden time to figure it out.
The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.
Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike “reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections.” So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.
Regardless, Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy. The fact that he gave stolen U.S. intelligence to al-Qaida, the Taliban, China, Iran and other adversaries via a website rather than dead-drops is irrelevant. He engaged in espionage against the United States. And he has no remorse for the harm he has caused. He once called the innocent people hurt by his disclosures “collateral damage” and admitted WikiLeaks might get “blood on our hands.”
Sorry, he does not get to aid and abet our enemies, put countless lives at risk and then hide behind the First Amendment. The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes.

Texto completo: Last week’s Associated Press photograph of Mount Everest shows a long line of hundreds of climbers in brightly colored gear inching their way to the peak as if they were waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disney World.
"How do they get down? There’s an elevator, right?" quips Joel Schauer, 58, of Hawthorn Woods. Schauer didn’t have to share his Everest moment with hundreds of fellow climbers when he scaled the peak in 2016. He and a guide left the South Col at 25,938 feet at 7 p.m. and arrived at the summit at 6:45 a.m. by themselves.
"There were two people who turned around in front of me when I was making it to the top," Schauer remembers.
Exhausted after the last 12-hour climb, his zipper frozen by the condensation from his breathing mask in the below-zero temperatures, and with a dwindling oxygen supply at 29,029 feet, Schauer didn’t even remove his face mask for the photo of him displaying his "On The Top: Fairchild Automotive" flag from his Lake Zurich business.
"This is nice," Schauer remembers thinking during the hour he spent on top of the world before others arrived and safety became his top concern. "How long can I live here? Look around, enjoy it and get down."
More than 300 people have died climbing Everest since 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the top. So far this month, at least 11 climbers have died while scaling the world’s tallest mountain, the latest a 62-year-old Colorado attorney who had reached the peak and was starting his descent, which can be just as dangerous.
"On the way down, I was trying to suck oxygen, and there wasn’t enough there," remembers Schauer. At one point he slipped and found himself dangling from a rope. "I’m looking out at the Himalayas upside-down," he says. He somehow managed to get a grip with the crampons on his boots digging into the ice, pulled himself up and made it safely back to base camp.
A climber at crowded Everest last week told CNN about having to step over dead bodies on the path. Schauer, whose first Everest attempt in 2014 was canceled after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas, says he didn’t see any bodies during his successful climb two years later. Some critics have blamed the deaths during this climbing season, which ended this week, on the growing number of climbers. Many are unprepared, and the crowding is caused by an increase in the number of companies leading the expeditions.
"Is it hubris? Might be. Is it bad preparation? Might be. Is it the line? Might be," Schauer says, adding that changing the protocol to call for more oxygen for the trip down from the summit might help. A story in The New York Times on Wednesday says Nepalese officials are considering changes that would bar inexperienced climbers and make it more difficult to get a permit.
Whether going up or down, the process is slow and tedious and climbers have to maneuver past each other. "You have to do the Everest dance," Schauer says, describing the process of moving along the guide rope. "You unclip, move, reclip, move. You’re clipping and unclipping 10,000 times."
And when you are exhausted, dealing with the altitude, short on air, and numb from the cold, it’s difficult to improvise.
"It’s really hard to get off that line. There’s nowhere to go," Schauer says. "You’re limited to the slowest person in line."
Schauer and his wife, Kathy, parents of three grown children, Jennifer, Melissa and Jake, became grandparents a week ago with the birth of Addison Grace to Jake and Elizabeth Schauer. Earlier in the year, Joel Schauer reached another milestone when he climbed to the top of Aconcagua in Argentina, making him just the 48th person to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents and ski to both the North and South poles.
The lessons he learns from climbing about building strong teams, planning well and taking "intelligent risks" help him run his business, Schauer says. Everest will always be one of his major accomplishments, but he doesn’t see the need to climb it again. His daughter Jennifer is going to run a not-for-profit for abused girls in Kathmandu, the Nepal city where most Everest climbers embark on their adventure. But Schauer says, "you can climb an equally beautiful mountain without so many people on it."
Considering all his world-famous climbs, ask him about what he is most proud of, and Schauer breaks into a big smile.
"That’s easy," Schauer says. "My granddaughter."

Exhausted after the last 12-hour climb, his zipper frozen by the condensation from his breathing mask in the below-zero temperatures, and with a dwindling oxygen supply at 29,029 feet, Schauer didn’t even remove his face mask for the photo of him displaying his "On The Top: Fairchild Automotive" flag from his Lake Zurich business.
"This is nice," Schauer remembers thinking during the hour he spent on top of the world before others arrived and safety became his top concern. "How long can I live here? Look around, enjoy it and get down."
More than 300 people have died climbing Everest since 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the top. So far this month, at least 11 climbers have died while scaling the world’s tallest mountain, the latest a 62-year-old Colorado attorney who had reached the peak and was starting his descent, which can be just as dangerous.
"On the way down, I was trying to suck oxygen, and there wasn’t enough there," remembers Schauer. At one point he slipped and found himself dangling from a rope. "I’m looking out at the Himalayas upside-down," he says. He somehow managed to get a grip with the crampons on his boots digging into the ice, pulled himself up and made it safely back to base camp.
A climber at crowded Everest last week told CNN about having to step over dead bodies on the path. Schauer, whose first Everest attempt in 2014 was canceled after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas, says he didn’t see any bodies during his successful climb two years later. Some critics have blamed the deaths during this climbing season, which ended this week, on the growing number of climbers. Many are unprepared, and the crowding is caused by an increase in the number of companies leading the expeditions.
"Is it hubris? Might be. Is it bad preparation? Might be. Is it the line? Might be," Schauer says, adding that changing the protocol to call for more oxygen for the trip down from the summit might help. A story in The New York Times on Wednesday says Nepalese officials are considering changes that would bar inexperienced climbers and make it more difficult to get a permit.
Whether going up or down, the process is slow and tedious and climbers have to maneuver past each other. "You have to do the Everest dance," Schauer says, describing the process of moving along the guide rope. "You unclip, move, reclip, move. You’re clipping and unclipping 10,000 times."
And when you are exhausted, dealing with the altitude, short on air, and numb from the cold, it’s difficult to improvise.
"It’s really hard to get off that line. There’s nowhere to go," Schauer says. "You’re limited to the slowest person in line."
Schauer and his wife, Kathy, parents of three grown children, Jennifer, Melissa and Jake, became grandparents a week ago with the birth of Addison Grace to Jake and Elizabeth Schauer. Earlier in the year, Joel Schauer reached another milestone when he climbed to the top of Aconcagua in Argentina, making him just the 48th person to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents and ski to both the North and South poles.
The lessons he learns from climbing about building strong teams, planning well and taking "intelligent risks" help him run his business, Schauer says. Everest will always be one of his major accomplishments, but he doesn’t see the need to climb it again. His daughter Jennifer is going to run a not-for-profit for abused girls in Kathmandu, the Nepal city where most Everest climbers embark on their adventure. But Schauer says, "you can climb an equally beautiful mountain without so many people on it."
Considering all his world-famous climbs, ask him about what he is most proud of, and Schauer breaks into a big smile.
"That’s easy," Schauer says. "My granddaughter."

Texto completo: Almost two years in, there's no doubt the #MeToo movement has brought about change. Women have felt empowered to tell their stories, and companies have shepherded improvements to their harassment policies. Men in a variety of fields — more than 200 by one count — have faced some form of punishment for behavior that ranged from the despicable to the abominable.
For months their tumble from grace headlined the news cycle. Now the latest to face allegations of sexual misconduct is self-help guru Tony Robbins. Last week, four women — a former personal assistant and three followers — accused him of groping them, making unwanted advances or exposing himself. He's denied the charges.
But like all crusades, #MeToo has had its unintended consequences — reactions that are proving counterproductive and detrimental. According to a just-released study by LeanIn.org, 60% of male managers say they're uncomfortable interacting with women at work. That's almost double the percentage who, in 2018, said they were hesitant to mentor, socialize and meet one-on-one with women. Senior male managers were also nine times more likely to hesitate about traveling with a woman and six times more likely to reconsider having a work dinner.
Wow.
Anyone who has toiled outside the home knows that mentoring is important and personal meetings essential to build a career and climb the corporate ladder. When opportunities for this kind of interaction are unavailable, employees suffer. This is particularly true for women, who historically have not had an inside track to promotions.
As LeanIn.org founder and Facebook exec Sheryl Sandberg pointed out in a CBS interview, it's not enough to stop the harassment. "You need to not ignore us either."
The survey results shouldn't be a total surprise, though. Late last year, Bloomberg News published an article about how male finance executives said they were refusing to dine alone with women, leaving the door open during one-on-one meetings and even staying on different floors in hotels during business trips. A piece in the New York Times quoted men at the World Economic Forum who said they were so scared of being accused that they no longer planned to mentor women. In a field where women executives are as rare as an Amur leopard, this kind of segregation guarantees one thing: Fewer women will advance.
These reactions aren't unique. Worries over the #MeToo fallout also come from an unlikely demographic: professional women who happen to be the mothers of sons.
"I'm telling them to not be alone with a female colleague," confessed a friend, a mother of three sons and manager at a large nonprofit. "And if they have to, they need to make sure there's another person in the room. I don't want them to get into a he-said-she-said situation."
I understand her concerns perfectly. They coincide with my own. While action against the guilty should be decisive and swift, we shouldn't rush to judgment. Even Bill Cosby deserved his day in court, and we must be mindful that a false accusation can ruin a career, the fog of doubt lingering long after someone has been cleared. Like my friend, I'd like to think I've taught my four sons well and that they practice what I've preached. Think of how you want your sister treated, I've told them, again and again. Every woman is someone's daughter. R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
But part of the problem of the #MeToo movement has been that the media, as well as women, haven't always distinguished between foolish stumbles and the sort of serial dangerous harassment of which Harvey Weinstein has been accused. There are several shades of gray between misread signals and fearing for your job. Making them equivalent lessens the power of the #MeToo platform.
This is not to say that sexual harassment should be acceptable. It never is. But women must clearly and publicly differentiate between a misinterpreted pass and outright intimidation, between juvenile double entendres and coercion. And men ... well, they must step up to do what's right, not just by holding harassers accountable but by giving the same opportunities to all employees, regardless of sex.
Avoidance has never solved a single problem.

Texto completo: My storytelling journey has taken me down many fascinating roads, and none has been more meaningful to me than my next book: "Before and After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society."
I'm excited to tell you about "Before and After": a nonfiction book co-authored with friend and bestselling author Lisa Wingate, to be released by Random House on October 22 in hardcover, audio and e-book formats.
Lisa wrote "Before We Were Yours," which has sold more than 1.5 million copies and just came out in paperback last week. Two years ago, when I read an early copy of that novel, I mentioned here that it was one of the best books I'd read in a long time — in part because it was inspired by a piece of little-known and gripping Southern history and Lisa had written such a compelling fictionalized account.
The background
From the 1920s through 1950, a woman named Georgia Tann ran a black-market baby business at the Tennessee Children's Home Society in Memphis. She offered up more than 5,000 "orphans" tailored to the wish lists of eager parents — hiding the fact that many weren't orphans at all, but stolen sons and daughters of poor families, desperate single mothers and women told in maternity words that their babies died.
I could not have imagined how "Before We Were Yours" would touch my life, leading to intense research into Tann's horrible deeds and, amazingly, leading me to become friends with some of the incredible victims of the notorious scandal.
The power of story
Clearly other book lovers felt the same way I did about "Before We Were Yours." The novel stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for more than a year and was voted top work of historical fiction on Goodreads in 2017, with more than 200,000 votes. It has been published in more than 35 countries and optioned for film by MGM. (For more on Lisa: www.LisaWingate.com)
For a novel, that is almost unbelievable. But then something even more phenomenal happened: Fact met fiction.
That's where I come in.
The publication of "Before We Were Yours" brought new awareness of Tann's lucrative and shameful career in child trafficking. Adoptees who knew little about their pasts gained insight into the startling facts behind their family histories and began to contact Lisa, setting out to trace their roots and find their families.
In one of our regular telephone visits, Lisa asked if I might be interested in helping plan a reunion in Memphis last summer and preserving these amazing stories with the reporting skills I honed right here in North Louisiana.
What a blessing to be allowed the privilege of preserving these poignant stories and getting to know adoptees and their families from Utah to New York to Arkansas and Tennessee and beyond. They are awesome folks, and I can't wait for you to read about them. In all, we profile 15 adoptees and tell the moving and sometimes shocking ways in which they were separated from their birth families. Often raised by older parents as only children, many have joyfully reunited with siblings in the final decades of their lives.
In "Before and After," Lisa and I write of first family meetings that are all the sweeter and more intense for time missed, and of families from very different social backgrounds reaching out to embrace brothers, sisters and cousins.
In a culmination of art-meets-life, long silent victims of the corrupt system returned to Memphis with Lisa and me to reclaim their stories at a Tennessee Children's Home Society reunion ... with what I can tell you were startling and emotional results.
The book is available for pre-order from your favorite booksellers, including at Amazon and Barnes & Noble Booksellers, and I look forward to visiting with you about it in person in the fall.

Navy pilots claim UFO sightings; Unidentified objects seen flying up to 30,000 feet

Texto completo: Pilots part of the VFA-11 "Red Rippers" fighter squadron out of Naval Air Station Oceana have begun speaking up about UFOs they claim to have seen from Virginia to Florida starting about five years ago. The pilots appear in a six-part History Channel series premiering Friday called "Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation."
Lieutenants Ryan Graves and Danny Accoin, both F/A-18 Super Hornet pilots, recently told the New York Times they've seen unidentified objects that they cannot explain flying up to 30,000 feet. The strange objects appeared almost daily and had no exhaust or engine plumes, the Times reported.
"These things would be out there all day," Graves told the Times. "Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we'd expect."
Navy representatives did not respond to questions from The Virginian-Pilot on Wednesday.
The accounts come a month after the Navy acknowledged that it drafted new rules for reporting such sightings. Reports documented "unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years," officials said in a statement to Politico, which first reported the changes.
Graves' experiences started in summer 2014, he told the Times, when the squadron was training off the USS Theodore Roosevelt.
Objects, which the pilots would first ignore as false radar tracks, showed up from sea level to up to 30,000 feet, sometimes at hypersonic speeds, the Times reported.
Accoin told the newspaper he once set his plane to merge with the object.
"He should have been able to see it with his helmet camera, but could not, even though his radar told him it was there," the Times wrote.
The pilots assumed the objects were part of a drone program, but started to doubt that when one, that looked "like a sphere encasing a tube," nearly collided with a pilot one day off the coast of Virginia Beach.
They also noticed the objects could make sudden stops, starts and turns at hypersonic speed - something humans physically can't do. But they don't make any claims to know what they are.
"We're here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths," Accoin told the Times.
A declassified video of one 2015 incident, taken aboard a Super Hornet near the Florida coast, shows an unidentified, rotating object in the pilot's line of sight above the clouds. "Look at that thing!" a pilot says.
Another video, taken at 25,000 feet aboard a fighter jet from the Roosevelt, shows a pilot trying to capture an object.
"Whoa, got it!" he says. "What the (expletive) is that thing?"
The military calls the objects unidentified aerial phenomena.
The Pentagon first confirmed the existence of its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which investigates UFO reports, in 2017 in response to a Times investigation.
That program, the Times reported, has also studied a 2004 incident in which two Navy jets encountered what pilots described as a giant white Tic Tac flying off the San Diego coast.

Universities Contest Granting of Anonymity In Sexual Assault Suits

Texto completo: The former college student said she had been raped three times as an undergraduate at Florida A&M University, twice by students and once by an acquaintance who was on campus regularly.
She withdrew from the university and filed suit, saying that campus officials did not do enough to investigate the claims and protect her from being attacked again and again. As a precaution, she identified herself in public court papers only as S.B.
Her school fired back three times with a demand for the court: Reveal her full name or toss out the case.
For years, students have filed sexual assault complaints under pseudonyms, which allow them to seek justice without shame or fear of being targeted. Universities have generally accepted the practice.
But in two recent lawsuits -- S.B.'s case against Florida A&M University and a suit by nine women against Dartmouth College -- the schools have demanded that students publicly reveal their identities, going against longstanding legal practice intended to protect plaintiffs in sensitive disputes.
Experts on sexual assault cases say that these demands amount to a newly aggressive stance by universities that face potentially damaging lawsuits, and that they run counter to the spirit of federal civil rights policies. The identities of the women in both cases are known to the university lawyers, but not to the public.
"What you're seeing in this particular case is real hardball," said Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who typically represents men accused of sexual assault. "And it's still not the way most lawyers or schools handle it. They're a little bit more gracious about protecting someone who was their student."
On Wednesday, S.B.'s lawyer sent a letter to more than 40 state legislators objecting to the university's tactics and asking them to investigate the matter.
Florida A&M, a renowned historically black college in Tallahassee, Fla., said that it was "merely asking for a fair and open trial," and that this required "that her legal name be provided to jurors at trial." It said that its demands were in line with those of many other colleges and universities, and that it took all allegations of sexual assault seriously.
With the rise of the #MeToo movement, women have become bolder about using their names in retellings of traumatic sexual experiences and in sexual assault cases. But many still fear the stigma that may come with going public.
The legal efforts to unmask women in sexual assault cases come as the federal Education Department is in the final stages of reviewing some 120,000 comments about Secretary Betsy DeVos's proposed new rules under Title IX, the federal law forbidding sex discrimination. The new rules were intended in part to address criticism that those accused of sexual assault were not given due process.
Florida A&M has tried through two motions to have S.B.'s lawsuit dismissed unless her name is disclosed, and again most recently in an appeal, which is pending.
The university said that allowing S.B. to use her initials makes her appear to be a victim who needs protection, even though that has not been proved in court. It argued that it was only fair for S.B. to be publicly identified because she was publicly identifying the university officials who she said had mishandled her case, and the men who she said had raped her.
The judge, Mark E. Walker of the Northern District of Florida, did not agree. "Outing an alleged rape victim simply because other parties or individuals involved in the lawsuit are not proceeding anonymously serves no legitimate public interest," he said in his decision on one of Florida A&M's motions.
S.B.'s lawyer, Michael Dolce, said there was no comparison between the stigma and shame a victim of sexual assault can face and the embarrassment endured by a university official accused of bureaucratic mistakes. The school's efforts, he added, were intended to intimidate the woman into dropping her suit.
S.B. declined a request to talk about the case on Wednesday, even without using her full name, saying she was "just too afraid," according to her lawyer.
In what critics saw as a similar legal strategy, Dartmouth has objected to allowing some of the women who are suing it in a sexual assault case to be identified as Jane Does. In that case, the plaintiffs are accusing three professors of turning a human behavior research department into what they call "a 21st-century Animal House," where they say they were "leered at, groped, sexted, intoxicated and even raped." Dartmouth has said the lawsuit mischaracterizes its actions.
The university argued in court papers that because some of the six named plaintiffs had sought publicity, granting interviews with news outlets including The New York Times, it did not make sense for the three other plaintiffs to be identified only as Jane Does.
Justin Anderson, a spokesman for Dartmouth, said on Wednesday that its case was different from the Florida A&M case because it involved a class-action lawsuit, where, he said, it was typical to challenge anonymity. He said that protecting the anonymity of the plaintiffs would hamper the university's ability to determine whether they could represent a class.
"To compare our approach to Florida A & M's is apples to oranges," he said, adding that Dartmouth supported the right of women to file anonymously if they filed as individuals.
The plaintiffs said that at least two of the anonymous women had already suffered from "extreme emotional distress ranging from depression to suicidal thoughts," and that outing them would only traumatize them more.
"Dartmouth's objection is a striking departure for a liberal, Ivy League institution that touts itself as being 'at the forefront of public conversations on women, gender and sexuality issues,"' the plaintiffs said in court papers.
The judge has not ruled on whether real names should be required in the Dartmouth case, and in the meantime, both sides have agreed to mediation.
But the dispute has caused a furor among students and alumni. "The idea that you're going to out people is so dangerous," said Ruth Cserr, 53, who graduated in 1988. "I'm just disgusted."
Diana Whitney, 45, of the Class of 1995, said alumni had been following the case closely and circulating a hashtag, #DartmouthDoBetter. "That's how we feel every time we see a new legal filing," Ms. Whitney said.
Several lawyers said that universities had a special responsibility to protect the confidentiality of their students in Title IX cases like these.
Mr. Dolce, S.B.'s lawyer, said that it was hypocritical for the university to allow confidentiality when a sexual assault is reported, but not when the university is being sued. Florida A&M "in no uncertain terms told her, 'We are going to protect your identity,"' he said.
Florida A&M students said on Wednesday that disclosing the identities of anonymous plaintiffs posed a safety issue.
"You are going to out her to the public, which includes people who are against survivors," said Aiyana Ishmael, 20, a student who said she had interviewed students about sexual violence for an assignment last year. "It feels like she is being attacked after the fact."
Maya Porter, 19, a junior who works with Planned Parenthood Generation Action, a national campus advocacy organization, said that people did not realize the psychological harm inflicted by outing victims. "Unless a victim volunteers their name," she said, "it should not be used."

Texto completo: Flooding along the Mississippi River is the worst it’s been since 1927. More than 50 tornadoes touched down during the Memorial Day weekend. In Denver, it snowed more than three inches last week.
Climate scientists say this is only the beginning of what will be decades of increasingly dangerous and damaging extreme weather – and there’s no question that much of it’s being driven by global warming.
The scientific data is too clear and too overwhelming to come to any other conclusion, said Richard Rood, a meteorologist and professor of climate research at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
The coherent and convergent data signals climate scientists across the globe are seeing “make it extraordinarily unlikely that this is just a set of typical weather events that just happen to occur at the same time,” Rood said.
Odds of dangerous weather increasing
Global warming has already increased the odds of record hot and wet events happening in 75% of North America, said Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor of climate science at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.
For dry events such as droughts, it’s 50% of North America, said Diffenbaugh, who has provided testimony and scientific expertise on climate change to the White House, the governor of California and U. S. congressional offices.
The scientific evidence is not strong enough for a definitive link between global warming and the kinds of severe thunderstorms that produce tornadoes.
The Fourth National Climate Assessment released in November found that as the planet warms because of human-caused climate change, heavy downpours are increasing in the Midwest. From the early 1990s to the mid-2010s, very heavy precipitation events in the Midwest increased by 37%. The 1,500-page congressionally mandated report was produced by the U. S. Global Change Research Program.
The report said "an increase in localized extreme precipitation and storm events can lead to an increase in flooding. River flooding in large rivers like the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries can flood surface streets and low-lying areas, resulting in drinking water contamination, evacuations, damage to buildings, injury, and death. "
The United States is seeing clear increases in historical terms of severe heat, heavy rainfalls and storm-surge flooding.
“There are also many different individual extreme events for which we have robust evidence of an influence of historical global warming on the probability and/or severity of that particular event,” said Diffenbaugh.
Those events include the hot, dry summer over the central United States in 2012 that led to severe declines in crop yields, the recent California drought that lasted seven years, the storm-surge flooding during Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and the record rainfall delivered to Houston by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, said Diffenbaugh.
In the Midwest, the characteristics of winters are changing, they’re getting warmer and wetter, followed by large amounts of spring rain.
“That’s a formula for flooding. You’re about to see the Mississippi enter into its longest-duration flood. You’re seeing remarkable duration in the flooding on many Midwestern rivers,” said Rood.
Only the beginning
Heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels are the cause of the higher temperatures.
The extra carbon dioxide has caused temperatures to rise to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors, scientists report. And humans have increased the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began, according to NASA.
The Earth’s average temperature has already increased by 1. 4 degrees since 1880, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory.
“We are at the beginning of what’s going to be a number of decades where the climate is going to be changing very fast. During that time we will have many unexpected weather events,” said Rood.
This comes as the White House plans to stop reporting on the effects of global warming past 2040 rather than through the end of the century as was previously the case, according to a report this week in The New York Times.
Scientists say this is misleading because the climate models show the largest effects of global warming hitting after 2040 unless carbon emissions are decreased.
“They well know that if we fail to act to bring down our carbon emissions over the next decade, this will lock in disastrous melting of the ice sheets, sea-level rise, and a rise in devastating weather extremes decades down the road,” said Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University.
The Environmental Protection Agency responded to the Times report by saying that the previous use of inaccurate modeling focused on worst-case emission scenarios didn’t reflect real-world conditions and needed to be “thoroughly re-examined and tested. ”
In fact, Mann said, it’s an effort to misrepresent and downplay the seriousness of the problem in service of the fossil fuel interests to which he and others believe the Trump administration is beholden.

Texto completo: Tiffany Haddish is trading in her trademark humor for teary-eyed vulnerability.
The comedian got emotional when she opened up about her childhood relationship with her mother in a conversation with David Letterman in an episode of his Netflix interview show, "My Next Guest Needs No Introduction," which arrives on the streaming service Friday.
Haddish, 39, detailed how a head injury "changed everything" about her mom, Leola.
"When I was 8, about to be 9, she had a car accident and her head went through a windshield," Haddish said. "By the grace of God she lived, but she had to learn how to walk, talk, eat, everything all over again. "
Re-learning those basic tasks wasn't the only way the accident affected Haddish's mom.
"I didn't want to be with my mom no more," Haddish said. "She had became very violent and very verbally abusive. You never knew who she was going to be. Every day was like a different day. "
Haddish continued: "I used to be begging my mom if I could go live with my grandma. And my mom would yell, 'She's not your momma, I'm your momma!' "
The "Girls Trip" star got choked up recalling her family struggles.
"I used to think she was demonized. I thought like maybe someone else jumped inside her body, like 'Where's my mommy?' She's gone. "
Haddish previously spoke about her mother's accident in her autobiography, "The Last Black Unicorn," and told The New York Times that her stepfather told her he tampered with the brakes on her mother’s car to injure her family, but instead left her mother with severe brain injuries. Haddish and her siblings ended up in the foster care system.
Other guests in the second season of Letterman's new talk show are Kanye West, Ellen DeGeneres, Melinda Gates and Lewis Hamilton.

Nagle's in Ocean Grove closes, may reopen 'when time is right,' owner says

Texto completo: For nearly two decades, the year-round Nagle's Apothecary Cafe came to life in summertime, when customers filled the counters and lined up at the ice cream window for a sundae or a shake.
But the historic building at Main and Central avenues, just a few blocks from the beach, will remain dark this season. The restaurant, which opened in 2000, has been closed since January due to an owner's illness, and owner Lenny Steen told The Coaster that Nagle's would not be open this summer due to personal reasons.
"I do not intend to sell the building and, when the time is right, we will reopen," he told The Coaster, adding that he hopes to reopen Nagle's within a year. "I can't wait to come back, and I want to thank every person in Ocean Grove who sent us letters, cards, or just came knocking on the door saying thank you."
The news of the restaurant's closure follows the recent loss of another Ocean Grove landmark. In April, a five-alarm fire demolished a beachfront pavilion beneath the Dunes Boardwalk Cafe; see a gallery of the fire's damage in the gallery below. The fire destroyed the cafe, which housed Playa Bowls, Bubbakoo's Burritos, America's Cup Coffee and Day's Ice Cream, as well as neighboring shops Jones Treasure Grove, Maxie's Tops & Tees, A Promised Land and Bettie's Bombshells.
Customers, some of whom remember when Nagles was a pharmacy (it originally opened in the early 1900s), were saddened to hear the news:
"I sat at the lunch counter 58 years ago and would buy cherry Cokes for 10 cents," Bob Brennecke shared on social media. "The pharmacist, Mr. Holl, would open up the RX counter for an hour or so on Sundays so folks could get any needed medicines (and, of course, we would buy a few penny candies). Not the Nagles I remember as a child, but I visited a couple of years ago with family and had a splendid lunch."
"I'm so, so sorry to hear that illness within the family will keep the doors closed this season," Corey Ayala Fagundez wrote. "I'm hoping ... that Nagle's will open again when and if the family feels ready. The business will be missed by so many if they decide the load is too heavy and do not reopen."
"I hope that the place won't just sit dormant, that either the owners can hand it over to someone else to run the show until things get better or that they sell to someone who will respect the menu and the history," Lisa Tatulis Courtney wrote. "Nagle's itself is a part of Ocean Grove history, but the apothecary cafe has been so important to OG for nearly 20 years. It would be a shame for that to just end. I hope for the best for the owners, as the whole place has been a labor of love for them, and they're really nice guys."
In 2005, The New York Times visited Nagle's for a story on Ocean Grove, a community that officially is part of Neptune Township and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places for nearly half a century. "Leonard Steen, proprietor of Nagle's Apothecary Cafe, a pharmacy-turned-restaurant on Main Avenue in Ocean Grove, N.J., takes new hires to the graves of the former owners of the building, which was built in the 1880s," the newspaper wrote. " 'I show them that real people dedicated their lives to this place,' he said. 'You aren't working for a giant corporation that claims to be 'your neighborhood bar and grill.' "
Sarah Griesemer joined the Press more than 15 years ago and has held a variety of positions since, but the work she does now is her favorite: food writing. Her favorite stories to write are the ones that make a difference for the Shore's mom and pop restaurants. Write to her at sgriesemer@gannettnj.com and follow @jersey.shore.eats.
Despite these signs on the front door of Nagle's in Ocean Grove, owners say that due to an illness, their restaurant will not open this summer.

Texto completo: Celebrating its 40th anniversary of recognizing Mississippi's artists, writers, and musicians, the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters announces this year's winners for works first published, performed, or shown in 2018. The award winners, chosen by out-of-state judges prominent in their fields, will be honored at the 40th Anniversary Awards Gala on June 8, in Meridian at the Mississippi Arts+Entertainment Experience.
The Noel Polk Lifetime Achievement Award winner is John Ruskey. Described by Southern Living as an "environmental evangelist for the wonders of the Mississippi River," Ruskey is a musician, writer, diarist, watercolorist, canoe maker, and river guide. A graduate of St. John's College with a Philosophy of Mathematics degree and of the University of Vermont with a B.A. in English and music, this Colorado native moved to Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1991 to become the first curator of the Delta Blues Museum. While there, he founded the Delta Blues Education Fund, a non-profit that pairs area children with master Delta blues musicians to continue the tradition of Delta Blues. He established Quapaw Canoe Company in 1998 to provide guided expeditions of the Lower Mississippi RIver and some of its tributaries and has become the most knowledgeable guide on the Lower Mississippi River.
Square Books of Oxford is a winner of an MIAL Citation of Merit in recognition of its forty years of contributing to the literary life of Mississippi. Opened in September, 1979, by Lisa and Richard Howorth, Square Books quickly established itself as a center of reading and writing for the state. Originally focused on the literature of Mississippi and the South, the small bookstore grew to three storefronts and a wide selection of books on all topics. Its earliest signing event was for Mississippi novelist Ellen Douglas followed the next month by Mississippi poet Etheridge Knight. The arrival of Bill Ferris and Willie Morris to Oxford opened the doors for many other prominent authors to visit the new store. Square Books now hosts over 150 events a year including Thacker Mountain Radio and signings for the Oxford Conference for the Book. It has become an essential stop on book tours and thus provides Mississippians the opportunity to meet and hear prominent authors weekly.
Winner of the Contemporary Music Composition Award is John Milham for Arden's Garden. A culmination of twenty years of recording and traveling the world as a professional musician, this album is a blend of avant-garde jazz, blues, New Orleans funk, and electronica. Milham, who studied at Berklee College of Music, plays with his own band, the Inner Mission Band, as well as performing with other groups such as Molly Thomas and the Rare Birds, Johnny Sansone, and the Bodhi Trio.
Steve Rouse, a native of Moss Point and currently Professor of Theory and Composition at the University of Louisville School of Music, is the winner of the Classical Music Composition Award for This Dream. A Rome Prize winner, Rouse has also won an NEA Composition Fellowship, two awards from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, three Al Smith Fellowships, and a Meet the Composer Residency. While serving as Composer in Residence for Meet the Composer, he composed music for all levels of public school music ensembles and developed musical outreach programming. Rouse received his B.M. degree from the University of Southern Mississippi and both a master's and doctorate from the University of Michigan.
The Fiction Award goes to Tiffany Quay Tyson for "The Past Is Never," a Southern Gothic novel combining local legends, magical realism, family secrets, and the search for a missing child. A faculty member at Lighthouse Writers Workshop and the Lighthouse Young Writers Program, Tyson is a native of Jackson and a graduate of Delta State University. Her first novel was Three Rivers, and she has also published pieces of short fiction and humor. She worked briefly in the Mississippi Delta as a journalist and received the Frank Allen Award for Journalism.
Julian Rankin of Ocean Springs is the winner of the Nonfiction Award for "Catfish Dream: Ed Scott's Fight for His Family Farm and Racial Justice in the Mississippi Delta." His work tells the biography of a person and a place as it explores Scott's life as a farmer and the first nonwhite owner and operator of a catfish plant in the nation. A native Mississippian, Rankin received his degree in English and Creative writing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He currently serves as the Executive Director of the Walter Anderson Museum of Art and was the founding Director of the Mississippi Museum of Art's Center for Art and Public Exchange, which uses artworks to address issues of racial equity and to create new narratives in modern Mississippi.
The Poetry Award winner is Aimee Nezhukumatathil for her work Oceanic, described by the publisher as "a sensuous love song to the earth and its inhabitants describing what it means to love a world in peril." A professor of English in the MFA program at the University of Mississippi, Nezhukumatathil is the author of four books of poetry and a winner of the Pushcart Prize and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts among other honors. Her poems and essays have appeared in Ploughshares, Poetry, Tin House, Best American Poetry anthology, and other publications.
Rory Doyle of Cleveland is the winner of the Photography Award for Delta Hill RIders, his ongoing project on African-American cowboys and cowgirls. The project, which sheds light on a band of horse riders historically overlooked, was featured in the Half King Photo Series in New York and in The Print Space Gallery in London. A graduate of Delta State University, Doyle was the recipient of the 2019 Zeiss Photography Award, and he won the 16th Annual Smithsonian Photo Contest. Doyle is a 2019 Mississippi Visual Arts Fellow through the Mississippi Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts.
The Visual Arts Award winner is Coulter Fussell of Water Valley for New Work-Textiles. Working out of her studio/workshop/quilting supply shop called YaloRUN, Fussell produces her textile art that often combines quilting and painting. Fussell"s work combines the freedom of contemporary painting with the order of operations and functionality of traditional quilting. It has been featured in Art Forum and in the New York Times. Fussell received her B.F.A. from the University of Mississippi.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Two years ago, the author Michael Wolff parlayed his access to one of President Trump's most powerful advisers, Stephen K. Bannon, into "Fire and Fury," a rollicking, behind-the-scenes account of Mr. Trump's chaotic White House. The book sold more than four million copies, despite lingering questions about its accuracy.
Now, Mr. Wolff is back with a sequel, "Siege: Trump Under Fire," which appears to rely just as heavily on Mr. Bannon. But the author's source left the White House in August 2017 and has watched Mr. Trump's circuslike presidency from afar since. That gives the disclosures in Mr. Wolff's latest book a secondhand feeling -- and one of his most sensational claims drew a quick, emphatic rebuttal.
A spokesman for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, denied Mr. Wolff's claim that in March 2018, Mr. Mueller was preparing to indict the president for obstruction of justice on three counts, including witness tampering. Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller's prosecutors, whom Mr. Wolff says led that effort, did not even work on the part of the investigation that focused on obstruction.
In an author's note, Mr. Wolff said his account of Mr. Mueller's investigation was based on "internal documents given to me by sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel." But in a rare on-the-record denial, the special counsel's spokesman, Peter Carr, said on Tuesday that "the documents described do not exist."
Mr. Wolff responded in an interview, "My source is impeccable, and I have no doubt about the authenticity and the significance of the documents."
The criticism of his work puts Mr. Wolff in a familiar position. The White House lashed out after the publication of "Fire and Fury," calling it "trashy tabloid fiction." A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, tried to block its publication and threatened to sue the publisher, Henry Holt & Company, for libel. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that the book was "full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist."
Copies of "Siege" have begun circulating in advance of its publication on June 4, and The New York Times obtained one. But the disclosures in the book, first reported on Tuesday by The Guardian, did not provoke the storm of coverage on social media and cable television that helped propel the sales of Mr. Wolff's last book into the stratosphere.
That may reflect both the questions of accuracy that hung over "Fire and Fury" and a growing jadedness with inside accounts of the Trump White House. Bob Woodward's best-selling book "Fear" and other accounts have depicted a now-familiar tableau of hapless, scheming aides and an impulsive, erratic president distracted by his legal battles and obsessed with the talking heads on Fox News.
For his first book, Mr. Wolff spent time in the West Wing, often in Mr. Bannon's office. He does not claim to have had similar access this time, noting that many of his original sources have left the White House.
In his author's note, Mr. Wolff acknowledged that those sources were not trustworthy. "For the writer," he said, "interviewing such Janus-faced sources creates a dilemma, for it requires depending on people who lie to also tell the truth -- and who might later disavow the truth they have told."
Mr. Wolff is open about his reliance on Mr. Bannon, whom he thanks in the acknowledgments, describing him as "the most cleareyed interpreter of the Trump phenomenon I know" and "the Virgil anyone might be lucky to have as a guide for a descent into Trumpworld."
Even after Mr. Bannon left the White House, Mr. Wolff said he exercised considerable power over the president's agenda. He helped push Mr. Trump into declaring a national emergency to obtain funding for his border wall. Although he quotes Mr. Bannon as saying that Mr. Trump is "not the billionaire he said he was, just another scumbag," he also thought constantly about going back to him.
The Mueller investigation forms the centerpiece of the book, and Mr. Wolff offers an unusual glimpse into the grand jury, which has heard testimony under a veil of secrecy for months.
"The Mueller grand jurors were more female than male," he wrote, "more white than black, older rather than younger; they were distinguished most of all by their intensity and focus."
But Mr. Wolff's account of the purported draft indictment contained several puzzling elements. He quoted the title of the draft as "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA - against - DONALD J. TRUMP Defendant," while the usual formulation would be to use the abbreviation "v." for versus, not "against." All of the indictments secured by the special counsel use "v."
Moreover, the purported document says that Mr. Trump could be indicted under three obstruction of justice laws, known as Section 1505, Section 1512 and Section 1513 of Title 18 of the United States code.
Yet around that time, a representative of Mr. Mueller's told Mr. Trump's legal team that the president was not under investigation under Section 1505, but rather only under Section 1512, according to a person briefed on that conversation. Mr. Mueller's representative did not bring up Section 1513, the person said.
That exchange took place after Mr. Trump's legal team sent Mr. Mueller a letter arguing that Mr. Trump could not have committed obstruction of justice, raising arguments focused exclusively on a technical problem raised by the wording of Section 1505. In response, a representative of Mr. Mueller's office told Mr. Trump's lawyers that they were focused on the wrong law, the person said, and should instead look at Section 1512.
Mr. Wolff portrayed Mr. Weissmann as bitterly disappointed by his boss's refusal to indict the president. But Mr. Weissmann focused on the case against Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's campaign chairman, and other defendants. Two other lawyers, James L. Quarles III and Andrew D. Goldstein, were primarily involved in looking at whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction.
On more minor details, Mr. Wolff's book has the same hit-or-miss quality. Mr. Trump did refer to one of his lawyers, Ty Cobb, as Cy Young -- either deliberately or accidentally using the name of another baseball great for his lawyer's namesake.
But Mr. Wolff also claims that Attorney General William P. Barr viewed taking his job as a "payday," calculating that if he managed to avoid both a constitutional crisis and the destruction of the Republican Party, "there were many, many future millions in it for him."
Friends of Mr. Barr's said that claim was ludicrous. A 69-year-old former corporate lawyer, Mr. Barr listed more than $ 22 million in assets and income on his financial disclosure form.
"He needed another stint in government like he needed a root canal," said Jonathan Turley, a longtime friend and professor at George Washington University Law School.

Texto completo: Did the Democrats pick the wrong electoral cycle to jump their particular abortion-cheering, fetus-destroying, and sensibility-unsettling shark? For a certain kind of Republican voter, who has problems with Donald Trump’s temperament and with the programmatic agenda of the national Democrats, the decision to vote”‘no” on the Democrats and on their agenda just got a whole lot easier.
For years, the polling in the U.S. and the world has been unchanged and unchanging: 60% or so of respondents support permitting abortion in the first trimester, 30% or so in the second, and down to the low teens in the third. For years, presidential candidates on both sides have threaded the needle, appeasing the base while giving those who dissent leeway enough to vote for them anyhow. Then, sometime in the winter of 2018, the needles were tossed, the goalposts upended, and the word went forth to any Democrat even dreaming of running for office that the new rules were unquestioned support for all abortions anywhere under any conditions, to the moment of birth and beyond.
“The changed composition of the Supreme Court and the supposed imminent danger that [Roe v. Wade] will be overturned is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway,” George Will informs us. Their aim is “to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother’s stomach.”
The question now is how these views may play out against a highly beatable Republican candidate. But haven’t we seen this same story before?
It was 2016 when Hillary Clinton, our first female nominee, ran for president with a more aggressive and rigorous abortion rights platform than had been seen in a major party’s agenda before. Gone was her husband’s abortion rights platform of “safe, legal, and rare." Gone were the moral concerns voiced by Obama. In their place was was her dictum that pro-life sentiments should never be voiced in her party at all.
The first candidate openly endorsed by Planned Parenthood, Hillary barnstormed with its statuesque leader, surrounded by mobs of overbearing and shrieking young women, holding boisterous rallies throughout the Midwest.
Then with the election, the verdict came due: “Hillary Clinton lost the overall Catholic vote by seven points — after President Obama had won it in the previous two elections,” wrote Thomas Groome in the New York Times over two years ago. “In heavily Catholic states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, she lost by a hair — the last by less than 1 percent. A handful more of Catholic votes per parish in those states would have won her the election.”
What 2016 proved is that people will vote for someone they don’t like if the opposition is made to seem even less attractive. That’s precisely what the Left’s new approach to abortion is likely to do. In 2016, Will says, ”[Democrats] produced a candidate whom Donald Trump defeated by 17 points among the 18 percent of voters who had negative views of both him and her. ... he won by 51 points among the 15 percent of the electorate who thought neither was qualified to be president.”
Voters have proved that they will vote for Trump. He was elected by people who didn't much like him. Will this be the result in the 2020 election? We’ll see.

Texto completo: “¡Wow, qué es eso, hombre!”, exclamó un piloto, “¡mira cómo vuela!”.
Objetos voladores no identificados (ovnis en español, ufos en inglés) fueron vistos casi a diario entre el verano de 2014 y la primavera de 2015 en los cielos de la Costa Este. Y los testigos no fueron personajes dudosos sino pilotos de élite de la Marina estadounidense , que lo reportaron a sus mandos en el Pentágono e incluso al Congreso.
“ Esas cosas estaban ahí fuera todo el dí a”, explica ahora uno de ellos, Ryan Graves, al diario The New York Times. “Mantener un avión en el aire requiere de una cantidad notable de energía; a la velocidad a la que los vimos, 12 horas en el aire son 11 horas más de las que esperaríamos”, explicó Graves.
Este piloto de cazabombarderos F/A-18, que lleva una década en la Marina, se refería a objetos no identificados de formas extrañas (uno parecía una peonza girando en contra del viento; otro parecía una pastilla contra la tos del tamaño de un avión comercial).
A veces, quedaban grabados en video. En al menos una ocasión, estuvieron a punto de colisionar en el aire contra los cazas de combate. No parece que tengan motor, pero pueden alcanzar los 30,000 pies de altura a velocidades supersónicas. Y nadie dice que sean extraterrestres , pero no siempre parece existir una explicación plausible.
Tanto Graves como otros cuatro pilotos con los que habló el citado diario insisten en que vieron esos objetos durante unas maniobras de entrenamiento con el portaviones Theodore Roosevelt sobre el cielo entre Virginia y Florida. No aportan eso sí ninguna posible explicación.
La Marina tampoco tiene una versión oficial, pero sí ha difundido este año un manual secreto sobre cómo reportar un encuentro de sus pilotos con un ovni.
En algunos casos puede tratarse de drones comerciales , explica un portavoz, Joseph Gradisher, pero en otras ocasiones “no sabemos quién está detrás, no tenemos suficiente información”.
Los avistamientos de 2015 y 2015 fueron reportados a un programa secreto poco conocido del Pentágono “para la identificación de amenazas aeroespaciales”. Su responsable, Luis Elizondo, dimitió en 2017 tras calificarlos como “una sorprendente serie de incidentes”.
Su origen extraterrestre “es tan improbable que compite con otras explicaciones también poco probables y más mundanas”, arguye Leon Golub, astrofísico del centro Harvard-Smithsonian.
Como posibles explicaciones señala a errores en los aparatos de detección de los aviones, efectos o reflejos atmosféricos, o incluso errores en los sentidos de los pilotos debidos a la abundancia de estímulos en un vuelo a alta velocidad.
“La gente lleva décadas viendo cosas extrañas desde aviones militares”, explica el piloto Ryan Graves, “ sería muy gordo que hubiera algo allí arriba”.
Su compañero Danny Accoin afirma que se cruzó en dos ocasiones con estos objetos, capaces de acelerar, frenar y volver a acelerar a velocidad supersónicas como ningún avión conocido .
La primera vez, apareció en su radar pero él no lo pudo ver. Unos días después, uno de sus misiles lo detectó como posible objetivo, y también apareció en su cámara de infrarrojos, aunque él tampoco pudo verlo .
Los pilotos especularon con la posibilidad de que pudiera tratarse de un programa secreto de aviones o drones de última generación.
Pero el hecho de que se rozara una catástrofe cuando uno de esos objetos (descrito por el piloto como una esfera con un cubo dentro) pasó junto a un avión convenció a los pilotos de que un programa así no se permitiría en una zona de maniobras por el peligro que entrañaría.
Además, los ovnis no se comportan como un avión normal. “ La velocidad no mata ”, explica Graves, “frenar o acelerar sí”. Estos objetos pasan de cero a velocidad supersónica de forma casi inmediata, y trazan curvas que van más allá de lo que un piloto podría resistir.
“Cuando la gente dice haber observado fenómenos realmente extraños, a veces vale la pena investigar en serio”, dice la astrofísica Sara Seager, pero “lo que la gente a veces no entiende sobre la ciencia es que a menudo tenemos fenómenos que siguen sin poder ser explicados ”

Texto completo: Last week, the New York Times did something I would have thought impossible: They made New Yorkers feel bad for cabdrivers. Until Uber and Lyft arrived on the scene, a surefire way to enliven a dull Manhattan dinner party was to broach the topic of taxis - never around when you need one, everyone would moan, and if you do finally luck out, you'll discover it's filthy and invariably driven by a maniac.
But as revealed by the Times investigation of lending practices in the business of buying and selling the medallions required for yellow cab ownership in New York - with prices reaching $1.3 million in 2013 - it turns out that the cabdrivers have their own tales of woe. Many of them took out high-six-figure loans to buy the medallions, on income that barely did more than cover the loan payments. Bad enough when taxi medallions were a scarce and valuable commodity; ruinous now that ride-hailing services have cut into their profits.
Yet, funnily enough, Uber and Lyft aren't doing so well either. Both companies recently went public, only to see their stock trade well below the IPO price. That's because the companies are burning great bonfires of investor cash every quarter, having so far failed to discover a working business model.
Uber and Lyft are discovering that the regulatory monopolies they smashed had existed for a reason. Before Uber's 2009 launch, and Lyft's a few years later, almost every sizable city tightly controlled its taxi market. Government commissions set fares and limited the supply of taxi licenses. These regulations existed because without government intervention, no one would make any money. In a country with tens of millions of driver's licenses, and automobiles to match, the supply of potential taxis far outstripped any possible consumer demand.
Virtually everything people hated about taxis stemmed from that underlying market problem and the regulatory apparatus that tried to fix it. Couldn't get a cab when you needed one? Taxi commissions were protecting incumbent profits by sharply limiting the number of licenses or medallions. Cabs were disgusting, and piloted through congested streets at death-defying speeds? Artificial scarcity normally drives up prices, so governments set regulated fares, usually by time and distance. There was no premium for a comfortable and soothing customer experience. Naturally, drivers focused on hauling the maximum number of people every shift.
Everyone complained about the result, but for decades, nothing ever changed. Then came Uber. The company did an end run around that regulatory stalemate, pushing into markets with better service and then daring the taxi commissions to shut them down.
Some cities did just that. But often, by the time the commissioners got around to it, Uber had acquired a rabid fan base, which the company wasn't shy about weaponizing. Amazingly, improbably, Uber broke the taxi commissions - and then broke the people who owned those previously valuable taxi medallions, from individual driver-owners to the operators of taxi fleets.
It was a triumph for libertarian ideals. For Uber's and Lyft's investors, however, it may have been an empty victory.
The companies' problems essentially boil down to this: The barriers to entry into the driving-people-around business are functionally nil. Whenever the profits in the market rise above a subsistence wage, more drivers will enter, thus competing those profits away.
That was the problem taxi medallions had been designed to solve. Drivers still didn't make much money, because all you needed to get started in the business was a driver's license. But the people who owned the right to drive were able to make a tidy living, with almost no downside risk. That's why New York City taxi medallions got so valuable: Two decades of low-interest rates made them an attractive alternative to bonds offering yields in the low single digits.
Then a hidden downside emerged, as ride-hailing companies disrupted that previously stable regulatory equilibrium. People who had bought into the medallion market at inflated prices saw the value of their assets crater, and many of them ended up insolvent.
But destroying a profitable business isn't the same thing as creating one. Without the regulatory monopoly they disrupted, how are Uber and Lyft going to make money?
They could try to replicate the monopoly, only without the governmental assist, exerting such firm control over the ride market that new competitors effectively can't enter. The other option: They can't. Uber and Lyft may discover, like taxi-medallion owners before them, that in this business, there's always another guy with a car waiting around the corner to overrun your seemingly impregnable market position.

Texto completo: Jamie Wesley didn't want to see the judge.
It was 2017. Wesley had just done 12 years in federal prison on drugs and weapons charges.
The judge who sent him away, U.S. Senior District Judge E. Richard Webber, wanted to talk to him.
For Webber, this is nothing new. The longtime federal judge often visits with the people he has sentenced to prison when they are released.
"I just believe that everybody can have a better life," he told a New York Times reporter a couple of years ago, in explaining his practice.
Wesley said no.
"I didn't really want to go," he says.
But he did, eventually, and it was a good thing. Webber encouraged him to get a job as an over-the-road trucker. The jobs pay well, the judge said.
Wesley was floored. The two men cried together.
And Wesley got to work. He earned a commercial truck driving license. By March 2018, he had a job hauling goods across the country. "It was a blessing," he says.
Then the state of Missouri came calling.
It was Sept. 10, 2018. Wesley was about 120 miles outside of Lansing, Mich., when his boss called.
The family support division of the Missouri Department of Social Services had suspended his driver's license because Wesley was behind on child support.
He couldn't believe it. Wesley knew he was behind on child support for his two kids. They're adults now, but the entire time he was in prison, the state kept adding to the total he was behind. When he got out of prison, Wesley filed a motion to modify his support. The state put a lien on his bank account. Wesley filed for a hearing to review that decision. He says he was told nothing would happen to his driver's license until that hearing took place. It was scheduled for Sept. 24.
Now he had no driver's license. He was fired on the spot, hundreds of miles from home.
"I had to pull over and sit and wait for somebody to come get me," Wesley says. He slept in his truck on the side of the road.
Wesley's dilemma is not uncommon in Missouri, and, in fact, most of the nation.
For too long, driver's license suspension has been used as a debt collection tool for people who can't afford court costs, who fall behind on child support, mostly for an inability to pay, and the practice has perverse results.
That's why St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell announced a plan to stop prosecuting most child support cases in criminal court. And it's why two civil rights organizations -- Equal Justice Under Law and St. Francis Community Services -- filed a federal class action lawsuit in March seeking to end Missouri's practice of driver's license suspension in child support cases.
"These suspensions are meant to coerce payment, but for those who cannot pay, the loss of a driver's license counterproductively decreases the likelihood that a person will be able to pay child support, as it often leads to job loss, reduced employment opportunities, eviction, and greater difficulty carrying out the responsibilities of everyday life," the lawsuit alleges. "License suspension as a debt collection method is unconstitutional and irrational when enforced against people who cannot afford to pay: no amount of coercion can force money out of a person who has none. Missouri's FSD (family support division) traps parents in an inescapable cycle of poverty and criminal culpability by suspending their driver's licenses."
Al Johnson, the director of New Covenant Legal Services, says he believes that Wesley's suspension was purely punitive, with no regard for his ability to pay. Since his children are 19 and 22, none of the money the state collects will actually go to them.
"If you're poor and black, this is the sort of treatment you get from the state," Johnson said. The attorney is representing Wesley in his battle with the state. "I think they took his driver's license because he demanded a hearing. It's over the top. He's trying to get back on his feet and they're trying to ruin him."
Many states are doing on their own what the federal lawsuit might force Missouri to do.
Just last week, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock signed a bill that ends that state's practice of suspending driver's licenses for people who can't afford to pay court costs. Virginia passed a similar law earlier this year. Last year a federal judge suspended the practice in Tennessee.
For Wesley, who is 46 and lives in Bellefontaine Neighbors, losing his livelihood while he was trying to rebuild his life after prison was "deflating. It took all the wind out of my sails," he said.
He worked in a warehouse for awhile, and now has his license back, in a temporary agreement with the state. He's driving a truck again, but worried about what comes next.
"A guy is no good if he can't go to work," Wesley said. "Nobody wins."

Texto completo: We're all writers now. We fling words out into the universe through text, email, Facebook and more. Even people who hate writing have to do it, because you need to text your husband back, write your boss a condolence note and do better on Tinder than "hey."
On average, American adults are texting about 30 times a day, twice what they did back in 2011. Not so long ago, these people would have made a phone call; now no one does that except telemarketers who wake you in the middle of the night. On Facebook, more than half a million comments are posted every minute.
So many words. And too often, they are neither convincing nor entertaining. There are ways, however, to write persuasively in your everyday life. To break through the clutter, to get attention and even to bring people over to your side.
In the course of doing research for a book on how people actually change their minds, and what gets them to say "yes" rather than "no," I was distressed to find that I knew much less about it than I thought I did. I figured that my nearly five years as the New York Times Op-Ed editor gave me a pretty strong vantage point on what worked and what didn't. It did -- but I didn't always know why. What I sensed intuitively about effective writing turned out to rest on some deep psychological truths. Understanding them provides tactics that can be exploited in both personal and written interactions.
Some of these rules can be used both in writing and in real life. Until we've banished written communication entirely, we're going to have to keep doing it -- so you might as well get your text messages returned.
______
Tell the Truth
This is a weird one. Facts don't matter all that much as a tool in persuasion. Research going back decades, confirmed again and again, shows that people have a preference for the information that matches what they already believe, and they avoid facts that might disabuse them of their notions. In general you cannot rely on facts to make your case -- more important by far is emotion. On the other hand, people get angry if you mislead them. If you use an anecdote in your argument, make sure it rings true. If it doesn't, you will instantly lose your reader. Truth telling applies to personal interactions, too.
Texting
No: Subway broke down! See you soon!
Yes: 15 minutes late. So sorry. First drink on me.
Why: Accuracy matters. If you repeatedly lie, even about small things, people will stop trusting you. If you blame the subway or traffic, it means you didn't leave early enough. Offer an accurate time frame and present a peace offering.
______
Be Quick About It
Most daily communications are too long and rambling. Get to the point. People are busy. They don't want you to go on and on.
Dating
No: I'm looking for a man who loves fun and can keep up with me. I ski black diamonds, do triathlons, speak five languages, volunteer for hospice and on weekends make five-course meals. Please be interesting in the morning, engaged to the fullest in your work life, and both fun and relaxing in the evenings, always eager to go to the newest play, the newest restaurant and the nearest gallery opening.
Yes: I like to read novels until 3 in the morning, binge watch TV on weekends and walk aimlessly through the city. I know. Riveting!
Why: Honest, direct and short.
______
Just Ask
People underestimate the value of just asking for what they want. Research shows that even strangers are more willing to help than we expect. Don't apologize, and be direct. If you do ask and you're rejected, you've lost nothing. People are loath to ask for help because they fear rejection, they're anxious and they're embarrassed -- but humans are wired to want to help. It's not hard to understand the psychology -- just look at yourself. When someone asks you to attend a party or give them a ride, you probably make an effort to do it, even if you don't really want to.
Getting someone to show up
No:
Dear Everyone,
I'm involved with a group that gives scholarships to young people and I am hoping that some of you might be able to attend our celebration next Monday. Let me know if you can.
Yes:
Dear Trish,
I'm involved with a group that gives scholarships to young people and I am hoping that you can attend our celebration next Monday. A number of people you know, including John and Jim, will be there. Can I leave your name at the door? It's at 6 p.m. at the Historical Society Building.
Why: It's personal, so you have to answer -- there would be a social cost in skipping a reply.
______
Know Your Audience. That Means Listening.
To reach someone, ask questions and really listen to the answers. We're persuaded by people who make it clear they understand us, that they relate to our concerns. So seek out those opportunities for connection. If you are warm and friendly and seem like you've tried to understand me, I'll be more likely to go along with you. Think about this in everything you write. What does your audience, whether one person or 50, really want to hear?
A condolence letter
No:
Dear So and So,
I was so sorry to hear about your father. It's very hard to go through that. I'm thinking of you.
Yes:
Dear So and So,
I was so sorry to hear about your father. I remember the time he came to my Thanksgiving, and you and I imagined for just a minute what it would be like if he got together with my mother. He was kind and charming, like you, and I am glad I got a chance to meet him.
I am thinking of you.
Why: Always make it personal, to show you know your audience and what will make them feel connected to you and appreciative of the note. Think about what the person would want to hear.
______
Banish Jargon
If you're talking to someone in your field, you can theoretically get away with phrases like "optimize opportunities" and "maximize the cost-effective strategies," but it doesn't make you sound smart. It makes you sound like a robot. Actually, worse. Even Alexa uses conversational language.
Writing to someone who just interviewed you for a job
No: Thank you very much for taking the time to talk today. I am certain that I will be able to contribute a great deal to your organization, especially by optimizing your relationships with the media, employing the multilevel skills I have developed over the years. I look forward to hearing from you.
Yes: Thank you so much for taking the time to talk today. I have some additional thoughts on how you could get more media attention without adding any more staff members. For one, I think you could do more with Instagram stories. I am happy to send more details if you would like that. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Why: All the gratitude, none of the jargon.
No matter the audience, write simply and clearly. That takes longer, but the effort will pay off. You're not looking for a long answer in return -- just an answer, and ideally, a "yes."

Texto completo: ALBANY — New York would become one of the first states to outlaw racial discrimination based on natural hairstyles like braids, twists and dreadlocks under a bill introduced at the state Capitol last week.
The proposal from state Sen. Jamaal Bailey, D-Bronx, and Assemblywoman Tremaine Wright, D-Brooklyn, would make clear employers and schools can't discriminate on the basis of someone's hairstyle if it is "historically associated with race."
Practically speaking, the bill would prevent employers and schools from requiring their black employees or students to straighten their hair, or setting a dress code that prevents braids, dreadlocks or similar hairstyles.
The bill was introduced three months after New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued guidelines preventing discrimination based on hair and a month after the California Senate approved a similar measure.
As it stands, New York state law prevents employer discrimination based on a variety of traits, including age, race, creed, sex and color.
Wright and Bailey's bill, which was introduced Thursday, would expand the legal definition of race to include "ancestry, color, ethnic group identification and ethnic background," including any "traits historically associated with race" such as "hair texture and protective hairstyles."
Examples of "protective hairstyles" are braids, locks and twists, among others, according to the bill.
The same definition also would be added to the state Dignity For All Students act, which deals with bullying in schools.
Bailey and Wright could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.
The proposal is similar to a measure approved unanimously by the California Senate on April 22. That measure is awaiting a vote in the California Assembly.
New York City, meanwhile, took the action unilaterally.
The city Commission on Human Rights changing its guidelines in February to make clear city residents have the right to "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state," according to The New York Times.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose wife, Chirlane, is black, said his relationship with his wife dating back to the early 1990s "began my education on the question of hair."
"You know, she told me many, many stories of people, particularly women, being looked down on because they had natural hair, or because they had dreadlocks, or whatever it may be," de Blasio said in February. "And it's appalling to me that that ever went on, but it still goes on to this day."
De Blasio continued: "It's not acceptable. It must end, and we're going to lead the way here in New York City."
New York is considering a bill that would explicitly ban racial discrimination based on natural hairstyle such as braids, bantu knots and locks.

Texto completo: Teenagers need melodrama. They always have. It seems its big, sweeping emotions are somehow the only things that can match the high-stakes, hormone-enhanced teenage feelings. Director Ry Russo-Young excels at rendering those emotions with a singular sense of artfulness. In "The Sun is Also a Star," Russo-Young swirls together sun-dappled selfies, luscious skin, urban grittiness and hip-hop beats, the aesthetics perfectly matched to emotion. She creates a heady, knee-buckling mood that nearly conceals the weaknesses in story and performances.
The film is the feature adaptation of Nicola Yoon's second novel. Her first, "Everything, Everything," also went on to success as a movie adaptation, starring Amandla Stenberg and Nick Robinson in a swoony take on a Bubble Boy story. The sick teen genre is a well of deep potential with its heightened stakes and ticking clock. And in the structural sense, "The Sun is Also a Star" is also a sick teen movie - without sickness. But the stakes are high and the clock is ticking - on a mandatory deportation from the United States.
Yara Shahidi (of "black-ish" and "grown-ish") stars as Natasha, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants but a New Yorker through and through. The day before her family is set to be deported back to Jamaica, she makes a last-ditch attempt to change their fate by pleading their case to an immigration lawyer. She's spotted in Grand Central Station by Daniel ("Riverdale" star Charles Melton), who notices she's staring at the starry ceiling, and he interprets her "Deus Ex Machina" jacket as a sign. Daniel is a poet, a dreamer and a believer in destiny, and he takes off after her. First he saves her from a speeding BMW in Chinatown, then persuades the science-driven Natasha to spend some time doing the "36 Questions" love study from the New York Times. "Give me a day," he says, "and you'll fall in love with me."
Easy for the easy-on-the-eyes Melton to say! Shahidi and Melton both possess an otherworldly kind of beauty, and combined with Russo-Young's lush, rhythmic cinematic style, you could just watch them bop around the city for hours, all shiny hair and plush lips. But then, they open their mouths and the spell is broken. The dialogue (script by Tracy Oliver) just grinds things to a halt, with speeches that are a bit too on the nose, and too-grand declarations of love. Then again, all those things seem so profound and meaningful at that age.
As pretty as Shahidi and Melton are, they just don't share a palpable chemistry. Shahidi is undoubtedly a star, and while Melton is charming and gorgeous with a goofy puppy-dog energy, the more dramatic moments demonstrate the upper limitations of his range. Shahidi's few short scenes with immigration lawyer John Leguizamo are far more riveting.
That's somewhat covered up by Russo-Young's impressive filmmaking. A New York City native, she captures the arresting energy of the city while imbuing the film with a sense of lyricism and grace, as if the streets are sprinkled with magical fairy dust. The world looks the way it feels when you're falling in love, like everything is at its best, and everything makes sense. When you're looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn't seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse.

Texto completo: It’s taking former President Barack Obama longer to write his next book than he expected because he’s writing it, rather than using a ghostwriter like his wife did, according to a new report.
Sources who have spoken to Obama claim the former president feels a bit competitive with Michelle Obama, given that her latest book is poised to become the best-selling memoir ever. But Obama has said that he is authoring the book on his own, whereas his wife employed a ghostwriter, The Atlantic reports.
Michelle Obama’s memoir Becoming was published in November and has sold more than 10 million copies since it was released. The New York Times best-seller was the fastest selling book last year and sold more hardcover copies of any book in 2018. The book was ranked Amazon’s No. 1 seller before it was released due to presales.
Michelle Obama’s worldwide book tour concluded this month in Nashville after she visited cities including Copenhagen and Paris.
Barack Obama’s book, which is expected to cover both terms as president, was slated to be released in 2019. But his spokesperson Katie Hill told The Atlantic that it’s uncertain when the book will drop.
Penguin Random House is the publisher for both Barack and Michelle Obama’s books.

Americans deserve a boring Infrastructure Week and a humble infrastructure bill

Texto completo: Put your hands together — it is Infrastructure Week!
That’s why President Trump held a Rose Garden press conference-like event with a sign declaring “No Collusion. No Obstruction.” Infrastructure Week is also why Democrats went around shouting “cover-up!” to every camera and every reporter in Washington.
Of course, three weeks ago was also Infrastructure Week. Remember? Back when Attorney General William Barr testified on Capitol Hill while Democrats called for his impeachment?
You may also recall that Infrastructure Week in 2018 when Trump’s infrastructure rally veered to Roseanne Barr riffs. Or the earlier 2018 Infrastructure Week when Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen told the New York Times he paid a porn star $130,000 in hush money after an affair with Trump.
All of these, of course, are the children of the June 5, 2017, Infrastructure Week, which Trump kicked off by firing FBI Director James Comey.
We could stay true to the spirit of Infrastructure Week and editorialize on Trump’s angry rants or the Democrats’ strategy of flooding the zone with investigations. But instead, we will do something different: talk about infrastructure.
Trump has had two different ways of talking about his infrastructure ambitions. Sometimes, he talks about what a great builder he is, how he imagines remaking cities in the ways you’d expect a commercial real estate developer to dream. Other times, he sounds conservative. He speaks of devolving power to states and focusing on maintaining what we have rather than initiating new boondoggles such as high-speed rail.
If the administration and Congress are ever able to do anything on infrastructure, Trump would be well-served to stick to the conservative route.
Neither the Constitution nor the economics of the situation suggest that roads ought to be funded by the federal government. States and localities can and ought to buy the asphalt, decide where to pour it, and figure out how to fund it. A real infrastructure reform would reduce federal spending on roads and rails to bare bones — just enough to fund inherently national projects.
Between dynamic tolling, gas taxes, mileage-based-vehicle taxes, congestion fees, and market-priced parking, states will find that they can shift the cost of the highways to the users of the highways. If roads can’t pay for themselves, that might be a market signal that that a road doesn’t serve an economic use. Sure, a state can maintain or build a road for social, environmental, or other purposes, but roads that are supposedly good for the local economy ought to pay for themselves.
The point is that Uncle Sam should let states figure this out for themselves.
Also, a smart infrastructure bill will resist the California temptation of massive projects with uncertain budgets and endless operating costs.
In other words, the ideal infrastructure bill will not be a big, beautiful, glorious thing. It will be small and humble.
An infrastructure bill doesn't have to be thrilling. Infrastructure Week is exciting enough as it is.

Criminal charge filed against celebrity chef Batali

Texto completo: Mario Batali, the celebrity chef who stepped away from his restaurant empire after several women accused him of sexual harassment and assault, is now facing criminal charges for allegedly kissing and groping a woman against her will in a Back Bay restaurant in 2017.
Batali, 58, is charged with indecent assault and battery in what appears to be the first criminal charge to arise from a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court on Friday morning.
His accuser's name was redacted from court records, but the account matches that of a Massachusetts woman who filed a civil lawsuit against Batali last August.
The Globe does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault without their consent.
The woman told police she saw Batali at Towne Stove and Spirits on Boylston Street on March 31, 2017, according to a criminal complaint filed April 4.
The restaurant is near Eataly Boston, the Prudential Center Italian marketplace that was part of Batali's restaurant portfolio.
She was eating dinner at the bar with a friend and recognized Batali sitting a few seats away, according to the criminal complaint.
The woman told police she was taking a picture of Batali over her shoulder when he noticed her and told her to “come here right now," according to court records. She went over to apologize and tell him she would erase the photo, but Batali told her it was OK and offered to take a selfie with her.
As she stood next to his bar stool, Batali put his arm around the woman and then grabbed her chest, she told police. He then allegedly started kissing her face and touching her groin without her consent, records show.
The woman said she stopped taking photos and pulled away from Batali. She said he kept “pulling on her face" and asked her if she wanted to join him in his hotel room nearby at the Mandarin Oriental, adding that Batali seemed intoxicated “by the smell and half closed eyes," according to the criminal complaint.
She declined and quickly left the restaurant with her friend.
In the civil complaint filed by the Massachusetts woman last summer, her attorneys wrote that her encounter with Batali left her badly shaken.
“Without asking her permission or giving her any warning, and without having received any indication that she had any sexual interest in him whatsoever, which she did not, Batali sexually assaulted her," her lawyers wrote in the civil complaint.
The woman's lawyer declined to comment Wednesday. A lawyer representing Batali said his client denies the accusations.
“The charges, brought by the same individual without any new basis, are without merit," said Anthony Fuller, a partner in the Boston office of the law firm Hogan Lovells. “He intends to fight the allegations vigorously and we expect the outcome to fully vindicate Mr. Batali."
If convicted, Batali could face 2½ years in jail and would have to register as a sex offender.
Like some of the other powerful men who have been accused of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo movement, Batali had faced civil litigation but until now had avoided criminal charges.
In December 2017, three of Batali's former employees and a chef who did not work for him accused him of inappropriately touching them, according to an article on the food publication Eater.
In a statement at the time, Batali said “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt."
“Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses," he said at the time.
Three other women then accused Batali of drugging and assaulting or raping them, according to reports by The New York Times and “60 Minutes."
Police in New York City investigated the accusations, but ultimately decided not to file criminal charges, The New York Times reported in January.
The statute of limitations had run out on two of the cases, and they did not believe they had enough evidence to prove the third, the newspaper reported. The cases could be reopened if more evidence surfaces.
Since the allegations became public, Batali has stepped back from his restaurant and business ventures, which include Eataly Boston and the restaurant Babbo Pizzeria on Fan Pier.

Texto completo: "Protecting the Shield" — an investigative series on police accountability by the Asbury Park Press — won an award from the New York City Deadline Club, one of the most competitive regional journalism competitions in the country.
The winners were announced Monday in a ceremony at the Harvard Club of New York City which featured a talk by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. Other winners included work from The New York Times, The Associated Press, Reuters, CNN and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
The Press' 2018 series won in the category for reporting by newspapers with a circulation under 100,000. The Deadline Club is the New York City chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.
"Protecting the Shield" revealed tens of millions of dollars spent to hush allegations of police abuse, including claims of injury and wrongful death. The series exposed systemic flaws that allowed bad cops to flourish and prompted two statewide policy changes: random drug testing for all police officers and an internal affairs reform that increased oversight of cops.
The series was written by Andrew Ford, Kala Kachmar, Susanne Cervenka, Alex Gecan, Ken Serrano and Paul D'Ambrosio. The project was edited by Executive Editor D'Ambrosio. The online version of the story was designed by Digital Innovator Felecia Wellington Radel with social outreach by Engagement Editor Courtney Marabella. Videos were done by Ford, Kachmar and Thomas P. Costello, with editing by Ryan Ross.
"Protecting the Shield" won several journalism prizes this year, including national awards:
American Bar Association Silver Gavel Award – a national award for outstanding reporting on legal issues.
Livingston Award – Ford was chosen as a finalist for a national award for reporting by journalists under age 35 for selections from the series.
National Headliner award – a video, which you can see at the top of this story, won a third-place prize in this national competition.
New Jersey Press Association's public service prize – the series won the top journalism prize in New Jersey.
USA Today Network competition – The series, main video and web design were named finalists in three categories of the national competition — public service, video and design.

Rochester golf is world-class thanks to some area legends

Texto completo: The return of the Senior PGA Championship to Oak Hill Country Club in Pittsford this week raises a question I've asked before:
Why in the world would the Rochester area, a land where winter comes early and lingers late, be bonkers about golf, a sport best enjoyed in warm and snowless weather?
The answer may best be left to psychologists. However, I'll venture that at least some of the region's infatuation with golf can be attributed to Donald Ross and Walter Hagen, two people who earlier in the 20th century helped establish golf here. Ross built the courses; Hagen showed how they could be played. Rochester got the point.
Born in Scotland in 1872, Ross became a golf caddie at age 10. He later came to the United States and taught golf and eventually began designing courses, more than 400 over his career. The courses vary, but Ross's trademark was wise use of the land's natural contours and hazards and the creation of courses that were demanding but fair.
In Rochester in the early 20th century, there was money and land and interest in golf. Thus, in 1912, Ross was engaged to design a new course for the Country Club of Rochester in Brighton. Not long after that, he designed the first nine holes of Irondequoit Country Club in Pittsford as well as the 18 holes of Monroe Golf Club, also in Pittsford.
In 1923, Ross got his biggest contract here: a deal to design not one but two courses for Oak Hill Country Club. The club was moving to 355 acres of farmland in Pittsford from its original location, along the Genesee River in Rochester, to make way for the new campus of the University of Rochester.
Ross's last course in the area was Brook-Lea Country Club in Gates, finished in 1926, though he would later return to Rochester to make changes to his previous work.
Now, everything old will be new again at Oak Hill, as the club is embarking on a major renovation of the East Course. The work will undo some of the design changes made after Ross, returning parts of the course to the original layout.
Having this many Donald Ross courses in the area, and most of them very close together, is to golf as having several Frank Lloyd Wright houses would be to architecture. Not many people can afford to play on the courses (any more than they could assume the mortgage of a Wright house). But the courses are nice to have in the neighborhood.
If Ross laid the groundwork for golf in Rochester, Walter Hagen made people want to play the sport.
Born in Rochester in 1892, Hagen began his career in golf just as Ross did, by caddying. Some accounts say he was 7 years old, others 10. Whatever, he was a child.
By the time he was 20, Hagen was the head teaching professional at the Country Club of Rochester, where Donald Ross was putting together the course. At age 21, Hagen won the U.S. Open Championship, the first of his 11 major championships and 45 PGA Tour wins.
Hagen exuded style and swagger, bringing new glamor to professional golf. "He elevated the professional golfer from his role as a country club hireling to the status of a friend of royalty and a man of means," wrote the New York Times after Hagen's death in 1969 at the age of 76.
The golfer was living in Michigan at the time of his death, but he had come back to Rochester often and the city was quick to claim him as its own.
The Country Club of Rochester has especially taken him to its heart. On May 23, it will present the first Walter Hagen Ambassador of the Game award to senior golfer Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland.
Clarke will be here for what is officially the KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship, a tournament to be played May 23 through May 26. The event is part of the PGA Tour Champions, which features players 50 years of age and older. It is a separate event from the PGA Championship, the tournament featuring younger golfers that was won by Brooks Koepka on May 19.
Clarke, who is 50, has yet to win a tournament on the senior tour, but he has won 21 tournaments on other tours, including one major championship, the 2011 British Open. The Walter Hagen award recognizes his golfing career as well as his work through the Darren Clarke Foundation to encourage young people to play golf.
Many of the other golfers who will play at Oak Hill this week also have major regular-tour victories on their résumés.
Jeff Sluman, the Rochester native who won the 1988 PGA Championship, will be here. Other luminaries include Bernhard Langer, Tom Lehman, Mark O'Meara, Corey Pavin, Vijay Singh, and Shaun Micheel, the winner of the 2003 PGA at Oak Hill.
All of these golfers have taken on Oak Hill before. Following in the footsteps of Walter Hagen, they'll get another look at a Donald Ross course, one of several that make golf in Rochester more than up to par.

On Remarkable Rochester
Retired Senior Editor Jim Memmott reflects on what makes Rochester distinctively Rochester, its history, its habits, its people. Since 2010, he has also been compiling a list of Remarkable Rochesterians. Contact him at: (585) 278-8012 or JMEMMOTT@DemocratandChronicle.com or Remarkable Rochester, Box 274, Geneseo, NY 14454.
Remarkable Rochesterians Let's add the name of this golfer to the list of Remarkable Rochesterians that can be found at rochester.nydatabases.com:
Danielle Downey (1980-2014): One of the finest Rochester-area golfers ever, she grew up in Spencerport, where she was on the Democrat and Chronicle's All-Greater Rochester team in basketball and a star on the golf team, having learned the game at Brook-Lea Country Club in Gates. She played golf for Auburn University from 1999 to 2003 and was an All-American three times. While in college, she won the New York State Women's Amateur Championship three years in a row. After graduation, she turned pro and played on the developmental tour for the LPGA for several years before qualifying for the LPGA tour. In 2011, she left the tour, and at the time of her death at age 33 in an auto accident, she was director of golf operations at Auburn.

Texto completo: Bryan Carmody, the Bay Area freelance journalist whose house was raided by the police this month, was to get back his property that was seized -- including his laptop and three decades' worth of archives -- following a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday.
Mr. Carmody became a target of the San Francisco Police Department in February, when his reporting was used in three local TV news reports on the death of Jeff Adachi, a longtime public defender. The materials Mr. Carmody sold to the TV stations included a police report that revealed Mr. Adachi had collapsed at an apartment in the presence of a woman who was not his wife.
The police wanted to find out who had given the report to Mr. Carmody. After Mr. Carmody refused to tell them, the police obtained a search warrant, raided his apartment and detained him, in handcuffs, for six hours.
In a Twitter statement on Tuesday, Mr. Carmody said: "I am pleased that everything that the San Francisco Police took from my office and home will be returned today. This includes the police report, video, records, notes, computers and personal electronics."
There are still outstanding motions in the case, including Mr. Carmody's to quash the search warrants used to enter his home -- an early-morning raid in which, Mr. Carmody said, the police wielded a sledgehammer and a battering ram. The police said they were continuing to investigate Mr. Carmody as a possible co-conspirator in what they called the theft of the report.
Mr. Carmody's case has become a cause célèbre for press advocates, who say his journalism is protected by the First Amendment and a California shield law. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and several dozen media organizations, including The New York Times Company, The Associated Press and Dow Jones & Company, have filed an amicus brief in the case.
Some journalists have noted that the Carmody case underscores a relative lack of protection for journalists not backed by large media organizations.
After all, the day after the public defender's death, Evan Sernoffsky, a San Francisco Chronicle crime reporter, published an article citing unnamed sources familiar with the same police report Mr. Carmody gave as supporting material to local TV news programs -- but Mr. Sernoffsky's apartment was not raided.
Audrey Cooper, The Chronicle's editor in chief, suggested that the difference in the status of staff reporters at large news organizations and freelancers might have figured in the treatment of Mr. Carmody.
"It's harder to come after our corporation and come into our newsroom than it is a one-person operation," Ms. Cooper said, adding, "And, of course, no politician in San Francisco wants to pick that fight with us."
Mr. Carmody's brand of journalism differs from the kind practiced by deskbound staff members. He is what some in the business call a stringer or, more colorfully, a "night crawler." That means he jumps on breaking news, frequently in the wee hours. He typically sells his reports to local TV stations and often does not receive on-air credit for his work.
"A lot of it is fires, car crashes, homicides," he said in a recent interview.
In an opinion article last week, Ms. Cooper, the Chronicle editor, defended Mr. Carmody while acknowledging that he was a "less-than-ideal" martyr for the cause of press freedom at a time when it is under broad attack.
His chosen line of work, which he has practiced for nearly 30 years, may make him someone who does not quite fit the public's definition of a journalist -- but his supporters say he deserves the same protections as any reporter with benefits from a known institution.
"Freelancers are legitimate journalists," said Kat Anderson, the interim executive officer at the Pacific Media Workers Guild. "We're entering a danger zone if we start denying someone is a journalist when they claim they are."
In a brief interview Monday, before the hearing, Mr. Carmody was defiant. "I have a full-time job at a media company," he said, referring to his own news agency, North Bay News. "Why they didn't recognize that, I don't know."

Piden “luz verde” para licencias de conducir a indocumentados en Nueva York

Texto completo: Crece la presión para que la legislatura de Nueva York avance el programa que entregaría licencias de conducción a indocumentados en todo el estado.
Una coalición de inmigrantes y activistas se manifestó este martes en Albany, sede del Gobierno del estado de Nueva York, para pedir que se apruebe este vital proyecto de ley.
La propuesta de ley, presentada por el asambleísta Marcos Crespo y el senador Luis Sepúlveda, está a la espera de recibir el respaldo de las dos cámaras legislativas, cuya sesión finaliza a mediados de junio, lo que preocupa a los inmigrantes que dependen de un coche para trabajar o desplazarse.
“Las licencias de conducir son necesarias para familias como la mía. En Long Island y a través del estado hay áreas donde conducir se convierte en la única opción porque no podemos confiar en el sistema público de transporte para ir al trabajo o llevar a nuestros niños a sus citas médicas”, aseguró Silvia García, residente de Long Island y miembro de la organización proinmigrante Se Hace Camino Nueva York.
“Los inmigrantes de Nueva York han esperado por mucho tiempo, necesitamos que la legislatura del estado tome acción ahora”, afirmó García en un comunicado de la “Coalición Luz Verde” que convocó la protesta de hoy.
Doce estados, Puerto Rico y el distrito de Columbia ya han otorgado licencias de conducir a indocumentados.
Para el asambleísta Crespo, el tiempo para restaurar el privilegio de conducir a los residentes que no son ciudadanos “es ahora”, dijo Crespo en referencia a que los indocumentados podían conducir en este estado.
Pero, en el 2002, un año después de los atentados terroristas del 11S, el gobernador George Pataki impuso el requisito de presentar el documento del seguro social para sacar o mantener la licencia de conducir, lo que llevó a que miles perdieran el permiso.
“Esta legislación hará las carreteras más seguras para todos los neoyorquinos. Además aumentará significativamente los ingresos para nuestro estado y reducirá el coste del seguro (de los coches) para todos los conductores” , afirmó.
Aunque resta poco tiempo para que concluya la sesión legislativa, antes de que comience el periodo de vacaciones, aún no hay fecha para votar el proyecto ni el gobernador Andrew Cuomo ha pedido a los legisladores que lo incluyan en la agenda.
Por su parte, el senador Sepúlveda aseguró que el proyecto de ley es “sin lugar a dudas una de las cosas correctas que hay que hacer para Nueva York, con carreteras más seguras, comunidades más fuertes y más unidas y un auge económico”.
Destacó que los inmigrantes indocumentados aportan más de mil millones de dólares al año a la economía del estado y que de aprobarse el proyecto, esa cantidad aumentará con la creación de más empleos, mejores salarios y millones de dólares en ingresos locales y estatales.
En un editorial el pasado abril, el periódico New York Times apoyó la legislación y destacó que se calcula que en Nueva York viven 750,000 indocumentados, lo que suponía más del 5 % de la fuerza trabajadora del estado en 201 6, de acuerdo con el Pew Research Center.

Texto completo: Spoiler alert! The following contains plot details from the “Game of Thrones” series finale, Season 8 Episode 6, "The Iron Throne. "
Sophie Turner has words for fans hating on the final season of "Game of Thrones. "
Speaking with The New York Times the day after Sunday's series finale, the actress who played Sansa Stark, said she wasn't shocked by the hostility, but nonetheless called out petitions against the show.
One Change. org petition, which called on HBO to remake the entire final season with "competent writers," garnered 1. 4 million signatures.
"People always have an idea in their heads of how they want a show to finish, and so when it doesn’t go to their liking, they start to speak up about it and rebel," said Turner, 23.
"The thing about 'Game of Thrones' that’s always been amazing is the fact that there’s always been crazy twists and turns, right from Season 1 with Ned’s beheading," she added. "So Daenerys becoming something of the Mad Queen – it shouldn’t be such a negative thing for fans. It’s a shock for sure, but I think it’s just because it hasn’t gone their way.
"All of these petitions and things like that — I think it’s disrespectful to the crew, and the writers, and the filmmakers who have worked tirelessly over 10 years, and for 11 months shooting the last season," she added. "Like 50-something night shoots. So many people worked so, so hard on it, and for people to just rubbish it because it’s not what they want to see is just disrespectful. "
Despite grumbling fans, the series finale, "The Iron Throne," set an HBO ratings record with a total of 19. 3 million viewers watching via cable or streaming. That broke the mark set by the 2002 series finale of the "The Sopranos," which notched 13. 4 million viewers.
'Game of Thrones' series finale recap: A disaster ending that fans didn't deserve
Kit Harington to fans mad about Daenerys: 'You’re culpable, you cheered her on'
When she spoke with the Times, she hadn't yet watched the finale, as she "truly can’t be alone to watch it. "
However, she said she "loved" how things turned out for Sansa, who won independence for the North and became its queen, calling it "kind of the perfect ending for her. ”
Turner explained, "It’s the only place that she really, truly feels safe. It’s the place that she’s the most capable of ruling. She would be a fair and loving ruler, and it’s what she’s been striving for this whole series: to go back home, to protect her home. And finally, she has that. "
'Game of Thrones': Sadly, the show never fixed its problem with women, even in the series finale
Priyanka Chopra: Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas will have a second wedding ceremony
Despite being satisfied with Sansa's fate, Turner can't help but be emotional about the show's end.
"This whole time I felt like I’ve been prepared for it, and now that it’s come to the day and it’s over, it feels horrible," she said. "And, I’m doing a press day for my new movie (the "X-Men" film "Dark Phoenix") but everyone keeps asking me about how I feel, and I just want to cry. "

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump goes after other nations with harsh tweets or statements blistering with bravado, there is often a sense that he's just showing off his favorite diplomatic dance moves. Trump lambastes China and its leader, then praises them. He threatens that a deal will never be done and huge tariffs will be imposed, then relents and suggests another meeting.
The same is true when Trump hurls bombast at Mexico over immigration and trade, or threatens Canada over timber imports, or belittles NATO allies over defense and trade and environmental issues.
But Iran is different.
To National Security Adviser John Bolton the threat of Iranian nuclear weapons has been constant for decades, and demands war. He
is again claiming that Iran has ratcheted up its threats to American troops and interests, even as well-versed and trusted American and allied leaders say that is not the case. The New York Times has reported the Trump administration is drawing up a battle plan that includes 120,000 troops but the British general who is the deputy commander of the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State says "there has been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq or Syria."
The waters are further muddied by our two closest allies in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia, who constantly pressure Trump to hammer Iran to serve their own interests. The only voices saying Iran is an imminent threat now are ones, like Bolton and Benjamin Netanyahu and the Saudi royal family, who always say that, no matter how often later events prove them incorrect.
Sunday, Trump tweeted, "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!" But Iran threatens the United States constantly and the last tweet by its foreign minister was no different. He wrote "Goaded by #B_Team" as he boasted that Iran defeated Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan.
Trump, a master of such bluster, must see Iran's puffed-up chest for what it is, and see Bolton's unrelenting beating of the drums of war for what it is, too.

Here's a good opportunity to learn: the 26th Spring Planting Moon pow-wow at the Marshfield Fairgrounds on Saturday and Sunday .
Anthony Silva, a member of the board of the Massachusetts Center for Native American Awareness, says the annual event is a chance for some of the more than 37,000 Native Americans in Massachusetts and elsewhere to gather as a community.
“And it's a way for us to educate the public about Native Americans that are here now and also about Native American history and culture, by allowing the public to be directly involved at an event — that is, participate instead of just watching something on TV," he says. “The public will have an opportunity to talk to Native Americans about who we are and about our culture."
The gates to the Fairgrounds, 140 Main St., will be open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. both days. There'll be music, foods, crafts, storytelling, intertribal dances, and other traditions in which people, especially children, are encouraged to join in. (Don't worry, the emcee, Earle “Chiefy Mills" of the Mashpee Wampanoag, will announce when the audience may participate.)
If you miss the Marshfield gathering, there's a bigger one later this year in Haverhill: the 31st annual Intertribal Pow-Wow at Plug Pond the weekend after Labor Day. And this year, Silva says, the center-sponsored summer pow-wow, last held in 2016, will return to Endicott Park in Danvers on June 29 and 30. For more information, visit mcnaa.org.
Other happenings: In Boston Tuesday , nursing home advocates, including residents and their families, nurses, nursing assistants, administrators, and various staff, will rally at the State House to urge lawmakers to increase funding and address what they say is a financial and workforce crisis in the sector. Nearly 70 percent of nursing home residents rely on MassHealth, the state's Medicaid program, to pay for their care, the advocates say, and government underfunding by some $362 million annually has led to at least 29 closures. The Massachusetts Senior Care Association rally begins at 10 a.m. Visit maseniorcare.org.
The Arlington Center for the Arts has an unusual exhibit of quilts by local artist Julie Brown Neu now through June 10 that explores gun violence. “Disarming: Memorial Quilts for Mass Shooting Victims" includes more than a dozen quilts, plus “Bullet Holes," a piece in which 796 holes represent victims of mass shootings from 1990 to 2018, and “In Our Sights," which incorporates pages from The New York Times about the massacre in Las Vegas in 2017. The center, at 20 Academy St., is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m . Visit acarts.org.
The Northborough Free Library's Spring Music Series features The Hollands! -- a multinational family band that plays Americana and folk revival music -- on Saturday at 2 p.m. The library, at 34 Main St., is closed for the Memorial Day weekend, but the concert will take place in the Main Meeting Room.Visit www.thehollands.org.
In Lowell , the Brush Art Gallery and Studios, 256 Market St., is hosting contemporary works by more than 30 members of the National Association of Women Artists' Massachusetts chapter now through June 6 . Titled “Breaking Point," the juried exhibit of various mediums explores the artist's struggle to be true to an inner vision versus the need for attention. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday, noon to 4 p.m. Visit thebrush.org.
And here's a chance to spite the rainy weather of the past few weeks: The Nashua River Watershed Association is holding a “Walk at Bolton Flats Wildlife Management Area" on Tuesday from 6 to 8 p.m. for the public to take in the Pine Hill site. The walk will be guided by Chris Buelow, senior restoration ecologist with MassWildlife's Natural Heritage Endangered Species Program and will start on Pine Hill Road in Bolton. Expect some mud.

Texto completo: Everything is Copy
On Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, holiest time of the Jewish year, in 1942, Henry Krystal's mother was forced onto a train and taken to Treblinka. The 16-year-old boy never saw her again. He was sent to camps whose names I've always known: Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Birkenau.
Henry, the only member of his family to survive the war, made it to the U.S., to medical school, and into practice as a psychoanalyst. Both of Henry's sons became renowned psychiatrists. One is an old friend I hold close.
When asked to comment on a study that showed Holocaust survivors outperforming American-born Jews of similar age, Henry told a New York Times reporter, "If I had been part of (the) study, he'd probably see me as very well adjusted. But I don't see myself that way; I have lots of post-traumatic stress-type problems. Many survivors look better from a sociological point of view than from a psychiatric one."
The Holocaust was something I don't remember not knowing about. The danger of difference is clear to most kids, but I understood that the numbers on great-grandpa Max's arm had dark meaning. I was called kike and Christ-killer. Under cover of night, someone spray-painted a swastika in front of our upstate New York house.
In college, I saw the film "Night and Fog," made in 1956, 10 years after the liberation of the concentration camps. I knew I would never watch it again. Indelible images burned into my brain - mountains of shoes, of teeth, of bodies. Things I knew - people forced into ghettos, marched for miles and interned in work camps, 6 million Jews "exterminated" - were made visceral as a camera panned photo footage.
A couple of weeks ago, in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day, I got a notice for a screening of a film called "Who Will Write Our History." A follow-up email from a friend said it was worth seeing. And, he said, maybe a good idea to bring a non-Jewish friend or two.
The documentary is about Oyneg Shabes, a group formed by Polish historian Emanuel Ringelblum, to compile a real-time record of life in the Warsaw ghetto. The little-known archive, created in secret under the gravest threat, consists of documents and artifacts from 60 writers, historians, rabbis, artists and children. Eye-witness testimony.
Warsaw, in 1939, had the second largest Jewish community in the world, behind only New York City. When the Nazis moved in, they corralled 350,000 Jews, nearly a third of the city's total population, into an area of 1.3 square miles.
The Nazis' assiduous documentary compulsion left us with photographs of Jews being humiliated while grinning soldiers looked on, of people sardined into rooms, of skeletal children. We have films of crowds being rounded up naked, shot, and bulldozed into trenches.
"Who Will Write Our History" gives us access to astute, clear-eyed accounts from ghetto-dwellers, few of whom survived. We hear how, in early days, Nazis stopped women wearing fur coats and made them to scrub the streets. With their underwear. And then forced the women to put their panties back on. About tripping over corpses on the sidewalks. About eating one daily meal of thin soup, and attending concerts and lectures in the evening. About complicit Jewish police officers. It tells a human story, moving beyond words.
The archive, buried underground in metal boxes and milk cans in locations only three people knew, was found after the war beneath the ruins of the bombed-out city. It provides a curated exhibit of life under conditions imagination fails to capture.
In 1942, the Nazis began deporting the Jews from the ghetto to the Treblinka killing center. That history is well known. We have seen what happens when despots rise to power, when leaders exploit fear and incite violence, when politics is nothing more than dangerous propaganda.
And yet, it seems we're in danger of forgetting. Anti-Semitism, and its equally deformed sibling, Islamophobia, are on the rise.
Today, 1 in 10 Americans are not sure they've ever heard of the Holocaust. Sixty-six percent of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is.
If you're not up on the long history of totalitarianism and persecution, perhaps it's time to brush up.
And if you don't know anything about Judaism, here's what I understand. It's a religion at whose center is the idea of loving your neighbor as yourself, even though that can be, at times, unimaginably hard.
Six weeks after this past Yom Kippur a man in Pittsburgh said, "We're here to take care of sick people." He said, "We're not here to judge you."
The man said, "I thought it was important to at least talk to him and meet him. You lead by example."
The man said, "He asked me who I was, I said 'I'm Dr. Cohen, the president of the hospital.' And I turned around and left."
After the gunman at the Tree of Life synagogue had been brought into the emergency room yelling about how he wanted to kill all the Jews, the Jewish doctor said he blamed not the shooter but our country's leaders.
He said, "Words mean things. And the words are leading to people doing things like this."

Texto completo: "Dear Evan Hansen" is sold out through eight shows at Heinz Hall Tuesday through May 26, but a limited number of $25 tickets per performance will be available through the "Dear Evan Hansen" digital ticket lottery.
The lottery will begin accepting entries 48 hours prior to the first performance in Pittsburgh, on Tuesday, at LuckySeat.com/dearevanhansen. Entries will be accepted until 9 a.m. the day before the performance.
Fans who have been selected will be notified daily via email and can then purchase up to two tickets at $25 each.
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's "Dear Evan Hansen" FAQ webpage warns patrons who are seeking tickets through a secondary site, "If you see ticket prices exceeding the $150 level ... they are most likely coming from an unauthorized reseller source and may not be a valid ticket." The top price on StubHub, for example, was $240 for the final performance next Sunday.

Texto completo: Celebrity chef David Burke doesn't have any requisite chef tattoos. Nor does he have a fashion-must beard. He doesn't even have a crisp $150 apron. What the "newly 57"- year-old Fort Lee resident does have is skill, talent and lots of experience. He is putting it to use to build a small empire of restaurants, primarily in New Jersey.
His latest — Ventanas at The Modern — is in his adopted hometown Fort Lee.
The chef who made food Insta-friendly before Instagram existed (seen his bacon hanging on a miniature clothesline?), the chef who won a handful of James Beard awards (including Best Chef New York — twice), the chef who received the coveted Meilleurs Ouvriers de France Diplôme d'Honneur (the only American chef to do so) along with many awards and accolades, does not want to keep crossing the George Washington Bridge to perform his culinary magic.
"At my age, I don't need to fly all over the world," said Burke, the father of three. "I'm a Jersey guy." Burke was born in Brooklyn but raised in Hazlet.
And New Jersey is as good a place as any to open and run innovative, inspired restaurants, he believes.
"There are a lot of good restaurants in New Jersey. New Jersey diners are willing to pay the money almost as much as New York diners. No one is using expense accounts anymore."
Burke has partnered with New Jerseyan Alex Duran to open Ventanas (the two are hoping to work together on another North Jersey restaurant in the coming year). He has taken over the kitchen at the 140-year-old Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, (it has been renamed David Burke at Orange Lawn). And he launched Drifthouse by David Burke in Sea Bright, where his younger brother Robert is the chef.
Burke still heads two restaurants in NYC, two in Saratoga Springs, NY, two in Garden City, NY, and one in DC, the steakhouse BLT Prime. This one caused a minor brouhaha when it opened in the Trump hotel in DC after celebrity chefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of the space due to Trump's controversial remarks about Mexicans.
"It's business," Burke said. "I'm not going to discuss what I think of Trump."
He'd much rather talk about food and the restaurant business, a business he's been in for more than 30 years, managing to dazzle critics, diners and bosses alike.
Michael "Buzzy" O'Keefe, owner of The River Cafe, is among them. At The River Cafe — The New York Times titled an article about the cafe "The Restaurant That Launched a Thousand Chefs" — Burke succeeded American culinary titans Larry Forgione and Charlie Palmer.
"[Burke] was the most creative chef of them all," O'Keefe said. "And the other chefs know it, too. He's a big talent — and a nice guy beside."
Burke's ideas are fun, whimsical and ingenious. Among them: swordfish chop, a swordfish steak with its collar bone sticking out ("I was cutting a small fish and saw the collar bone and thought, 'Little fish, little collar bone, big fish, big collar bone'"); lobster steak ("Men in Armani suits don't want to wear bibs to eat lobster, so I took all the lobster meat out and shaped it into a steak"); and lobster dumpling "(I used a small piece of the lobster claw as a handle for the dumpling").
And of course, his clothesline bacon, thick-cut candied bacon hang from a miniature clothesline secured by wooden clothespin. "Bacon is fatty, you want the fat to drip," he said, adding: "It horrified vegetarians."
He's been in the restaurant business since age 15, when he landed a job as a dishwasher at the Sheraton Hotel in Hazlet — "My nickname was 'chef de la plunge,' slang for dishwasher" — and worked his way up.
When he told his dad, a retired subway engineer, he wanted to be a chef, dad wasn't pleased. "I know you smoke pot," Burke recalled his dad saying, "I didn't know you smoked that much."
His dad, today 84 and with whom he's close, signed him up for cooking classes at the local Williams Sonoma because, Burke said, "he thought I'd hate it."
He thought wrong. "It was great," Burke said. The instructors included legends-in-the-making Paula Wolfert and Marcella Hazan.
In 1979, then 17, he worked as a cook in the kitchen of the Navesink Country Club and went to school only in the mornings. His dad, furious, made him pay rent.He graduated high school in 1980 and two years later, graduated No. 2 in his class from the prestigious Culinary Institute of Art.
He went on to work as a private chef in Norway, traveled through Europe, then returned to the U.S. to work for legendary chef Waldy Malouf at renowned French restaurant La Crémaillière in Banksville, NY. Burke was 20.
After two years, he joined heralded French chef Daniel Boulud at Daniel in Manhattan and eventually Charlie Palmer hired him as his No. 2 at The River Cafe, known not only for great food but for its glorious Hudson River views. Two years later Palmer left to open Aureole and Burke became executive chef.
He was a sensation. "Every day was something else," O'Keefe said. One day it was a chocolate cake in the shape of the Brooklyn Bridge, still the restaurant's No. 1 bestselling dessert. (At Ventanas, he offers one in the shape of the GWB.)
"I wanted the food to take diners' eyes away from their lover's eyes and the river," he said.
In the years that followed, he opened ark Avenue Cafe, davidburke & donatella, Fishtail by David Burke, The Fromagerie in Rumson, David Burke's Primehouse in Chicago, Prime in Las Vegas. Those restaurants are closed now. Today, as he put it, "I'm a brand."
The brand however is still in the kitchen. "I'm not just a coach. I'm a cook too."
David Burke, culinary managing director at Ventanas at the Modern, says there are good restaurants in New Jersey.

I.M. Pei, world-famous architect, dies at 102

Texto completo: I.M. Pei, the architect revered around the world for iconic modernist structures including a section of the Des Moines Art Center, has died. He was 102.
Pei, born in China and educated at Harvard, was the creator behind structures like the glass pyramid at The Louvre in Paris, the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, among many well-known buildings in various corners of the world.
He died early Thursday, his son, architect Li Chung Pei, confirmed to the New York Times.
A spacious section of the Des Moines Art Center, made mostly of concrete, was designed by Pei in 1965 and opened in 1968. The addition expanded the Art Center, which was originally designed by Eliel Saarinen in 1948. A third wing of the building, designed by Richard Meier, was added in 1984.
The design of the I.M. Pei wing of the Des Moines Art Center compliments the original Saarinen design while maintaining the architect's trademark austere modernism and penchant for spaces made serene through the use of open space and glass.
The wing often houses the Art Center's sculptures and larger wall-mounted pieces due to its cavernous qualities.
In 2018, the I.M. Pei wing saw the installation of the "River," a curvilinear sculpture of the Mississippi River outline created by Dubuque native Jen Berven. The sculpture is embedded within the concrete walls and took 12 years to complete.
The eponymous wing of the Art Center was not Pei's only gift to the city of Des Moines.
According to former Register staff writer Eliot Nusbaum, Pei visited the city several times in the 1960s, during the wing's construction.
On a walk with David Kruidenier, then publisher of The Des Moines Register and Tribune, Pei asked, "Where's the center of town? I've been looking around, and I can't see it."
After Kruidenier said they didn't have one, Pei responded: "All great cities have an open space at their center."
The idea stuck with the publisher, who later helped lead fundraising that resulted in the building of the Des Moines Civic Center and the adjoining Nollen Plaza, now named Cowles Commons.

Texto completo: Headnote AN OUTPOST OF CHRISTENDOM
ROT FRONT, Kyrgyzstan - Each Sunday, a rickety white bus wheezes down the main street of one of Christendom's most remote and odd outposts in the Muslim world.
The bus travels only a few hundred yards but continues a long, meandering journey begun nearly 500 years ago by German-speaking Mennonite Christians fleeing persecution in Europe. Having survived the fury of the Roman Catholic Church, the Russian empire and then the Soviet Union, their community today in Central Asia is small and shrinking but, against the odds, is still hanging on.
Their principal stronghold here is the village of Rot Front, or Red Front, the Soviet-era name of a tidy, two-street settlement at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains in Kyrgyzstan, a Muslim-majority nation of breathtaking natural beauty and deep poverty formed when the Soviet Union imploded in 1991.
Rot Front, formerly known as Bergtal, or Mountain Valley, is the easternmost outpost of the Mennonite exodus from Europe, which also scattered believers westward to North and South America.
The German community in Rot Front lived for generations in a closed world - entirely German-speaking, dominated by religion, fighting off modern intrusions like television. It is still wary of outsiders but, as residents began emigrating to Germany in the 1990s, and those left behind began using cellphones, interaction with the wider world has grown.
Out of a village with more than 1,000 people, only 10 German families are left. The German bakery closed years ago and the local primary school dropped mandatory lessons in German. The teaching is now all done in Kyrgyz and Russian.
But the Sunday morning bus helps keep alive the religious faith at the heart of the German residents.
Driven by Nikolai Pauls, an ethnic German car mechanic whose 11 siblings have now nearly all left for Germany, the bus collects worshipers - a mix of German Mennonites and Kyrgyz converts - from outside their homes and deposits them at the village's biggest building, a prayer hall decorated with biblical verses in archaic versions of both German and Russian, written in Gothic script.
Irina Pauls, the bus driver's wife and a singer in the church choir, said she and her husband had planned to move years ago for Germany but stayed put because their five children did not want to leave their friends.
Whether to leave, she said, "is a very painful question."
She has often visited relatives in Germany, where nine of her 11 siblings now live, and admires German order and neatness. "Here Kyrgyz people think we are crazy because we cut the grass," she said.
Three of her grown children have moved to Germany, and she worries about the marriage prospects of the two daughters still in Rot Front. Mennonites rarely marry outside their faith, and while German believers sometimes marry Kyrgyz converts, Pauls said she would like her children to marry fellow ethnic Germans.
"There is still a line between us," Pauls, 56, said. "The Germans are on this side, the Kyrgyz on the other."
But finding a suitable spouse for her remaining children, she said, is growing increasingly difficult as emigration drains the pool of eligible grooms and brides who share her family's faith and speak Plautdietsch, a dialect of Low German.
The Mennonites and Amish both belong to the Anabaptist tradition, a reformation movement dating to the 1500s that rejected aspects of the established Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. They share a commitment to pacifism and simple living.
The German Mennonites who settled in Kyrgyzstan started their journey east in the early 16th century from what is now the northern Netherlands.
After settling first in West Prussia, now part of Poland, they moved on to Russian-controlled Ukraine in the 18th century, and then to Kyrgyzstan, settling first in the west and then on rich farmland in the Chuy Valley east of the capital, Bishkek.
The original German names given their new settlements have mostly been lost. The German names that survive were imposed on towns by Moscow and given a Soviet slant, like Rot Front.
Of the approximately 100,000 ethnic Germans who lived in Kyrgyzstan when the Soviet empire collapsed in 1991, only 8,300 remain.
In Rot Front, the exodus to Germany has been accompanied by a wave of new arrivals, mostly Kyrgyz but also a few Westerners.
A Canadian Christian purchased three houses built by Germans, setting up shelter for Kyrgyz orphans, a guesthouse and a farm.
Wilhelm Lategahn, a non-Mennonite schoolteacher, came to Rot Front from Germany on a government program to promote the German language. He intended to stay a year or so but, nearly a decade later, is still here. He set up a small museum to honor the village's fading German heritage.
At the prayer hall, built in 1987 after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev relaxed restrictions on religion, female worshipers sit on one side while their husbands, fathers and sons sit on the other.
Germans and Kyrgyz mix constantly - in prayer, at school and at work in the fields, where residents grow their food and raise cattle. They communicate mostly in Russian, the one language everyone speaks fluently.
The village also has a mosque, but it is much smaller than the Mennonite prayer hall.
After attending prayers on a recent Sunday, German and Kyrgyz children gamboled together along the main street, chattering away in Russian. Lotti Schmidt, 12, said she missed friends who had moved to Germany but still wanted her own family to stay in Rot Front.
Even many of those who have left still come back regularly on visits.
Adolf Kopp, who moved to Germany in 2011, still keeps the house he and his wife built in 1958 in Rot Front and recently returned with a son and son-in-law to do some repairs.
"I get so bored in Germany," he said. "I miss all my friends here."
His memories of Rot Front, however, are not all rosy. His father, the head of the village's early Soviet-era collective farm, was executed at the height of Stalin's Great Terror in 1938.
Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 turned ethnic Germans across the country into enemies of the people. Much of Rot Front's adult population was sent to labor camps, leaving German children to fend for themselves, often with help from local Kyrgyz, who sheltered and fed them in the mountains.
The wartime experience broke down many of the cultural and language barriers that had previously separated ethnic Germans and the indigenous Kyrgyz population. It also made it difficult for Germans who survived the war in Rot Front to feel comfortable in Germany.
Their offspring, too, can find life in Germany problematic.
Andrej Keller, a 59-year-old ethnic German who was born and raised in Rot Front, said he had tried moving to Germany in 2011, but, unable to find a job, returned to his Kyrgyz village after just 18 months away.
He said he, like many others, had been seduced by the promise of an easy life in Europe.
"Everyone wants to drive a big car, a Mercedes, and eat fat sausages." he said. "But I was not used to big sausages. Life there was comfortable but I could not get used to it.
"The human needs very little to be satisfied," he added. "As my mother used to say: 'To be satisfied you need very little and who is satisfied is a king.' People never have enough of everything. You have to be happy where you live. If there is no war there, what more do you want?"
"Germany is not our country," he said. "Our country is here where we were born, this is my home. Here I grew old."

Texto completo: Recently, the New York Times published an opinion piece about religious liberty and it made a stir. Headlined “We are taking religious freedom too far,” the piece made waves not because of the subject matter, but because of how straightforward author Margaret Renkl was about stripping Americans of one of their most fundamental rights.
In the piece, Renkl rattles off a number of examples that show people are being discriminatory, even engaging in behaviors that hurt or kill other people, on account of them exercising their God-given, constitutionally protected, religious freedom. She writes of a bakery owner in Tennessee who, much like Jack Phillips, was unable to provide a wedding cake to a couple once he learned the pair getting married were lesbians. He claimed doing so would have violated his beliefs. Renkl claims “Conservative Christians are forever trying to inject their personal religious beliefs into the public sphere.” She rants:
It would be almost funny if it weren’t so unfair. It’s illegal for a store owner to discriminate against customers because they happen to belong to a group against which the shopkeeper harbors a personal prejudice. It’s illegal for a racist to open a restaurant that serves only white people. Prejudice cloaked in the robes of religious faith should follow the same precedent.
This is a grave misunderstanding of the legal and historical context of religious freedom. Puritans traveled to America to freely practice religion without the grip of a tyrannical king telling them who they could worship and how. America is rooted in Judeo-Christian beliefs. This faith is structured around a set of principles, not prejudice, just like all religions are. Religion is the exercise of a specific set of ideas, based on faith, that guides how a person lives and behaves. It’s been this way for centuries. Christianity has been labeled a lot of things, but it wasn’t called “prejudice” or “discriminatory” until progressives started to conflate equality with entitlement and pushed for their rights to supersede the rights of a religious person.
Renkl’s primary beef is with people who refuse to vaccinate their children because of their religious beliefs. While it’s true many "anti-vaxxers" are religious, this is an entirely different scenario from her previous example about baking a wedding cake for a lesbian wedding ceremony. The Supreme Court has already said that the federal government may limit religious freedom when it needs to protect others and has a compelling interest to do so. Jim Crow laws were deemed unconstitutional and the government interfered because they reinforced discrimination of the entire African-American community.
While many states have not yet stepped in to revoke the religious exemption, I wouldn’t be surprised if a few of them did and maintained their legal authority to do this. Requiring "anti-vaxxers" to abide by certain guidelines, so they don’t infect others, would be a “compelling interest” of the government.
Lathan Watts, director of legal communications for the First Liberty Institute, told me:
Renkl seems to think that the 'free exercise' clause of the First Amendment exists exclusively in the minds of the faithful. The word 'exercise' always implies and requires action—but in this instance, so crucial to the American way of life, she suggests it only means belief. If all that was required of me to have six-pack abs was to believe in my mind and heart that I do, I would look more like the original Thor instead of Thor Lebowski from Endgame. This line of thinking would be funny if it weren’t so dangerous.
Renkl is right to be frustrated, outraged even, over the growing number of people putting children at risk because they’re refusing to vaccinate their children due to their religious beliefs. However, this is not the same issue as people who don’t serve wedding cakes to gay couples due to their religious beliefs, nor should they be conflated as such.
Religious people in America don’t have a “pass” like she suggests in her conclusion, to treat people however they want under the guise of faith. If anything, cases like Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission show the government and progressives alike enjoy taunting people of devout faith with claims of equality when really they’re looking for entitlement.
Religious liberty hasn’t gone too far. If anything, everybody else has gone too far the other direction, trying to push faith out of public life as much as possible.

Our View: If Spanish makes you nervous, why not learn some?

Texto completo: In New Mexico, picking up the sounds of a language other than English is part of daily living. That's true whether it is Spanish overheard while shopping, two Tewa speakers chatting while picking up burritos or French spoken by visitors walking along the Plaza -- we are a multicultural, diverse state and proud of that distinction.
Contrast that reaction to this news from the Pew Research Center, which found that when it comes to languages other than English, there is a distinct partisan divide. Hearing languages that are not English make white Republicans nervous, apparently.
The Pew survey found that 47 percent of white Republicans admit that hearing people speak a language other than English in a public place would bother them "some" or "a lot." That's compared to 18 percent of white Democrats who also say they would be bothered.
According to the survey, among all racial groups, whites (34 percent) are the most likely to be bothered hearing foreign languages, followed by blacks (25 percent), Asians (24 percent) and Hispanics (13 percent). Among Americans overall, 70 percent put their level of unease at "not much" or "not at all." While 70 percent is a wide majority, that number could -- and should -- be even higher.
Not only is the U.S. a nation of immigrants, where people speak many languages -- and learn English along the way -- we live in a competitive global economy where having multilingual capabilities makes it easier to find and keep jobs.
This discomfort with the "other" matters as more than an oddity, too. People in our country are being accosted for speaking Spanish. In Montana last year, a U.S. Border Patrol agent detained two U.S. citizens just because he overheard the women speaking Spanish at a gas station. A New York man ranted at Spanish-speaking employees of his local deli, and even threatened to call immigration on them.
Rather than be uncomfortable, we like what the Florida Marlins baseball team is doing -- teaching Spanish to members of the organization.
In baseball, many players are foreign-born, often from Spanish-speaking countries. Nearly 30 percent of major league players fall in that category. Until they learn English, they can't communicate with their team members, fans, coaches or the media. And their English-only teammates can't speak to them.
To fix that, the Marlins team is sending everyone from players to coaches to administrators to Spanish classes -- it's the brainchild of former Yankees superstar Derek Jeter, chief executive of the Marlins. He told the New York Times that he had watched Spanish-speaking players pick up English, but decided that more needed to be done.
"Communication is a big part of this game, whether it's pitcher-catcher communications or just teammates communicating," he told the Times. "So it's just as important for the English-speaking players to learn Spanish."
Eventually, he wants everyone in the organization to be comfortable speaking at least some Spanish. That will endear the team to its fans -- Miami is the city with the highest-percentage of Spanish speakers of any major metropolitan area in the United States. It also will create friendships, bridge cultural divides and create a team of equals. Best of all, no one needs to feel threatened or ashamed because of what language they speak.

Helaine Olen: Alabama’s abortion ban doesn’t promote life. It exhibits contempt for it.

Texto completo: On Tuesday, the Alabama state legislature decisively passed a bill that would criminalize all abortions in the state. It was accompanied with the usual tripe about the sanctity of life. “When God creates the miracle of life inside a woman’s womb,” one Alabama state legislator piously opined, “it is not our place as human beings to extinguish that life.”
Less than 24 hours later, we got a chance to see just how well the United States actually does at encouraging women to give birth to children: not well at all.
According to data released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fertility among women in the United States hit a record low. Don’t get me wrong — many of the reasons for the falloff can be considered good. The drop is most dramatic among teens and women in their early 20s, something many observers say is a result of better access to and use of birth control. The increasing number of women attending college also likely plays a role.
But it’s also true that surveys show many women would like to have more children than they ultimately do, and that U.S. society’s family-unfriendly aspects likely share much of the blame for why they don’t. When The New York Times surveyed the issue last year, they discovered the high cost of child care was cited by almost two-thirds of their respondents when asked to explain why they didn’t have children or had fewer then they considered ideal. Half claimed economic fears stopped them, slightly more than 4 in 10 said they “can’t afford more children” and about a third cited such things as lack of paid family leave, climate change and domestic politics. (People were allowed to choose more than one answer.)
Alabama is not alone. Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky and Mississippi have passed laws this year banning abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be heard, something that effectively bans the procedure. None of these states mandate paid family leave. Georgia has the second-highest maternal mortality rate in the United States. In fact, a woman is more likely to die while giving birth or shortly thereafter in our country than in other First World nations.
Instead of addressing this like the medical emergency it is, the Trump administration is attempting to overturn the Affordable Care Act. The ACA bans insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions, something, that among other things, was used to deny payment for pregnancy care and childbirth back before the law took effect. So trying to get rid of the law doesn’t exactly scream care and concern for the health and welfare of mothers and children.
Children are also less than well tended to after birth here in the United States. Many child-care workers are paid so little, they are dependent on government benefits to get by, while decent child care itself is so difficult to come by that it costs more than to send a child to public college in more than half the states. We whine on about improving our public education system, but don’t actually want to spend money to do that: Teachers, who are 75 percent female, are paid about 20 percent less than other similarly credentialed professionals.
And when it comes to the future of those children — well, we fall apart here too. Climate change and a biodiversity implosion are literally destroying the future of our children and grandchildren, but the Trump administration is moving backward and denying the threat, making a dire future all the more likely. To go on and on about abortion, while doing nothing at all about the existential threat facing all of us, reveals a level of hypocrisy that’s all but breathtaking.
That the lecherous Donald Trump is presiding over this sustained rollback of women’s reproductive rights and seeming social breakdown is a feature, not a bug. We know that banning abortion doesn’t stop it. Instead, it drives women to desperate measures, including dangerous, back-alley procedures. It stands to reason that women will die if the Supreme Court ultimately upholds these laws. Denying a woman a right to a legal abortion is not an expression of love for women and children. It is instead an expression of hatred and contempt.

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has used Westchester as a backdrop for several invitation-only rallies over the past two years, which highlighted his taxpayer- friendly policies, the confounding multiplicity of suburban government entities and the scourge of high property taxes.
Tax Watch columnist explores Gov. Andrew Cuomo's extended review of Westchester's sales-tax increase as he prepares to move from the county.
As Gov. Andrew Cuomo prepares to move from the New Castle home he shares with his partner, Sandra Lee, Westchester County waits patiently for the governor to sign a bill passed six weeks ago to raise the sales tax – and bring sorely needed property-tax relief to the county.
Cuomo has not moved with alacrity, despite the pleas for action by Democratic political leaders who thought, perhaps, that the governor would deliver for the county where he has lived for the past 20 years.
So far, no such luck.
"We're chilling," said County Executive George Latimer. Latimer was unwilling to criticize Cuomo, who has yet to say whether he will sign the bill.
Cuomo has used Westchester as a backdrop for several invitation-only rallies over the past two years, which highlighted his taxpayer-friendly policies, the confounding multiplicity of suburban government entities and the scourge of high property taxes.
Property taxes aren't cheap at Lee's three-acre spread with a pond on Bittersweet Lane, where Cuomo says he splits living expenses with his partner. Property taxes were $37,912 in 2018.
Latimer wanted the sales-tax hike included in the 2019-2020 state budget, which, if passed as expected in late March, would have given Westchester seven months of collection in 2019, providing the county with an estimated $49 million in new revenues. An estimated $7 million of that total would have been shared with Westchester school districts, which were hoping to count on the extra dollars for budgets up for votes next Tuesday, May 21.
The sales-tax revenue would have also allowed Latimer to deliver on his promise to balance the county budget — instead, the county may have to sell 14 acres of parkland in White Plains for $23 million — while also providing funds to bolster the county's dwindling reserves. The sales-tax revenue would have also provided enough funding to cap county property taxes in Westchester for two years.
No way, said Cuomo.
We don't do sales-tax increases as part of the state budget, the governor said. Give me a stand-alone bill, he said.
Undaunted, Westchester legislators sprang into action. By April 9, the stand-alone sales-tax bill passed both houses, with only Assemblyman Kevin Byrne, R-Mahopac, and state Sen. Peter Harckham, D-Lewisboro, opposing it among Westchester's 13-member Albany delegation. They hoped that was enough time to get bill signed by the end of April, so Westchester could have the tax on the books by June 1.
With the bill first passed by the state Senate, it was up to the staff of Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, to negotiate with the governor as to when the bill got sent to him for action.
Not now, Cuomo said.
He wasn't ready to sign the bill that his home county said it needed. A Cuomo spokesman told Tax Watch that the staff was still reviewing the matter.
Now it seems likely that the bill will be bundled with other local sales-tax bills, which traditionally get passed in the Legislature's final push at the end of the annual session in late June. Westchester holds out hope that Cuomo, who considers himself the taxpayer's friend, will sign the bill by the end of July, so the county sales-tax hike could go on the books for Sept. 1.
But who knows whether Cuomo sign it, or position himself with Bryne, the Mahopac Republican whose district includes northern Westchester, and Harckham, the former Cuomo administration housing official, who this week sent out a mailing on taxpayer expense, touting his votes against Albany-imposed tax increases.
Cuomo's extended review of the Westchester sales tax bill comes as the governor packs up his belongings from Bittersweet Lane, right off Route 133, near the border with Mount Kisco.
It's the house where a 2014 Tax Watch investigation discovered that Lee had conducted extensive renovations on the home, without obtaining building permits from the town.
Without building permits, the town assessor did not have the opportunity to raise the assessment to reflect the improvements. After the story was published, and after Cuomo and Lee refused to allow the assessor to inspect their home, he raised the assessment by 29 percent.
It had a big impact on the property taxes paid by Cuomo and Lee. Property taxes leapt from $28,606 to $36,977 in 2015, and had inched up to $37,912 in 2018, town records show.
Lee is putting the house on the market Friday for $2.3 million, The New York Times reported. The New Castle assessor puts its taxable value at $1.3 million.

Texto completo: For more than a year, Apple Inc. avoided major damage from the U.S. trade war with China, thanks in part to a White House charm offensive by Chief Executive Tim Cook. But the company now faces its first major hit -- from both sides of the dispute.
A new round of tariffs proposed by the U.S. on Monday -- which would go into effect in late June, at the earliest -- includes mobile phones. That means the iPhone, Apple's most important product, may be encumbered with a 25% import levy because it is made almost entirely in China. There are other products on the list that would affect Apple too, such as laptops and tablets.
That leaves the company with a difficult choice: raise prices on already-pricey products and risk missing out on sales, or absorb the extra cost and let profits suffer.

There's a "very real risk of higher import costs and/or U.S. consumer demand destruction depending on whether Apple decides to pass along some of the tariff cost," Krish Sankar, an analyst at Cowen Inc., wrote Tuesday in a note to investors. "Given that the majority of Apple's hardware products that include the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Mac systems are assembled and imported from China, the earnings risk could be quite substantial."
China retaliated Monday with plans to increase tariffs on U.S. imports to 25% from 10%. That would apply to components for the iPad and iPhone. So when U.S.-made parts, including glass screen covers and facial-recognition sensors, are shipped to China for assembly into iPhones and iPads, they will be more expensive too.
The main concern is the iPhone, though. It accounted for 63% of sales in 2018, and serves as a hub for additional revenue from services and related devices such as the Apple Watch. The newest iPhones cost $750 to $1,450, so any price increases could take the devices beyond the budgets of more consumers.
The heightened trade tensions are a test for Cook and the global supply chain he helped build and run. Last year, the CEO showed political prowess by meeting with President Trump to argue against tariffs.
Just over a year ago, Cook met Trump in the Oval Office. The CEO said he opposed the president's approach and focused on how cooperation between countries can boost the economy more than nations acting alone. After the meeting, the administration told Cook it would not place tariffs on iPhones, the New York Times reported.
Apple also wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in September asking him to reconsider tariffs and instead take other measures that would support the U.S. economy and American consumers. Later that month, the White House spared Apple's Watch and AirPods.
By late 2018, Apple's strategy had become less effective. In late November, Trump told the Wall Street Journal he might impose tariffs on mobile phones and laptops, and said consumers "could stand" a 10% increase in prices "very easily." The day after, Cook toured schools in Idaho with Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior advisor.
As 2019 began, the real cost of the trade war for Apple began to emerge. The company cut revenue projections, and Cook said the Trump administration's trade policies had indirectly hurt consumer demand for iPhones in China.
More recently, the company has raised prices when it refreshed products that have already been hit with tariffs. The updated Apple Pencil, launched in October, costs $30 more than the previous version. The faster Mac mini costs $300 more than its predecessor.
That suggests the company may take a similar approach with the iPhone. In its September letter to Lighthizer, Apple said tariffs would increase product prices.
The 25% tariff on iPhones would probably apply to the wholesale price of the devices when they are imported from China. Apple doesn't disclose wholesale prices, but research firms often estimate the bill of materials.
A $1,249 iPhone XS Max with 256 gigabytes of storage has $453 worth of parts, according to TechInsights. A 25% levy on that would be $113, raising the purchase price by about 9%. Apple's other models, the iPhone XS and the iPhone XR, could face a similar increase, according to estimates. In a recent note to investors, Morgan Stanley estimated that a $999 iPhone XS would cost $160 more. JPMorgan analysts forecast a 14% price increase.
This may apply only to U.S. iPhone sales, limiting the damage. About a third of iPhone revenue comes from the U.S., according to Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
That won't address the problem of even more expensive iPhones, though. A series of price increases in recent years has already coincided with declining sales. If Apple passes the whole tariff cost to U.S. consumers, demand could drop by 10% to 40%, Cowen's Sankar estimated Tuesday. That, in turn, may slice earnings per share by 1% to 4% in fiscal 2020, the analyst said.
Alternatively, Apple could eat the cost. That would dent earnings per share by 6% to 7%, based on a $450-per-device import cost and annual U.S. sales of 40 million units, Sankar said.
Still, Apple has experience absorbing extra costs. When currencies swing, the company manages to protect its gross profit margins, Cross said.
Apple could work around the tariff issue as well. There's a possibility of Apple rejiggering its supply chain to build more products outside China. Apple is ramping up production in India to avoid local taxes and has done similar work with Foxconn in Brazil.

John Paul Stevens: Heller gun control decision the worst in 35-year Supreme Court tenure

Texto completo: Retired Justice John Paul Stevens is lambasting the Supreme Court's 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller decision broadening gun rights, calling it the “most clearly incorrect” ruling of his 35-year career on the high court.
“Heller is unquestionably the most clearly incorrect decision that the court announced during my tenure on the bench,” Stevens, 99, wrote in his new memoir, The Making of a Justice.
The retired justice penned the main dissent in the Heller case, which established the right to keep guns for self-defense in the home. Joining Stevens’ dissent were Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.
The court divided along ideological lines in the case, with Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, siding with the conservative wing of the bench in striking down the District of Columbia’s ban on handguns.
“Their twin failure in that case — first, the misreading of the intended meaning of the Second Amendment, and second, the failure to respect settled precedent — represent the worst self-inflicted wound in the court’s history,” Stevens wrote of the majority. “They also represent the most disappointing task on which I worked as a member of the court.”
In addition to voicing his discontent with the Heller decision, Stevens also revealed in his book the internal deliberations that took place following the March 2008 oral arguments in the case.
Stevens said he believed Kennedy or Justice Clarence Thomas could have been persuaded to change their votes, and he had discussions with both in hopes of convincing them to do so.
Stevens also took the unusual step of circulating his draft dissent five weeks before the late Justice Antonin Scalia circulated the majority opinion.
In a memo accompanying his draft dissent, Stevens said he decided to share it with his fellow justices “because I fear the members of the majority have not yet adequately considered the unusual importance of their decision.”
“Because there is still time to avoid a serious and totally unnecessary self-inflicted wound, I urge each of the members of the majority to give careful consideration to the impact of this decision on the future of this institution when weighing the strength of the arguments I have set forth in what I hope will not be a dissent,” Stevens wrote in his memo to his colleagues.
Stevens was ultimately not able to persuade Thomas and Kennedy to change their votes, and he lamented that he “failed to emphasize sufficiently the human aspects of the issue” to Kennedy.
Still, the retired justice wrote that his early discussions with Kennedy, who retired last year, “may have contributed to his insisting on some important changes before signing on to the court’s opinion.”
Stevens retired from the Supreme Court in 2010, and since then, he has not hidden his distaste for the Heller decision.
In March 2018, he called for a repeal of the Second Amendment in an op-ed for the New York Times and has also advocated for a constitutional amendment to overrule the 2008 decision.
Stevens has also lamented that lawmakers have failed to implement more stringent gun control measures.

Pete Buttigieg was Facebook’s 287th user. Now he says the company has too much power.

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network’s founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
“I don’t think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,” Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley’s other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook’s future took on new resonance last week as one of the company’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, “made a very convincing case” that no company “should have the type of power that… these tech companies have.”
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn’t endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting “a spectrum” of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That’s attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg’s vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
“Here in the Bay Area, we’ve been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete’s going to do it,” said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. “Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.”
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg’s account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests) — if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad’s original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like “a curiosity,” and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he’s used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor’s office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 — attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions — he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg’s car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he’s also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.
“What they’ve done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,” marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who’s been to the city multiple times at the mayor’s invitation. “You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you’re in San Francisco.”
Rogers, who’s hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be “literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable” about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called “political theater where very little actually got achieved.”
“What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing — which is incredibly dangerous,” Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders “need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.”
“This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips,” he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that “a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they’ve increasingly turned into Goliath.” But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions “perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,” and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley’s executives have “become very introspective” and are “really reflecting on what they wrought.”
That more diplomatic approach — and Buttigieg’s avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook — “has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,” said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who’s hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg’s refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
“He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn’t want to offend anyone powerful,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. “Take a position.”
------------
WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Support it:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else… That’s why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.”
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: “Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.”
On the fence:
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Breaking up Facebook is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told the Associated Press, saying Warren “has a very strong case to be made.”
Sen. Kamala Harris: “We have to seriously take a look at that… [Facebook] is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s got to stop.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders: “We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives — including our government. It’s time to take that power back.”
Voiced concerns about it:
Sen. Cory Booker: “I don’t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It’s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, ‘I’m going to break up you guys.’”
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke: “I’m not sure if having five more Facebooks — if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies — makes as much sense as regulating them.”

Texto completo: On a Wednesday in February, Barry Burden was deep into a speech analyzing Wisconsin's 2018 election results when he arrived at the last slides of his PowerPoint.
Those graphs caused some in his Downtown Rotary audience to smile ruefully, look at one another and shake their heads.
Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist and a pre-eminent elections expert, had charted last fall's votes from all 99 Wisconsin Assembly districts the first slide by district number, the second by Republican vote share.
Burden explained how his charts depicted how Republicans, who unilaterally drew the legislative boundaries a decade ago, won an overwhelming majority of seats, typically with 55 percent to 65 percent of the vote.
"This is healthy enough to allow them to win comfortably, but narrow enough that Republican- leaning voters are spread across many districts in an efficient manner," he explained to me this week. "It is a highly effective gerrymander."
The dots on one chart formed a sort of red snake of close but comfortable GOP victories. Almost all Democratic winners, by comparison, were packed into fewer deeply blue districts. In a way words cannot, the charts illustrated what GOP gerrymandering on steroids looks like.
They also explained why even though Wisconsin voters in aggregate favored Democratic Assembly candidates by 53 percent to 45 percent, Republicans maintained a preposterous 63-36 majority in that chamber.
These days, that gaudy margin enables Republican Speaker Robin Vos to claim a political stature rivaling that of Tony Evers, the Democratic governor. While the maps are being litigated, they have fundamentally altered the Wisconsin governmental landscape for all of this decade.
That's your Republican Party. If they cannot win on popularity of policies, they pretty much cheat, which is certainly the modus operandi in Washington, D.C., led by President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Democrats tend to want to play fair, or at least believe that bending or breaking the rules will backfire. Republicans suffer no such pangs of conscience.
That's what was off-putting about Joe Biden's statement when he joined the presidential campaign: that Trump not the GOP itself is what is wrong in American politics.
Speaking in Dubuque, Iowa, Biden said he knows how to successfully work with Republicans. He said this even though, as vice president, the GOP prioritized blocking President Obama over any national interest.
He characterized the Trump administration as "an aberration," adding that "this is not the Republican Party."
The New York Times said Biden's approach showed a "fault line" in Democratic politics between those who see Trump as a singular scourge and others who see an essentially corrupt party whose leaders deny science, attack respected institutions, demonize the free press and stoke racial hatred.
Biden's apparently Pollyannaish attitude comes at a moment when Trump claims he is above any law and has turned Attorney General William Barr into a sycophantic personal lawyer.
In considering the GOP's evil brilliance, just look at the judiciary. It has effectively turned both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Wisconsin Supreme Court into arms of the Republican Party.
At the federal level, jamming through deeply flawed nominees like Brett Kavanaugh assures that Supreme Court votes will be reflexively conservative for years, maybe decades, to come. Lament all you like the story of Merrick Garland, who had every right to be seated but was blocked. His name is now a political footnote.
At the state level, the right-wing justices who form the state Supreme Court majority recently ruled against Evers in a case related to the GOP's lame duck efforts to limit Evers' authority before he took office. Some surprise, eh? We might as well have had Vos and GOP Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald issuing those rulings.
As demographics change and conservative white males lose influence, what better tactic than to pack the judiciary as a long-term firewall against popular will?
Christopher Kang, chief lawyer for Demand Justice, a progressive group fighting for judicial balance, described that in the Daily Beast recently: "Republicans have long understood that the courts are central to implementing their extreme, unpopular agenda. It should be no surprise that when Republicans have power, they manipulate and leverage it to the greatest extent possible to achieve their highest priority: packing the courts with narrow-minded judges who will favor corporations and the powerful, while turning back the clock on our rights, for generations."
Kang described how the GOP has disregarded "blue slips," a U.S. Senate tradition since 1917 that allowed senators to object to judicial nominees from their home states, and also kicked the nonpartisan American Bar Association out of its traditional role evaluating potential judicial nominees.
"When the Senate rules got in their way," he wrote, "Republicans invented the 'nuclear option' and gained leverage by threatening to change the rules with a simple majority vote, instead of the required super-majority."
Obama, for all his strengths, long failed to understand that the GOP prioritized delegitimizing him over serving the country.
Yes, too often it seems that Democrats get hung up on fairness, or at least the optics of fairness.
So where does this leave us?
The Democratic Party needs leaders who can at once match the GOP's politics-as-war tactical acumen while not painting the entire Republican Party as vile and corrupt. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi comes to mind.
But back to Biden.
In a Washington Post op-ed, Max Boot noted that there was a mind-boggling 9 percent of voters who supported Obama and then Trump. Demonizing the entire Republican Party, he wrote, might push these voters deeper into Trump territory and deepen the partisan divide that is tearing the country apart.
I suppose.
In a Washington Post poll last January, 32 percent of Republican respondents said they preferred a GOP nominee other than Trump. Such Republicans might abandon the party, the thinking goes, but not with caustic indictments of the entire party.
OK, then, Democrats need to thread this needle.
But along the way, it would be nice if it didn't seem like they were always getting outplayed. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund ; Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times

Texto completo: El vicegobernador de Louisiana, Billy Nungesser , sorprendió el martes al presidente Donald Trump al vestir unos calcetines con el rostro y peinado del mandatario.
Nungesser dio la bienvenida al presidente Trump al Aeropuerto Internacional de Chennault en Lake Charles, Louisiana.
El fotógrafo del New York Times, Doug Mills, tomó una imagen foto de Nungesser levantando su pantalón para revelar los calcetines, que tienen tela extra para imitar el mechón de cabello de Trump, los cuales señaló el presidente.
En redes sociales la imagen desató miles de comentarios y seguidores de Trump incluso buscan comprarlos, pero también hubo muchas bromas.
“En caso de que alguien no lo sepa, esta persona que le muestra al presidente Trump que no solo tiene calcetines Trump, sino que también tiene el pelo de imitación de Trump, es el vicegobernador de Louisiana”, escribió David Freedlander.

Hillary Clinton's loss provided the nation a great service

Texto completo: Every time I see the latest economic news, I thank Hillary Clinton.
Every time I see those high GDP numbers (up 3.2 percent last quarter), I thank Hillary.
Every time I see those record low unemployment numbers for blacks, Latinos and women, I thank Hillary.
If she hadn't been such a horrible candidate in 2016, there's no telling what sorry state America would be in right now.
So thank you, Hillary, for being such a loser. You did your country a greater service than you'll ever know.
I don't really blame Hillary too much for refusing to accept her embarrassing defeat and deciding to spend the rest of her public life posing as a professional victim of a conspiracy that never happened. In the pretend world where she lives, the Trump-hating Democrats running the House of Representatives and the Trump-hating Democrats running the mainstream liberal media want to re-investigate the Russian collusion delusion from scratch.
They're still deluding themselves about bringing down Trump and they know it. They know that even if the House impeaches Trump, the Senate won't impeach him in a million years.
In other words, the Democrats know their multiple hearings are nothing but partisan TV stunts designed to constantly smear Trump and his family and discredit Attorney General William Barr before he digs up the dirt about the FBI's rogue spying operation on the 2016 Trump campaign.
The good thing is, you don't have to bother watching the House's hearings live or pay attention to how the committees vote. Everyone already knows exactly what the final scores are going to be — straight party-line votes in favor of the majority Democrats' efforts to impeach, probe or immediately hang the president.
Meanwhile, the liberal media never get around to asking the Democrats in the House why they aren't busy writing new legislation to reform health care or fund infrastructure repair.
Come on, Nancy. It's time to send your new legislation over to the Senate so it can be sent over to be signed by the President. Where is it?
While the liberal media keeps busy finding new ways to hate Trump, a hundred Democratic presidential wannabes who hope to go on their party's suicide mission in 2020 are wandering around Iowa, hating on Trump, doing bad impersonations of socialists and making wilder and wilder promises they can't keep.
"Medicare for all," free college for all, "free" federal money for all deposited in a bank account every year just for being born a future Democrat. Wouldn't it be nice if a journalist at CNN, MSNBC, CBS or the New York Times seriously challenged one of these irresponsible promise-makers?
Instead of the usual softball question, what if Wolf Blitzer threw a surprise fastball at the head of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? What if he asked them something complicated like, "What do you think about passing legislation to end the monopoly protections given in each state to healthcare companies and allowing the companies to sell insurance across state lines?"
"I think it's called 'competition,'" Wolf could say. "It allows consumers to shop around for the best deal for themselves and their families. It's worked pretty well with cars, TVs and vegetables. Do you think it might work with health care?"
Don't worry. No one in the mainstream media will ever dare to ask that kind of question to a Democrat. They're only asked questions that can be answered with "I really really hate Trump."
Let's face it, we're going to have this kind of anti-Trump insanity in America for the next 18 months. The deranged mainstream media — electronic and what's left of print — is never going to go back to presenting what we used to call "the news."

Biden talks tech crackdown

Texto completo: HAMPTON, N.H. — Joe Biden said on Monday that he would be open to breaking up Facebook, a sign of the deep skepticism among many Democratic presidential contenders about the power of massive technology firms.
In an interview with The Press, the former vice president who is running for the White House said that dismantling large technology companies including Facebook is “something we should take a really hard look at.”
His 2020 rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, has been the most outspoken Democratic presidential candidate to press for greater regulation of Silicon Valley’s most prominent companies. While Biden didn’t fully embrace her proposal — saying it’s “premature” to make a final judgment — he praised Warren and said she “has a very strong case to be made” for cracking down on tech giants.
The comments demonstrate how Facebook is increasingly a flashpoint in the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, with some candidates arguing the influence of such companies is unchecked, allowing misinformation to poison the public debate. Sen. Kamala Harris, of California, said this weekend that she was open to revamping Facebook, telling CNN the company is essentially a public utility. But Sen. Cory Booker, of New Jersey, told ABC that such calls aren’t very different from the tough tactics President Donald Trump takes against his enemies.
Regardless of whether Facebook is ultimately broken up, Biden told the AP, the Trump administration hasn’t done enough to enforce antitrust laws in a variety of industries.
The former vice president is making his first trip to New Hampshire this week as a declared candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He’s dominating the early polls but faces questions about whether he can keep the momentum going.
The New Hampshire swing comes amid a rapidly escalating trade war between the U.S. and China that has left financial markets spinning and many observers uncertain about what will happen next. Biden’s past support for free trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement could prove to be a vulnerability among the blue-collar union workers he’s targeting. Biden said he didn’t regret voting for NAFTA during his time in the Senate.
“Fair trade is important,” Biden said. “Not free trade. Fair trade.”
Biden is competing in a field that’s been celebrated for its historic gender and racial diversity. He said there are women currently running for president who would be qualified to lead the presidential ticket next year, but he wouldn’t fully commit to selecting a woman as his running mate if he becomes the Democratic presidential nominee.
“I wouldn’t hesitate to pick a woman if that person is the most qualified person available,” Biden said. “I would place no restriction, were I the nominee, on anyone I’d pick, assuming they had the same basic philosophic view of the world as I do.”
It’s important, Biden said, for the nominee to pick a running mate “in line with what they believe … so you can work as a team.”
And if he doesn’t get the nomination, Biden didn’t dismiss the idea of working in a future Democratic administration.
“I learned a long time ago, don’t rule out anything,” Biden said. “If I can be helpful if I weren’t the nominee, I would do whatever I could.”
Biden also addressed questions about a potential conflict of interest stemming from his son’s work for a Ukrainian gas company while Biden was vice president. The New York Times has reported Biden pressured Ukraine’s government to dismiss a top prosecutor believed to be tolerating corruption. The prosecutor was looking into the firm, Burisma Holdings. Biden denied Hunter Biden’s work for the company had anything to do with the effort.
“We never once discussed it when he was there,” the former vice president said of his son. “There’s not a single bit of evidence that’s been shown in any reporting that’s been done that he ever talked about it with me or asked any government official for a favor. … I have great confidence in my son. He’s a man of great integrity.”
Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, scrapped plans this week to visit Ukraine in part to find information that could damage political rivals, including Biden. The former vice president dismissed such efforts.
“When folks like the president and Rudy Giuliani roll through one time selling snake oil, maybe people buy it,” he said. “Second time around, they kind of catch on.”

Kathleen Breen Combes to retire from Boston Ballet, become executive director of Festival Ballet Providence

Texto completo: Kathleen Breen Combes , a star of Boston Ballet who has earned acclaim everywhere from Boston to New York and London, is retiring from the company after 16 years to become the new executive director of Festival Ballet Providence.
The principal dancer's final performance — in Paulo Arrais 's “ELA, Rhapsody in Blue" — is scheduled for June 9.
“This job was kind of a catalyst, and I was waiting for something that I felt really passionate about, and it came about and it just felt like the perfect time," Breen Combes, 37, told the Globe on Monday. “This is a good reason to end, and I feel really good about where my career is right now. It just really worked out perfectly."
During her tenure at Boston Ballet, Breen Combes received a bachelor's degree in organizational communication and a graduate certificate in nonprofit management from Northeastern University. She had always been interested in the organizational and administrative side of Boston Ballet, she said, and while on maternity leave in 2015-16 she began to work with the company's artistic administrative staff.
“This is an exciting new chapter for all of us and I'm delighted to welcome Kathleen to this role," Festival Ballet Providence artistic director Mihailo Djuric said in a statement. “I have known her for many years, both on and off stage, and I admire the intelligence, creativity, and charm she brings to everything she does."
“I'm grateful for the experience she was able to gain at Boston Ballet both on and off stage and I know she will use her many talents to bring a fresh energy and enthusiasm to this role," Djuric added.
As a dancer, Breen Combes has been hailed by critics for her brilliant technique, expressivity, and flair — “a ballerina of colossal scale and boldness," wrote New York Times critic Alastair Macaulay .
Breen Combes said her long-term experience as a ballerina with one company will help give perspective and insight to her work in a leadership position.
“As much as my education is really important, I think that I have learned so much as a ballet dancer that is transferable to this new role," Breen Combes said. “I've spent so many years performing under pressure. I've had to make split-second decisions onstage. I've learned about dedication, resiliency, working in a team, being a leader, and also getting feedback and applying that immediately."
She said her enthusiasm for her new role is bolstered by “the fact that I absolutely love this art form."
“It's not just a job for me," she said. “This has been my life's passion."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr tapped Connecticut's chief federal prosecutor, John Durham, to assist in an investigation into the origins of the Russia inquiry and the FBI's surveillance activities, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.
Durham, a mob-busting federal prosecutor for more than three decades, has assisted the attorney general for several weeks to determine whether federal investigators acted appropriately in the early stages of the now-completed inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
Barr announced that he had launched the review last month during an appearance before a Senate subcommittee. He expressed concern about the FBI's use of surveillance involving associates of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign as authorities sought to understand Russia's interference efforts. Barr said he did not know whether officials had done anything wrong.
"Spying on a campaign is a big deal," Barr told lawmakers. "I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. "
The attorney general said he planned to examine the "genesis and the conduct" of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
"I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred," Barr told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee. "I am concerned about it. There is a basis for my concern. "
Durham has led several high-profile special investigations, including an examination of the FBI's handling of criminal informants in Boston during the Clinton administration, which led to the prosecution of former agent John Connolly. He led an inquiry during the George W. Bush administration into the CIA's destruction of videotapes depicting the torture of terror detainees.
“It’s inconceivable to me that the appointment of someone with John Durham’s record would be considered unless the use of a grand jury was contemplated,” said former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who tapped Durham for the CIA review.
President Trump enthusiastically endorsed Barr's action.
"I am so proud of our attorney general that he is looking into it," Trump said Tuesday.
Democrats seized on Barr's use of the term "spying," asserting that the attorney general sided with Trump to disparage the 22-month investigation, which the president repeatedly described as a "witch hunt. "
Last week, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was unaware of any evidence indicating the FBI abused its surveillance authority, distancing himself from the attorney general. "That's not the term I would use," Wray told the same Senate committee, referring to the "spying" reference.
Rod Rosenstein, until recently the Justice Department's second-in-command, said in a speech Monday that based on what he knew in 2017, "the investigation of Russian election interference was justified, and closing it was not an option. "
The review involving the attorney general and Durham marks the third such inquiry into aspects of the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. It was first reported late Monday by The New York Times.
The Justice Department's inspector general is conducting a review of surveillance warrants authorities used to eavesdrop on a former campaign aide, Carter Page, in October 2016. Barr said that effort should be completed by late May or June. The chief federal prosecutor in Utah, John Huber, is in the midst of a separate review.

Rod Rosenstein calls James Comey a 'partisan pundit'

Texto completo: Rod Rosenstein called his old boss, former FBI Director James Comey, a “partisan pundit” in a speech Monday evening.
The swipe comes after Comey said his former deputy, who oversaw special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, was lacking “sterling character, strong character.”
“Now the former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul,” Rosenstein told the Greater Baltimore Committee. “That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors.”
Tweet
Comey reacted to Rosenstein calling him a "partisan pundit" on Monday with five words. "I wish him the best," Comey told CNN.
The speech comes less than a week after Comey participated in a CNN town hall to mark the two-year anniversary of getting fired by President Trump. CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Comey about a New York Times op-ed in which he wrote the president corrupted Attorney General William Barr and Rosenstein.
“I think people like that, like Rod Rosenstein, who are people of accomplishment but not real sterling character, strong character, find themselves trapped. And then they start telling themselves a story to justify their being trapped which is, 'Yeah, he's awful but the country needs me,’” Comey said.
Comey routinely criticizes the president. A former Republican, Comey has urged Americans to vote for Democrats in 2020.
Rosenstein wrote the memo Trump publicly used as justification to fire Comey in May 2017. It criticized the former FBI director for his handling of the Hillary Clinton emails investigation.
With Mueller's investigation completed, Rosenstein ended his decades-long tenure with the Justice Department last week. In his Monday evening speech, which followed a commencement address at the University of Baltimore, Rosenstein defended his actions, including writing the Comey memo at Trump's request.
“Nobody said that the removal was intended to influence the course of my Russia investigation,” he said. “I would never have allowed anyone to interfere with the investigation,” he added.
Mueller investigated whether Trump obstructed justice in 10 separate instances, including when he fired Comey, but did not make a determination on the matter. Barr said he made the decision with Rosenstein that there was not sufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, but Democrats in Congress want to investigate further.
Rosenstein said he “recognized that the unusual circumstances of the firing and the ensuing developments would give reasonable people cause to speculate about the credibility of the investigation.”

Texto completo: Risotto takes a little time, but it's fairly easy to prepare if you're patient - just stir, stir and stir some more.
I added asparagus and arugula microgreens for color, but you could substitute peas or use no vegetables at all.
Be sure to use arborio rice, a starchy short-grain rice that cooks to a creamy consistency. You can find it in most larger grocery stores and Italian markets.
6-7 cups chicken, vegetable or garlic broth or stock, as needed
Salt and freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
½ cup finely chopped onion or 2 shallots, minced
1 pound mushrooms, cleaned and sliced into pieces
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or chopped sage
1½ cups arborio rice
½ cup dry white wine
1 cup of asparagus slices
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
Handful arugula microgreens for garnish, optional
Bring stock or broth to simmer in a saucepan, with ladle nearby. Make sure stock is well-seasoned and keep it simmering on the stove.
Heat oil in a wide heavy nonstick skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add onions or shallots and cook gently until just tender, 3-5 minutes.
Turn up heat and add mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until they begin to sweat, about 3 minutes, then add garlic and thyme or sage.
Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper and continue to cook over medium heat until soft. Taste and adjust seasoning.
Add rice and stir until grains begin to crackle. Add wine and cook, stirring, until wine is no longer visible in pan.
Stir in enough simmering stock to just cover the rice. The stock should bubble slowly. Cook, stirring often and vigorously, until stock is just about absorbed.
Add another ladle or two of stock and continue cooking, stirring often and adding more stock when rice is almost dry, for 15 minutes.
Add asparagus and continue adding stock and stirring for another 10 minutes. Rice should be tender all the way through but still al dente. Taste and adjust seasoning.
Add another ladle or two of stock to rice. Stir in parsley and Parmesan, and remove from heat.
Season with black pepper and garnish with arugula microgreens, if using.
Serve right away in wide soup bowls or on plates.

Homeless in the valley: Join us for a special event

Texto completo: Homelessness, Gavin Newsom said last week, is "a stain on the state of California." People, the governor added, "are outraged by it, they are disgusted by it, they are wondering what the hell is going on in Sacramento, and they should."
It's not just politicians in Sacramento that people are wondering about: Here in the Coachella Valley, too, many people are asking: It seems our homeless population is growing – is that true? Why? What is being done to help people? What kind of assistance, and programs, are effective? Is there anything I can do to be part of the solution?
You care.
We know this because several months ago, Desert Sun reporter Nicole Hayden — who works full-time writing about health and homelessness — launched a series called "You asked, we answered." She invited readers to submit questions about homelessness, then went out and found the answers.
Among the questions she answered: How can people help those who are homeless in the Coachella Valley? How is money being spent on homeless services in the Coachella Valley? Why did Roy's Desert Resource Center close in Palm Springs?
We've collected all the answers in one place online: homeless.desertsun.com.
But that's not all Nicole has been up to. She and photographer Jay Calderon spent months tracking what happened when Caltrans cleared 60 people from an encampment on public land in Coachella — and why, despite the government spending over $630,000, only about half of those moved off the property ended up in housing.
Then, she decided to go even deeper. Nicole received specialized training thanks to a University of Southern California Annenberg Center for Health Journalism 2019 Data Fellowship. Nicole decided that to answer critical questions about the health of people experiencing homelessness in our community, she needed to develop her own survey to ask people on the streets about access to care, their well-being, and problems they are facing.
Nicole marshaled help from other reporters in our newsroom. Together, they went to shelters and hit the streets to interview 200 people experiencing homelessness from Palm Springs to Indio.
This is no small feat: According to the 2018 point-in-time homeless count, 438 people were experiencing homelessness in the Coachella Valley during a single night in January of that year. That means The Desert Sun team interviewed perhaps 45% of homeless people in our community, an astoundingly high number.
Her results may surprise you. I know they surprised me.
She found that 86% of homeless people in our community actually have health insurance, and 55% said that dental work is their greatest need. "Respondents reported that they found it challenging to get a job if they had missing or rotted teeth," she wrote. And, while Nicole found that there are providers in the Coachella Valley who offer free or reduced-cost dental work, from minor things like fillings to larger procedures like denture work, many people aren't aware that these services exist.
I invite you to check out Nicole's ongoing reports on homelessness in our community at homeless.desertsun .com.
I am beyond proud of Nicole's work. But we aren't stopping there. To truly bring this conversation into the community, encourage empathy, and drive toward solutions, we are putting on a special live event on May 30 at the University of Riverside's Palm Desert campus.
Please join us to hear live storytelling from individuals including:
Nora Soliz, who was homeless in Coachella for seven years
Julie Hernandez, who ended up at a shelter in Indio when she was in high school because her mother was struggling with substance abuse. She's now a caseworker at Martha's Village and Kitchen.
Greg Rodriguez, a policy advisor for Riverside County Supervisor V. Manuel Perez, who will be sharing his personal experience with homelessness.
Nicole Hayden herself, who will share stories from covering homelessness day in and day out.
The evening will also feature opportunities to learn about groups in our community that are actively involved in trying to reduce homelessness. Representatives from Desert AIDS Project, Health to Hope clinics, Coachella Valley Rescue Mission, Martha's Village and Kitchen and more will be on hand sharing about the services they offer and how you can get involved.
Tickets are $12 for adults and $8 for students and are available at tickets.desertsun.com. Free tickets are available for anyone experiencing homelessness — simply write to me with your request at julie.makinen@desertsun.com.
This is information — and an experience — that you won't get from The New York Times, FOX News, or frankly, any other media outlet.
No other local media organization is as committed to covering this topic as The Desert Sun.
If you value this kind of local journalism that's aimed at making our community a better place for all who live here, I urge you to support us. Tell your friends about the high-quality reporting we are doing. Give a friend a subscription — in print, or digitally. Contribute to our fundraising efforts.
And join us in person at UCR Palm Desert. Hope to see you on May 30.

Trump's boasts about dodging taxes show why Congress needs his returns

Texto completo: Legal scholar says taxes aren't just 'sport' for others
The disclosure this past week that Donald Trump accumulated a staggering $1.17 billion in losses from 1985 to 1994 was not, in itself, terribly surprising to anyone who has followed the president's financial travails. That's because the same New York Times reporters who broke the story - and who won a Pulitzer Prize for their prior investigations into his personal finances - had previously unearthed state tax returns from 1995 showing that he claimed tax losses of close to $1 billion. What's truly stunning, however, is how Trump responded to the news.
Rather than attributing the losses to business troubles from which he ultimately bounced back, the president insisted instead that the losses were conjured up to avoid taxes. "Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. "Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered 'tax shelter,' " he continued, adding that for developers like him, tax ploys were "sport."
Never mind that the 1990s were not by anyone's count "more than 30 years ago" (math has never been our commander in chief's strong suit). What's astonishing about Trump's tweetstorm is that the president of the United States - who has a constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws, including the tax laws, are faithfully executed - was gloating about his efforts to skirt the tax code. And he did this in full view of his 60.1 million Twitter followers, only some of whom are Russian bots. The man who sits two rungs above the IRS commissioner in the executive branch's organizational chart bragged that tax dodging was one of his pastimes.
Some of Trump's tax-minimization moves were, concededly, kosher. It's perfectly legal to claim real estate depreciation deductions, which are intended to reflect the gradual decline over time in the value of buildings and fixtures. Far more dubious, however, were Trump's attempts to write down his debts in the early 1990s without reporting the forgiven loans as income on his tax returns. And Trump's efforts to minimize estate and gift taxes on transfers of wealth from his father, Fred, sometimes amounted to - in the Times' words - "outright fraud."
Of course, anyone who has been following Trump-related tax news over the past several years should know by now that the president's attitude toward tax compliance is cavalier, if not contemptuous. Still, seeing him brag about bilking the IRS should shake every American who strives to fulfill her or his taxpaying obligations. Trump's tweet is reminiscent of a remark attributed to real estate mogul Leona Helmsley, who supposedly said that "only the little people pay taxes." The difference is that Helmsley landed in prison, while Trump landed in the White House.
All of which makes the Times' revelations - and Trump's nonchalant response - directly relevant to the escalating battle over his tax returns. The perception that the president is a tax cheat, a perception perpetuated by his own words, presents a genuine difficulty for the federal tax system. That system relies on voluntary compliance - the idea that individuals and firms will report their income honestly and pay their taxes promptly without the IRS having to track them down. It's a system that ultimately rests on the faith of the citizenry. When the man on top boasts that taxpaying is beneath him, that essential faith frays.
For this reason, and to assure Americans that taxes aren't just for the little people, the IRS has established a special procedure to audit the returns of every sitting president and vice president - a procedure designed to reduce the risk that enforcement will be skewed to favor our leaders. But this procedure does not, according to the IRS's internal manual, apply to returns filed by the president's business enterprises. That might have seemed like a minor omission with respect to past presidents, who placed their assets into blind trusts beyond their control. But for Trump, who reportedly receives regular updates on his businesses and retains authority over them, it's a gaping hole.
The IRS's special procedure for presidential audits also does not appear to apply to returns filed by Trump before 2017 that were still under examination when he took the oath of office. According to a statement by Trump's lawyers during the presidential campaign, his returns dating back to 2009 were still under IRS review. The IRS, in other words, has recognized the need for a special presidential audit to mitigate the risk of bias but has not applied this procedure to some of the examinations for which the bias risk is highest.
The House Ways and Means Committee, which has oversight responsibility over the IRS and the tax system more broadly, has responded to well-founded concerns about presidential tax noncompliance by initiating an inquiry into the IRS's audits of Trump and his enterprises. To that end, Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) has requested that the agency hand over filings by Trump and several of his businesses - including returns filed before he became president that were still apparently under audit when he entered the White House. A specific statute, which has been on the books for 95 years, requires the IRS to comply with that request, and Trump's treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, acknowledges that the IRS must do so as long as there is a "legitimate" purpose for the request.
Nonetheless, Mnuchin told the House on Monday that there was no legitimate reason for the Ways and Means Committee to see Trump's returns. That was a puerile claim at the time Mnuchin made it, since surely the committee has a legitimate reason for seeking to verify that the IRS is applying the same standards to the president that it applies to everyone else. Two days later, though, Trump's tweets exposed Mnuchin's argument as patently preposterous. Our famously fitness-phobic president has proclaimed that tax dodging is an athletic activity, yet the treasury secretary maintains that Congress has no cause for concern.
While the urgency of the Ways and Means Committee's inquiry should have been apparent already, Trump's tweets are one more reminder. If the president won't release his returns to the public, then the least we can demand is that a bipartisan panel review those filings and assure us that the president is not a tax scofflaw - and if he is, that the IRS isn't letting him off the hook. Until then, ordinary Americans will have reason to wonder why they are working hard to fund a government whose leader seems to think that taxpaying is just for chumps.

Texto completo: For
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., spelled out the stakes after the committee’s vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to provide the unredacted Mueller report and related documents.
“We are now in a constitutional crisis,” Nadler told reporters.
Indeed, if President Donald Trump can dream up a preposterous executive privilege claim to try to stop Barr from testifying and from producing the entire special counsel report, to prevent the star witness in the obstruction of justice probe (Donald McGahn, former White House counsel) and possibly to block Robert Mueller from testifying, we have no oversight process, no check on a lawless president and no accountability to the American people for the president’s actions.
It’s critical to keep in mind five political and legal points.
First, the basis for the Office of Legal Counsel memo has been obliterated. If the attorney general can render a judgment on indictment, but use the excuse the president cannot be indicted in office and then block Congress from access to material and to witnesses essential to consider even the possibility of impeachment, we would have constitutional chaos. A president would be motivated to break the law, the attorney general motivated to help cover it up and the president’s party motivated to help the president stonewall. If nothing else, the next president must revisit the OLC memo (which many legal scholars think is wrong) so that at least one option is available to deal with a lawless president: indictment or Congress’s full access to materials to consider impeachment.
Second, Congress can argue with Barr, McGahn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (who is withholding Trump’s tax returns that reflect, according to The New York Times, a more than $1 billion loss over 10 years) and their lawyers for months. It can impeach them. However, the best and most effective recourse, I have come to believe, was undertaken in the emoluments case: Go to court.
Congress, as 200 members did in the emoluments case, can file a civil suit directing the president to allow Congress to carry out its constitutional responsibilities (approve or disapprove of foreign payments, investigate the president and consider impeachment). In the case of contempt, Congress can ask both for fines to be imposed (with an order that the person in contempt not receive reimbursement for the fine from the government) and for injunctive action ordering the witness to appear. It’s not swift, but neither will it take months, as some have suggested. Should Trump disobey a court order after appeals are exhausted, there would be no choice but to begin impeachment proceedings.
And that brings us to a third point: One or more of these disputes could well reach the Supreme Court. It was the court’s unanimous decision in the Watergate case (which President Richard Nixon dared not disobey) that made the tapes available and impeachable feasible. If Chief Justice John Roberts has concerns about the legitimacy of the court now, he should know that a decision enabling Trump’s lawlessness would permanently injure the court. For Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, their votes would be a decisive moment for their legacies, an opportunity to show that they are judges, not political lackeys. (Incidentally, state bars have an obligation to make certain those witnesses who are lawyers are conducting themselves in conformity with the professional rules of ethics that, for example, prohibit making bad-faith and frivolous arguments in court.)
Fourth, prosecutors in the cases spun off from the Mueller probe have a special burden: to investigate expeditiously, to preserve their records, to go to the American people and Congress if they are pressured, and then to advise Congress and the public as to their prosecutorial judgment. Likewise, the state of New York, which is not bound by the OLC memo and now has a law allowing it to provide a state tax return to Congress upon request, must forge ahead and render a prompt decision on Trump’s finances.
Fifth, Democrats in Congress as well as those on the presidential campaign trail, cannot ignore this issue. They need to speak with one voice, repeatedly, about the threat Trump poses to our constitutional order. Americans need to hear why this is a big deal and why the president cannot be allowed to prevail.

Yogurt company Chobani has donated nearly $50,000 to help pay off school lunch debt accrued by low-income families in Warwick, R.I., after controversy surrounding an impending school policy about serving cold sandwiches to children led to widespread condemnation and made national headlines this week.
Hamdi Ulukaya, the company's chief executive, pledged the $47,650 to Warwick Public Schools after finding out that the district had planned to serve a sunbutter and jelly sandwich — instead of a hot meal — to students from families who had an outstanding balance on their paid, free, or reduced school lunch account.
The rule was set to go into effect Monday, according to a post that went up on the Warwick Public Schools Facebook page on Sunday.
School officials later walked back the policy after the news sparked outrage across the country, saying Wednesday that “after careful review" a subcommittee is recommending the Warwick School Committee “allow the students their choice of lunch regardless of their account status."
Although the district decided to put the policy on hold, Chobani still wanted to “step up to the plate" and help ensure all kids get a hot meal, the company said.
In a tweet Thursday about its donation, Ulukaya said that as a parent, “news of #WarwickPublicSchools breaks my heart."
“Every child should have access to natural, nutritious & delicious food," he wrote, “so @Chobani is doing our small part."
Ulukaya encouraged others to join the company's efforts. The donation is part of the company's larger goal of calling attention to the “crisis of food insecurity among students" nationwide, according to a press release.
In a telephone interview with the Globe on Friday, Courtney Marciano, press secretary for Warwick Mayor Joseph J. Solomon's office, confirmed that the city will accept the donation from Chobani to go toward paying off a portion of the lunch debt.
She said the money from Chobani and its chief executive will cover the cost owed by low-income families. But because the district's total outstanding lunch debt is around $77,000, officials say, a large portion will still be unpaid.
To help offset the balance, Marciano said the city set up a donations page through the school district's website that allows people to help out if they want to.
“For the many, many generous people offering to make donations to the District, we have posted a donations form," the school wrote Friday. “Thank you again for your generosity – our students thank you as well!"
Marciano said the city has heard that “other donations will be filtering in."
Additionally, a pair of GoFundMecampaigns — launched in response to the sunbutter sandwich policy — have brought in tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of days. The campaigns have raised around $90,000.
Charlotte Clymer, who started one of the online fund-raisers, told the Globe that the goal was to pay off all of the lunch debt for the district.
If the debt gets covered, Clymer said, any leftover money raised should be put toward a national organization that works on this issue.

$1 billion in losses threatens the image of Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has gone to and is going to great lengths to avoid sharing the tax returns he once promised to make public, and now we know at least part of the reason why.
It’s merely the latest revelation that cuts to the core of the myth of Trump.
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that it had gotten its hands on 10 years of Trump’s tax information, from 1985 to 1994. The big takeaway is that it shows massive and consistent losses, totaling $1.17 billion over the entire span.
Needless to say, that’s not the norm. And it was massive, even relative to fellow very-wealthy people. The Times wrote:
“In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer, The Times found when it compared his results with detailed information the I.R.S. compiles on an annual sampling of high-income earners. His core business losses in 1990 and 1991 — more than $250 million each year — were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years.”
Underscore: “More than double those of the nearest taxpayers.”
The Times did not get its hand on Trump’s entire tax returns for these years, so it wasn’t able to conduct in-depth reviews of all the attached schedules. But the top-line numbers are notable — especially given that The Times was able to compare them with the same figures for a pool of one-third of high-income U.S. taxpayers whose figures the IRS makes public (without revealing people’s names). That allowed for the comparison that showed Trump’s losses were nearly unmatched.
The report clearly got Trump’s attention, and he suggested in a pair of tweets on Wednesday morning that he was merely gaming the system and that his losses were “non monetary.”
Trump tweeted: “Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. “You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes … almost all real estate developers did — and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport.”
There are some grains of truth to this.
Real estate developers are able to use depreciation to game the system, to some degree, and avoid paying taxes. Trump reportedly avoided federal income taxes for eight of the 10 years obtained by The Times.
But The Times reports that only a fraction of those losses were the result of depreciation. That suggests this was indeed about Trump’s businesses struggling badly — even as he was authoring The Art of the Deal, which was released in 1987.
And on that front, it’s merely the latest example a new revelation undercutting Trump’s carefully crafted brand as a master businessman.
reported in March on how Trump inflated his wealth to banks with unorthodox “Statements of Financial Condition.” These statements inflated and invented information about his wealth and holdings, while inoculating Trump with lengthy disclaimers.
The same documents showed Trump in 2013 suddenly added a new huge chunk to his net worth: A cool $4 billion for his “brand value” — a number apparently plucked from thin air. The next year this was listed as $3.3 billion for “licensing deals and brand value.” So when Trump claimed early in the 2016 campaign that he was worth more than “TEN BILLION DOLLARS,” a large portion of that was him assigning value to himself. (People charged with estimating wealth don’t assign him near so much value, often putting his net worth around $3 billion or $4 billion.)
Maybe the biggest revelation on this front, though, came from the same reporters who broke Tuesday’s story. In October, The Times detailed an extensive investigation of how Fred Trump’s wealth had been passed to his children, which included Donald Trump. The Times concluded that the methods included “instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents.”
Suddenly, it was clear that the man who suggested he built a $10 billion empire on a $1 million loan from his father — “I had to pay him back with interest!” Trump assured — had a much bigger head start than that. He made the equivalent of $200,000 per year by the age of 3.
None of this disproves the idea that Trump is wealthy. But it does severely diminish the story Trump tells about how he became wealthy, how wealthy he is, and how successful he has been in the business world. Trump fashions himself the self-made master negotiator, but there are now a growing number of data points suggesting he was, in fact, a guy given a massive head start who repeatedly stumbled. And it wasn’t just the failures of his casinos, his airline and various other Trump-branded ventures; it was a steady stream of other failures that Trump has papered over throughout his adult life — and more recently during his time as a politician and president.
Trump in many ways built his career by suggesting that the life story of his political nemesis, Barack Obama, was a fraud. It was the birther stuff. It was Trump suggesting Obama had gotten affirmative action to get into Harvard.
More and more though, it’s Trump’s own personal biography that looks badly embellished and overstated. And that’s got to be at least part of the reason he doesn’t want us to see those tax returns.

Facebook co-founder urges government to break up social media giant

Texto completo: Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is urging the federal government to break up Facebook and reverse its purchases of encrypted messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing platform Instagram.
“We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well-intentioned the leaders of these companies may be,” Hughes wrote in a Thursday op-ed for the New York Times that criticized one-time partner Mark Zuckerberg, who's now CEO. “Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American."
Chris Hughes Facebook
Hughes, who helped Zuckerberg start Facebook from their Harvard dorm room in 2004, provided a road map through the company’s history and explosive growth, and lamented the influence Zuckerberg amassed through his control of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.
“Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithm to determine what people see in their News Feed, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered,” Hughes wrote. “He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”
While Hughes describes Zuckerberg as a “good, kind person,” he said his former colleague's “focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.”
Hughes, whose history with the company gives him a unique vantage point, joins both Democratic and Republican lawmakers taking aim at Facebook, which boasts more than 2.3 billion monthly users worldwide. Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 contender, suggested breaking up the company in March, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed antitrust action against Silicon Valley firms more broadly.
"We already have the tools we need to check the domination of Facebook," Hughes wrote. "We just seem to have forgotten about them.”
Based in Menlo Park, Calif., the company has been rocked by recent scandals involving its handling of user data and the proliferation of harmful content, and conservatives have accused it of censoring them. It's in the crosshairs of federal and international regulators over its privacy practices and is preparing for a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission.
Zuckerberg himself called for tighter regulation in a Washington Post op-ed in March.
Hughes also backed a national privacy bill giving control Americans over their Internet data and called for the creation of a federal agency to regulate tech companies.
“If we do not take action, Facebook’s monopoly will become even more entrenched,” Hughes warned. “With much of the world’s personal communications in hand, it can mine that data for patterns and trends, giving it an advantage over competitors for decades to come.”

Texto completo: ALBANY - The state Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that would allow the state Tax Department to release a president's state tax returns if any of three congressional committees asks for them.
Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, introduced the measure last month in a bid to aid Democrats who control the U.S. House in their efforts to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns. It passed along party lines, 39-21.
Because Trump is a New Yorker, the state Legislature "has a special role and responsibility to assist Congress in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities," Hoylman said Tuesday after the bill passed a Senate committee.
He added Wednesday, "Simply put, no one is above the law, and we have a situation in Washington where a co-equal branch of government has requested tax information from the White House and it is being stonewalled."
The Democrat-controlled Senate passed another bill Wednesday aimed at Trump.
It would allow New York to prosecute Trump associates even if they are pardoned by the president on the federal level.
What happens next? With the Senate approval, the bills now go to the Democrat-led Assembly, where leaders haven't indicated whether it would pass them.
Then they would need the signature of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who, despite being a harsh Trump critic, has indicated he would back the proposal to let the state release Trump's taxes to Congress if it would apply to more than just the president.
The Trump administration has rejected requests by House Democrats to get Trump's federal tax returns.
Since Trump files his taxes in New York, the bill would allow three congressional committees — the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation — to request the state Department of Taxation and Finance to provide the president's state tax returns. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler praised New York's bill, saying it would aid his investigation into the White House.
"This bill is a workaround to a White House that continues to obstruct and stonewall the legitimate oversight work of Congress," he said in a statement.
Republicans ripped both the tax bill and the so-called "double jeopardy" bill, saying they are politically motivated and set dangerous precedents.
"I truly believe that this is pure and simple a political maneuver to attack a sitting president of the United States to score political points in your individual districts," Sen. Thomas O'Mara, R-Big Flats, Chemung County, said on the Senate floor.
The "double jeopardy" bill would let state prosecutors bring charges — even if a presidential pardon was issued. Attorney General Letitia James, a Trump critic, has pushed for the measure.
The bill appears to have the support of Cuomo and the Assembly.
Changing the law Under New York law, sharing state tax return information is prohibited, except under rare circumstances. The bill would create an exemption when the returns are sought by congressional committees in any investigations.
Democrats dismissed Republicans' concerns that it would open all New Yorkers to tax scrutiny by Congress, saying the measure is limited in scope and the IRS already has access to state tax returns.
The bill is one of three Hoylman has introduced to get at Trump's taxes.
One would require all statewide elected officials, including the president and vice president if they file New York income taxes, to release their taxes publicly each year. Another would keep Trump off the state's 2020 ballot if he doesn't release his taxes.
Hoylman said the Senate focused on the tax bill passed Wednesday because it appears to be more urgent, since Trump is fighting with the House over release of his taxes to the congressional committees.
Scrutinizing Trump's taxes The bill's passage in the Senate came a day after The New York Times reported on details of Trump's tax returns from 1985 through 1994, saying he lost more than $1 billion through his business dealings over that span.
On Wednesday, Trump blasted the report, saying the tax filings demonstrated "write-offs" and "depreciation."

"Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted early Wednesday.
Sen. Brad Hoylman is pressing for a law to make President Donald Trump's state tax reurns public.

President defends business losses reported on taxes

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday defended the more than $1 billion he reported in business losses between 1985 and 1994, a previously undisclosed amount revealed in a New York Times investigation, as a best practice that other real estate developers had also used.
Yet even as he tried to explain in a pair of Twitter posts that showing “losses for tax purposes" was considered a “sport" among real estate developers like himself, the president also said the Times' account was “a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!"
It was not immediately clear what specifically in the Times investigation Trump disputed.
The article reported the staggering figure of $1.17 billion in losses between 1985 and 1994, an amount calculated from 10 years of his tax information obtained by the Times. It also raised questions about the image that Trump presented of himself, and whether he is a tarnished, not triumphant, businessman. In some years, Trump appears to have lost more money than any other single taxpayer among an IRS sampling of high earners. Trump has portrayed himself as a self-made billionaire and master deal maker.
The new details about the president's steep financial losses provide the fullest picture yet of his taxes. And his defense of the losses that he reported in the 1980s and 1990s will fuel House Democrats in their fight to get his tax returns for the past six years.
Trump has refused to release his tax returns, bucking a common practice of presidential candidates for the past four decades. Earlier this week, the Treasury Department announced it would not release the tax returns despite a formal request from House Democrats, kicking off a legal battle that will likely go to the Supreme Court.
Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said the revelations about Trump's losses were shocking.
“Trump was perhaps the worst businessman in the world," said Pascrell, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has broad authority to ask for the tax returns of any taxpayer. “His entire campaign was a lie. He didn't pay taxes for years and lost over $1 billion — how is that possible? How did he keep getting more money and where on earth was it all going? We need to know now."
Pascrell insisted that the IRS comply with his committee's request. “We now have another part of the truth," he said. “We need a lot more."
During a weekly meeting with reporters Wednesday, the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, said the new details bolstered Democrats' demand for Trump's tax returns. He dismissed Trump's longtime excuse that he was unable to release them because they were under audit.
“Presumably any time they get a piece of paper from Donald Trump, they put it under audit," he said.
New York Times
Pelosi says Trump is becoming 'self-impeachable'
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, on Wednesday said President Trump is "becoming self-impeachable," pointing to his efforts to fight all subpoenas from congressional investigations and prevent key aides from testifying before Congress.
"The point is that every single day, whether it's obstruction, obstruction, obstruction — obstruction of having people come to the table with facts, ignoring subpoenas . . . every single day, the president is making a case — he's becoming self-impeachable, in terms of some of the things that he is doing," Pelosi said at a Washington Post Live event.
It was not immediately clear what Pelosi meant by "self-impeachable." The House speaker has thus far resisted calls by some members of her party to pursue impeachment proceedings against Trump.
On Tuesday, she made a similar argument about Trump's actions, comparing him to President Richard Nixon and noting that one of the articles of impeachment against the former president was that he ignored congressional subpoenas.
Democrats have repeatedly decried Trump's resistance as stonewalling, maintaining that the president is thwarting Congress's ability to conduct oversight.
Pelosi's interview with the Post's Robert Costa came hours before the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for not complying with a subpoena for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report.
Washington Post
Bush, of 'Access Hollywood' tape fame, returning to TV
More than two years after losing his morning show job because of his appearance in the infamous “Access Hollywood" tape, Billy Bush will return to television in the fall, Warner Bros. announced Wednesday.
He will anchor an entertainment news show called “ExtraExtra," which is distributed by Warner Bros. and will air on a number of local Fox stations beginning in September.
In the final sprint of the 2016 presidential campaign, The Washington Post released a recording from 2005 in which President Trump, then the Republican nominee, could be heard making vulgar comments about groping women while Bush laughed and goaded him on. Bush was recording an “Access Hollywood" segment with Trump on the set of “Days of Our Lives," where Trump was making a cameo.
Bush, 47, was widely criticized for his role in the tape and quickly lost his job as one of the 9 a.m. hosts of NBC's “Today."
In an op-ed in The New York Times a year after the recording was published, Bush said he and the other men on the bus “assumed we were listening to a crass standup act."
“He was performing," Bush wrote of Trump. “Surely, we thought, none of this was real. We now know better."

Times Company Reports Growth in Digital Readers and Advertising

Texto completo: The New York Times Company on Wednesday reported first-quarter results that were better than expected, as gains in digital advertising and subscriptions outpaced the inexorable decline of its once-mighty print business.
The total number of paid subscriptions, including digital and print, topped 4.5 million, a high. More than 3.5 million people pay for the publisher's online products, with the company adding 223,000 customers for its news, crossword and cooking apps during the quarter, a 29 percent increase over last year.
Revenue generated by online advertising was a bright spot. It rose 19 percent, to $ 55 million, helped by the company's podcast business, notably "The Daily." Revenue from the paper's digital subscription and advertising businesses combined rose 16 percent, to $ 165.4 million. (The company does not disclose specific figures for its podcast business.)
The future of the company hinges on digital growth as the print newspaper becomes a specialized product for an ever-shrinking base of readers.
The Times has made steady progress as an online publisher. Last year, it generated more than $ 709 million in digital revenue, making it likely the company will meet a stated goal of $ 800 million by 2020. Earlier this year, Mark Thompson, the chief executive, set another lofty target: to increase the number of subscribers to more than 10 million by 2025.
"We had another strong quarter, and we're continuing to optimize our business to deliver on our goal," he said in a statement.
The company is seeing positive results at a time when newspapers nationwide have been suffering. Last week, the bulk of The Times-Picayune news staff in New Orleans was fired after the paper was acquired from Advance Publications by a rival publication in Louisiana, The Advocate. Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and 100 other newspapers, has laid off reporters across the country and is fending off a hostile takeover bid.
Digital news organizations have also struggled in recent months. BuzzFeed laid off 15 percent of its work force, Verizon announced a 7 percent cut to its media divisions, and Vice Media eliminated about 10 percent of its staff.
At The Times, costs have continued to rise, in part because of increased spending on marketing to help advertise digital subscription products. The company spent $ 47.5 million on marketing during the first quarter, a 50 percent jump over the same period last year. That is likely to continue.
The company's practice of offering heavily discounted promotions has attracted new subscribers, but has also lowered the contribution of each customer. In the first three months of the year, individual subscribers to the core news product generated an average of $ 11.94 in monthly revenue, significantly lower than the $ 14.95 the publisher took in per customer during the same period three years ago. Subscribers to the Crossword and Cooking apps, which are sold separately, have been paying a steadier rate.
Times executives said they expected the average rates of subscription revenue to decline modestly as part of the company's overall strategy to reach 10 million subscribers by 2025. To do so, the company will have to sign up an average of 203,000 new customers every quarter.
Since the so-called Trump Bump at the end of 2016, when The Times booked a record number of subscribers after the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States, the company has generated an average of 200,000 subscribers each quarter. Maintaining that rate of growth will be challenging.
Major news events continue to be a driving force behind new readers, Mr. Thompson said on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday, and The Times plans to invest more in the newsroom.
"The mission of this company is to deliver great journalism to the world," Mr. Thompson said. "We attribute the recent success of our digital strategy to the fact that this mission drives everything we do -- including our investment decisions."
The company separately announced the debut of a new site, Parenting, aimed at "parents who want help having and raising kids today." The site is meant to be a stand-alone service like the Times Crossword or Cooking app, and The Times has the goal of turning it into another subscription product.
As The Times's digital businesses grow, its print operation continues to diminish. Print advertising fell 11.9 percent, to $ 69.5 million, and print subscription revenue decreased 2.6 percent, to approximately $ 161 million.
Operating profit for the first three months of the year was $ 34.6 million, similar to the same period last year, while total revenue rose 6.1 percent, to $ 439 million. Wall Street investors were anticipating an operating profit of $ 27 million on sales of $ 436.5 million.
Last week, the company's shareholders elected two new board directors. Amanpal Bhutani, an executive with Expedia, joined the board in September and was elected by shareholders last Thursday. David Perpich, a fifth-generation member of the Ochs-Sulzberger family that controls The Times, was also elected to the board last week. He runs the paper's product-recommendation site, Wirecutter.
Mr. Perpich is part of a trio of family members who lead the paper. He is a cousin of the publisher A. G. Sulzberger and of Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor who has helped spearhead The Times's video efforts. Mr. Dolnick is one of the executives behind the company's forthcoming television series, "The Weekly," which will air on FX and Hulu in June. The effort is seen as a way to capitalize on the success of "The Daily" and extend the paper's journalism into television and streaming.

In a column Tuesday, Friedman laid out the strategy, which involved the always fresh proposal for a third-party candidate, the willful self-destruction of Republican voters, and the nomination of an exceptional Democrat to do all the rest.
In short, ask Republicans to deliberately lose so that a Democrat wins. Why hadn’t anyone thought of this before?
“We need a Republican who will do the most high-minded, patriotic thing I can imagine today — fall on the Trump grenade,” wrote Friedman.
Ah, yes, a favorite of the national media — the patriotic Republican who gracefully loses to help the Democratic Party. Classic.
Friedman wrote that to be successful, the “patriotic” Republican would need to run to Trump’s “right.” But this apparently confuses the columnist, who thinks this hypothetical Republican would “oppose Trump for his tariffs, his piling up of the national debt, his opposition to immigration and his immorality.”
True, Trump is a liberal on the debt. But the tariffs and the “immorality” could go either way. And immigration, Trump’s most potent issue? On what hot, flat, and crowded planet does Friedman reside where it would be more to the “right” to oppose Trump’s positions on immigration? The only way to be further right than Trump on immigration is to either completely seal off America’s borders or to, I dunno, actually implement any one of the things Trump has said he would.
Friedman also encouraged former White House and Cabinet officials who were reported to have clashed with the president to publicly oppose Trump ahead of 2020. It’s unclear what effect this would have on anything. White House and Cabinet officials didn’t elect Trump. If anything, his supporters are glad they’re gone if it means trying new ways to advance the policies that animated Trump’s campaign, all of which stalled pretty much the minute he was sworn into office.
The final nail in Trump's coffin, according to Friedman, is a Democratic nominee “who can appeal not only to Democrats but also hold the independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women.”
Friedman's phone is undoubtedly ringing off the hook right this moment with 2020 campaign managers seeking this insight.
To recap, all Democrats have to do is get Republicans to self-immolate and hand the election over. Oh, and nominate Jesus, who, according to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, would not have been a Republican anyway.
Friedman further demonstrated that he lives in his own hot, flat, and overcrowded world by claiming in his column that Trump’s “extreme language and behavior” are “stimulating some fringe actors on the right to physically attack people.”
Who on “the right” is Friedman referring to? He offered no examples, and literally the only truly Trump-inspired “attack” was committed by a mentally ill Florida man, "pipe bomber" Cesar Sayoc, who said he never intended to actually hurt anyone. And in fact, no one was ever hurt.
On the other hand, does the name James Hodgkinson ring any bells? Of course not. Liberals in the media erased him — a supporter of Bernie Sanders' 2016 Democratic presidential campaign — from memory after he shot Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., on a baseball field, leaving the congressman physically impaired and relying on a cane to walk.
Democrats can take the White House in 2020. They just need to join Friedman on his hot, flat, and overcrowded planet first.

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - A former White House lawyer defied a congressional subpoena Tuesday, setting the Trump administration on course for another collision with the Democratic-led House over its pursuit of documents related to the Russia investigation.
Don McGahn's refusal to provide the documents to the House Judiciary Committee came at the instruction of the White House, which suggested they could be subject to executive privilege. Such a claim can shield some presidential material from disclosure.
President Donald Trump has defied requests from House Democrats since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report last month. Republicans have largely united behind the president, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday declaring "case closed" on Mueller's Russia probe and potential obstruction by Trump. McConnell said Democrats are "grieving" the result.
Mueller said he could not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. Mueller didn't charge Trump but wrote that he couldn't exonerate him, either.
Democrats say the case is anything but closed and are conducting their own review of Mueller's investigation of Russian election interference.
The Judiciary panel wants to speak to McGahn and review certain documents.
NYT: Trump lost more than
$1 billion from '85-'94
WASHINGTON - The New York Times reported that Donald Trump's businesses lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994, based on tax information the newspaper acquired.
The Times said it has acquired printouts from the future president's official IRS tax transcripts, including figures from his federal tax form.
The newspaper said Trump reported business losses of $46.1 million in 1985, and a total of $1.17 billion in losses for the 10-year period.
After comparing Trump's information with that of other "high-income earners," the Times concluded that Trump "appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer." Because of his business losses, the newspaper reported, Trump did not pay income taxes for eight of the 10 years.

DeVos offers new definition of 'public education'

Texto completo: BALTIMORE – While the media may focus on U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, she told the nation's education reporters Monday that the focus should be on students and families.
"As much as many in the media use my name as clickbait or try to make it all about me, it's not," she said. "Education is not about Betsy DeVos nor any other individual."
Defining herself as a conservative with a distrust of government, DeVos used her appearance at the Education Writers Association annual conference to promote her Education Freedom Scholarships and to continue her call for a redefinition of public schooling.
"It should surprise no one that I am a commonsense conservative with a healthy distrust of centralized government," she said. "Instead, I trust the American people to live their own lives and to decide their own destinies. That's a freedom philosophy."
For DeVos, a wealthy former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman whose Cabinet term has been marked with controversy, that means giving students and families the choice to move between schools. She says this will force traditional public schools to innovate and get better.
It's a familiar mantra for DeVos, who pushed the establishment of charter schools in Michigan and helped to push an unsuccessful school vouchers ballot question in Michigan.
She has proposed an Education Freedom Scholarship, which would use private scholarships to allow students who couldn't normally afford it to go to private schools.
It ties in with DeVos' broader philosophy.
"Let's stop and rethink the definition of public education," she said. "Today, it's often defined as one type of school, funded by taxpayers, controlled by government. But if every student is part of 'the public,' then every way and every place a student learns is ultimately of benefit to 'the public.' That should be the new definition of public education."
DeVos furthered her push for school choice under questioning from New York Times reporter Erica Greene.
"More choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean" better schools overall, even a neighborhood traditional public schools," DeVos said.
During the question-and-answer period with the reporters, a Michigan-based reporter asked DeVos about Detroit schools and the charter schools in the city, which have a generally poor record, as does the Detroit traditional school system and why DeVos hadn't visited the city to talk to families.
DeVos was instrumental in pushing Michigan's charter school law, including through political action groups and donations to Michigan legislators.
DeVos said she had been to Detroit schools before she was education secretary.
She also said she doesn't think Michigan has true education "freedom." She added she hoped that would change.
In other news, DeVos said:
She hasn't met recently with any sexual assault survivors. Her department has proposed a major overhaul of how colleges and universities handle sexual assault complaints, with many sexual assault survivors complaining she is protecting those who are accused of sexual assault.
She said the recent scandal of parents paying bribes to get their children into elite universities showcases the belief among many that the college system is unfair to most average people.
When asked whether she would serve another four years in her role if Donald Trump was re-elected and wanted her to stay, DeVos didn't directly answer, instead quipping that her husband probably wouldn't like her to.

Knee-jerk anti-Trumpism makes you look stupid, Paul-Krugman-has-thoughts-on-Tiger-Woods edition

Texto completo: There is something about reflexive anti-Trumpism that keeps allegedly intelligent people from conducting even the most basic research before spouting off about whatever it is that grieves them so.
This is a real problem.
The New York Times’ Paul Krugman, for example, aired a historically illiterate grievance this week after Trump honored Tiger Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
“I'm old enough to remember when Presidential Medals of Freedom were given for showing courage and making sacrifices on behalf of the nation and the world,” Krugman lamented Monday evening. “Tiger Woods … hits golf balls for money.”
As reality would have it, Woods is the fourth professional golfer to win the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest honor available to American citizens. Former President Barack Obama gave the same award to professional golfer Charles Sifford in 2014. Former President George W. Bush did the same for Jack Nicklaus in 2005 and Arnold Palmer in 2004.
Woods may be a trailblazer in a lot of areas, but winning the Presidential Medal of Freedom is not one of them. This is basic stuff, knowledge that is readily available online or in, you know, books.
Does Krugman not know that a professional golfer won this award just five years ago? Or does the Times columnist know and just not care?
For that matter, is he even thinking of the correct award? Krugman’s bit about “courage and making sacrifices on behalf of the nation and the world” suggests he may be thinking about the Medal of Honor, which is the highest award available for military courage. The Medal of Honor is indeed a somber affair. It is given only to those who commit uncommon acts of heroism in battle.
The Presidential Medal of Freedom, which Krugman suggests has been greatly devalued by Trump awarding it to Woods, has gone to such noble and self-sacrificing heroes as sketch comedy producer Lorne Michaels, baby boomer spokesman Bruce Springsteen, Dairy Queen enthusiast Warren Buffet, actual war criminal Henry Kissinger, and professional teleprompter reader Tom Brokaw.
The Presidential Medal of Freedom is a broadly defined award. It is awarded broadly. Treating it with all the gravity and severity of the Medal of Honor suggests either that Krugman does not know the difference between the two accolades or that he knows the difference but does not realize that the latter is more cheerful than the former.
Lastly, what is this nonsense about devaluing Woods as merely a guy who hits golf balls for money? You can say a lot about Woods, but he certainly meets the award's criteria that the recipient makes an “especially meritorious contribution” to “cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.”
Woods is not only one of the greatest golfers of all time, but he is also the first black man to come this far in this sport. Not to say they performed under the exact same circumstances, but to say Woods is just a guy who “hits golf balls for money” is a bit like saying Muhammad Ali, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005, was just a guy who “punches people for money.”
Just because you do not like Trump does not mean that everything he does is bad or deserving of condemnation. Sometimes, he does a good thing, like awarding an actual and currently active sports pioneer the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Two U.S. senators who lived lives of honor and courage

Texto completo: Let us now praise two almost-famous men who served in the Senate for a combined total of 74 years and died recently within three weeks of each other. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, both took a bipartisan approach to legislating and left their country a stronger, safer place.
Today, lawmakers who dare to reach across the aisle are branded as heretics and threatened with primary challenges. So it’s important to remember a time when working with political rivals to solve problems was not just possible, but popular.
Lugar was compact and colorless, known for his early-morning runs around Capitol Hill, even in lousy weather. A political ally, William Ruckelshaus, once joked about him, "Dick has maintained that childhood capability of walking into an empty room and blending right in."
Hollings was tall and lanky with a crackling wit that sometimes got him in trouble. When a political opponent challenged him to take a drug test, Hollings fired back, "I’ll take a drug test if you’ll take an IQ test." The New York Times once wrote, "Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important."
In many ways, however, their political lives took similar paths. Both were military veterans. Hollings won a Bronze Star as an artillery officer in World War II. Lugar was too young for the war, but time as an intelligence officer briefing the Navy’s top brass deepened his interest in defense and foreign policy.
Hollings was elected governor of South Carolina at age 36. Lugar became mayor of Indianapolis at 35. Both lost their first tries for the Senate, and ran for president with abysmal results. And both represented vanishing political breeds that are sorely missed in Congress today.
Hollings was a pragmatic Southern Democrat in a state that was rapidly turning Republican, and after he retired in 2004, he was replaced by hard-edged conservative Jim DeMint. Lugar, a dedicated internationalist, was defeated in a GOP primary in 2012 by a doctrinaire right-winger, Richard Mourdock.
But the most important trait they shared was a capacity to change, grow and apply their new knowledge to practical legislative solutions. In 1986, Lugar led 31 Republicans in joining 47 Democrats to override President Reagan’s veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions on South Africa. The Republican’s most enduring success was working with Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, to enact legislation that financed the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Washington Post editorialized, "the program ranks as among the most successful congressional foreign policy initiatives in a generation."
One of Lugar’s protÃ©gÃ©s was a young first-term Democrat from Illinois, Barack Obama, who said of his mentor: "In Dick, I saw someone who wasn’t a Republican or a Democrat first, but a problem-solver — an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground."
Hollings grew up in the segregated South, but as governor, he presided over the peaceful integration of Clemson University. "This General Assembly," he told state lawmakers, "must make clear South Carolina’s choice: a government of laws rather than a government of men."
As a senator in the late 1960s, he toured poor areas of his state and became a strong supporter of federal programs like food stamps. "There is hunger in South Carolina," he told a Senate committee. "I know as a public servant I am late to the problem, (but) we’ve got work to do in our own back yard ."
In the 1980s, he worked with Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire to enact the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which placed strict limits on congressional expenditures. It worked for a time, but eventually, clever congressional budget-busters found ways around the restrictions.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of Hollings’ career came in 2015, when he proposed that a federal courthouse named in his honor be renamed for Judge J. Waties Waring, an early and isolated voice for racial equality. "I just got the money for the building, he made history in it," Hollings explained.
The senator was being too modest. Fritz Hollings and Dick Lugar both made history. And today’s lawmakers can learn a lot from their lives of honor and courage. .

Chappelle already has two Emmys and two Grammys.
The Kennedy Center said Tuesday that it had chosen Chappelle as the 22nd recipient of the Mark Twain Prize, according to the New York Times.
Deborah F. Rutter, the Kennedy Center president, said in a statement: “Dave is the embodiment of Mark Twain’s observation that ‘against the assault of humor, nothing can stand.’ For three decades, Dave has challenged us to see hot-button issues from his entirely original yet relatable perspective.”
The prize is a bronze bust of Twain. Chappelle will formally receive the prize on Oct. 27 in a ceremony at the Kennedy Center in Washington.

ABOUT DAVE CHAPPELLE
From the Kennedy Center’s award announcement:
Chappelle was the mastermind behind the 2003 sketch comedy hit, The Chappelle Show — one of the highest rated programs on Comedy Central. The show earned three Emmy® nominations and went on to become the best-selling TV show in DVD history. Feature film credits include Bradley Cooper’s award-winning remake of A Star is Born, Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq, Undercover Brother, Screwed, Blue Streak, 200 Cigarettes, You’ve Got Mail, Woo, Half Baked, The Real Blonde, Con Air, Joe’s Apartment, The Nutty Professor, Getting In, Undercover Blues, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. In 2000, Chappelle recorded his first hour-long special in Washington, D.C. for HBO, Dave Chappelle: Killin’ Them Softly. Chappelle’s second comedy special, Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth, was filmed in San Francisco’s Fillmore Auditorium and aired on Showtime in 2004.
The past few years have been banner for Chappelle. In 2017, he received his first Emmy Award® for his debut episode on Saturday Night Live. His memorable, panoramic monologue was the comic relief the country needed following the 2016 Presidential election that reflected our nation’s deep racial divide. Chappelle celebrated his 30th year in comedy by releasing not one, but four highly anticipated stand-up specials on Netflix. The first two specials, The Age of Spin and Deep in the Heart of Texas, were released in March 2017. That summer, Chappelle took up residency at New York’s Radio City Music Hall, selling more than 90,000 tickets and performing 16 shows that included 58 guests representing the biggest names in comedy and music. He capped off the year by releasing the remaining two specials, Equanimity and The Bird Revelations on New Year’s Eve. All four specials were delivered on vinyl as double-feature albums and received Grammy Awards® for Best Comedy Album in 2018 and 2019. Pollstar awarded Chappelle with Comedy Tour of The Year in 2014 and 2018 and he captured his second Emmy® for Outstanding Variety Special with Equanimity in 2018.

Texto completo: When Christian author Rachel Held Evans died unexpectedly last week from brain swelling, it set off a wave of lament online. After the announcement of her passing, the hashtag #becauseofRHE trended globally on Twitter as people retold stories of how Evans and her work had impacted their lives. A GoFundMe campaign launched to help cover her family’s medical expenses set a goal of $70,000. It has raised more than $200,000.
The widespread outpouring of grief is a testament to the reach of her words, but it also raises questions about why Evans’ passing has struck such a nerve. At a mere 37 years old, her entire career began only in the early 2000s. But the reason that a writer as young as Evans mattered to so many is that, religiously speaking, she was not just a writer. Evans was a prophet with a pen.
In the most formative moments of both Jewish and Christian history, prophets play critical roles in birthing faith’s future. They often emerge in the midst of oppressive situations, when religious leaders have been co-opted by earthly rulers and politicians. In such times, prophets appear from within the religious community to critique it and call it into a new reality.

American churches must reject literalism and admit we got it wrong on gay people
Mayor Pete Buttigieg's countercultural approach to Christianity is what America needs now
I'm not swooning over 'Breakthrough. ' It avoids hard questions about miracles and God.
As Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann says, “Prophets are people who, because of their roots in the theological tradition and because of some emancipatory experience in their own life, refuse to accept the definitions of reality that are imposed upon us by the socioeconomic political power structure. ”
Evans: A writer by the church door
Evans was raised as an evangelical Christian in the South and experienced the many affectations that come with such an upbringing. She sprouted from the soil of the blogosphere in 2008, when the tectonic plates of traditional Christianity in America were shifting. Yet it was her 2010 memoir, “Faith Unraveled,” that gained her a broad hearing among Christians. The book recounted her struggles with the fundamentalism of her childhood and charted out her adult quest to make peace with doubt, science and other religious boogeymen. Evans’ “emancipatory experience” and religious roots resonated with the disillusioned masses with similar stories. She made disillusioned believers feel less alone.
I’ve referred to Evans as a writer who sat by the church door. For those just beginning to explore Christianity, her work greeted you with a reminder that not every Christian resembles the caricatures so often encountered in the news media and entertainment. If you were a believer who was ready to call it quits and walk away from it all, her work beckoned you to stay and reimagine the faith alongside of her.
As Evans matured, her voice grew louder and her opinions became more pointed. Like the prophets of old, her ire was often aimed at the religious aristocracy and political powerbrokers whom she perceived to be agents of injustice and marginalization. Evans spoke out against Christians who ignored the rise of white supremacy, decried pastors who propped up Donald Trump after he was revealed to be a sex abuser, and championed the full inclusion of LGBTQ Christians in the life of the church. Untethered from any institution with power to censure her, Evans was free to say what other Christians were thinking but felt too afraid to say aloud. Over time, she sparked courage in others to add their voice to hers.
Evans used her life to show the truth
“The folks you’re shutting out of the church today will be leading it tomorrow. That’s how the Spirit works,” she once declared. “The future’s in the margins. ”
One of the notable characteristics of prophets in the Jewish Scriptures is their desire to dramatize the truth rather than just preach it. To illustrate God’s coming judgment in their day, Jeremiah smashed a jar and Isaiah wandered naked for three years. Ezekiel ate a scroll to remind people that God’s word is inside our bodies rather than just on the page. It’s not that surprising then that in 2011, Evans took a vow to obey all of the Bible’s instructions for women literally for 12 months. She made her own clothes, stayed silent in church, awoke before dawn, covered her head, and camped out in her front yard while menstruating.
Her experience during this period was cataloged in her New York Times best-selling book, “A Year of Biblical Womanhood,” and it exposed the weaknesses and inconsistencies of conservative Christian views of womanhood and sparked a wide conversation about how to read the Bible’s teachings on gender.
Evans eventually left evangelicalism altogether and became an Episcopalian, but she refused to leave Christianity. Instead, she reimagined what a life of faith could look like. She penned a book rethinking how to relate to the church and another reimagining how to read the Bible. From her new perch in mainline Protestantism where she wrote, Evans regularly critiqued conservative Christian leaders and exclusionary churches. Indeed, critiquing a community from within its walls is an earmark of prophets. Her opponents came to fear her razor wit, but Evans claimed that her critiques were born out of her desire to see Christianity become a more positive presence in the world.
The prophet has penned final words
Of course, when someone dies in the prime of their life, the temptation is to lionize them like Elvis. But Evans was far from perfect, and she’d be the first to tell you that. In her infamous social media spats, her passion sometimes seemed to get the best of her. On more than one occasion, she was forced to issue an apology online for something she said or the way she spoke it. Of course, this willingness to admit her own fallibility only made her more endearing to her followers.
I knew her first as a colleague, and I admired the way her words sparked like struck flint off pages and screens. To spiritual seekers wandering in the dark cave of doubt, Evans wrote as a torchbearer to be trusted. To Christian leaders intoxicated by power and complicit in injustice, she was an arsonist to be feared. She and I did not always agree, and we had a disagreement or two online. Yet we guarded our friendship first, and I never questioned her love for the faith we shared.
As the Catholic mystic Richard Rohr says, “The dualistic mind presumes that if you criticize something, you don’t love it. Wise people like the prophets would say the opposite. ”
In a time of resurgent bigotry and hatred during which many Christians seem content to side with the oppressors over the oppressed, we need Rachel Held Evans more than ever. But she is gone, never to return. The prophet has penned her final words. For more than a decade, she spoke truth to power, never seeking to establish a legacy or ensure that she would be remembered.
Maybe that’s why she is so impossible to forget.

BILLY PORTER A MUST-SEE AT MET GALA

Texto completo: Billy Porter was golden and glorious as he joined that exclusive realm of "must-see" celebrities at the Met Gala, the annual extravaganza to benefit New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute.
"Billy Porter Just Made the Most Fabulous Entrance in Met Gala History," declared Vogue, the organizers of the event. In 11 years of red-carpet favorites such as Beyonce, Rihanna and Sara Jessica Parker pushing the envelope, they had never seen anything like it.
He arrived before the crowd of expected big names, at 5:45 p.m., and had the cameras to himself. The reclining Porter, in a headdress and looking oh-so Ancient Egyptian, entered being carried on a cushioned litter by six shirtless men. When he debarked, he opened his arms to reveal what at first appeared to be a metallic cape, but then he literally spread his wings. Feathers and sparkles were predicted to be must-haves on this year's walk up the steps to the Met, and Porter provided plenty of both in the place where fashionistas come to burst the bubble of the expected.
Porter's "Sun God" attire was designed by The Blonds, David and Phillipe, according to Vogue. It included "a bejeweled catsuit outfitted with 10-foot wings, a 24-karat gold headpiece, as well as custom gold-leaf Giuseppe Zanotti shoes and fine jewels by Andreoli and Oscar Heyman. The mic drop served as half fashion moment, half performance art - perfectly executed on an evening when stars were asked to unleash their utmost creativity."
It was his first time at the Met Gala, where this year's theme was "Camp: Notes on Fashion," inspired by Susan Sontag's 1964 essay "Notes on 'Camp.' " Porter's outfit was in the camp of the spectacle we've come to expect from the event - remember Rihanna's silver pope outfit of last year?
Pittsburgh native Porter's love of hats and bright colors (orange is his favorite) and flowing menswear burst into the mainstream when he walked the Golden Globes red carpet - as a best actor nominee for the FX series "Pose" - in a bejeweled pearl-gray suit and pink-lined floor-length cape that he delighted in spreading out, Batman-style, for the cameras.
The 49-year-old Porter has been having the time of his life since the Broadway role of a lifetime took his career to new heights. As the 2013 Tony and Grammy Award winner for "Kinky Boots," he showed he could rock sequins and heels as a drag diva. As his profile has been raised, he has used his voice to advance the rights of the LGBTQ community while creating a fashion firestorm in menswear.
He took a leap forward to fashion icon at the Academy Awards in February. The singer-actor was there as an ABC preshow co-host, but it was walking the carpet that he set the cameras flashing and tongues wagging.
He collaborated with designer Christian Siriano for a tuxedo gown - a tux up top that flowed into a voluminous ballgown skirt - that was as much the talk of the night as the winners and losers.

We should stop letting Trump troll us What if we just payed attention to what the president actually does instead of jumping up and down about what he says?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has a superpower. With just a few taps to the screen of his iPhone, he can transform his staunchest adversaries into ... Donald Trump.
No one loves a good conspiracy theory as much as the man in the Oval Office. Indeed, that is how he launched his political career. He was the chief propagator for a shameful lie that the nation's first black president was not born in this country.
He continues to gin up new ones. But in addition to using them to stir his own base, Trump has become highly effective at fomenting preposterous scenarios that send his opposition into a conspiratorial frenzy.
The latest example came over the weekend, when Trump retweeted an obvious, if lame, joke by a devoted sycophant.
"After the best week ever for @realDonaldTrump - no obstruction, no collusion, NYT admits @BarackObama did spy on his campaign, & the economy is soaring," Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, wrote. "I now support reparations - Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup."
Reparations - get it? Falwell was sucking up to the president, distorting the results of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possibly illegal effort to obstruct the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and making a racially insensitive reference to redressing the abomination of slavery. It was a three-fer, in less than 240 characters.
Trump continued the trolling with a tweet that read: "they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back."
Traditional and social media took the bait, as Trump surely knew they would.
Out of that tweet came a torrent of speculation about the extralegal means he might use to remain president, no matter the outcome of next year's election.
A Rolling Stone headline pondered: "Will Democrats Have to Do More Than Defeat Trump in 2020 to Get Him Out of Office?"
No less a figure than Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe wrote, "This is as loud a warning as anyone could ask for: Trump has no intention of leaving his sinecure and exposing himself to jail time."
But Tribe also acknowledged: "If he plans to stage his own coup, I'd count on the judiciary, the military, and, ultimately, a popular uprising to stop him. Best = landslide."
Should Trump lose the 2020 election, he surely will howl that the results are illegitimate. Indeed, he suggested that he planned to do it in 2016 had things gone the way that pre-election polls suggested they would.
His former fixer Michael Cohen, who went to prison Monday, told the House Committee on Oversight and Reform in late February: "I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power."
But as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sensibly pointed out to The New York Times, our system provides a straightforward way of settling these things. It comes at the ballot box.
That is what happened in last year's midterm elections, in decisive numbers, up and down the ballot. Our democratic process, which has survived threats far more serious than narcissistic bluster, worked as it was designed to do.
Trump has sent liberals into a panic over something that is not only a fantasy - there is no mechanism to add two years to a president's term beyond a constitutional amendment - but a pointless distraction given the election is still 18 months away. And all of this undermines trust in our institutions, which may be the biggest danger of all.
So I'd like to suggest trying something radical the next time Trump tweets something ridiculous: Ignore it.
There no doubt will be those who say that not jumping on each and every offensive thing he utters is "normalizing" Trump.
But, in fact, it would do the opposite. It would preserve a sense of proportion about Trump's various sins, and keep a focus on the abuses of power that are actually happening right in front of us.
Most immediate among those at the moment is Trump's threat to prevent Mueller from testifying before Congress. Mueller must explain himself in public, and clearly answer whether Trump and his allies - including Attorney General William Barr - have twisted the conclusions of his 448-page report.
Here's a theory to chew on: If the report is truly the exoneration that Trump claims it is, why doesn't he want to let Mueller talk about it?

Mr. Onwuachi's recent memoir, "Notes From a Young Black Chef," details his childhood in the Bronx and Nigeria, as well as the closing of his highly publicized, short-lived fine-dining restaurant, the Shaw Bijou. Since then, inspired by the complex history of the Potomac River waterfront, Mr. Onwuachi has thoughtfully worked toward a dazzling professional comeback, in both his creative work and his efforts to build a more inclusive kitchen environment.
Many of this year's Beard winners have spoken about their commitment to social justice in the restaurant business, including Ashley Christensen of Poole's Diner in Raleigh, N.C., who was named Outstanding Chef. Ms. Christensen is the chef and owner of several restaurants in the South, and has spoken of the challenges she faced building her businesses, and the importance of formal mentorship to a healthier work environment.
Frenchette, a New York restaurant run by Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, was named Best New Restaurant, one of the foundation's most sought-after awards. The New York Times's chief restaurant critic, Pete Wells, gave the popular brasserie three stars in July, noting that "even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m."
Last year, the pastry chef Camille Cogswell was named Rising Star Chef for her work at Zahav, in Philadelphia; this year, the modern Israeli restaurant won the award for Outstanding Restaurant. Kevin Boehm and Rob Katz, of the Boka Restaurant Group in Chicago, won Best Restaurateur for their restaurants Girl & the Goat, Momotaro and others.
In the regional chef awards, Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, the well-respected chefs behind Via Carota and two other restaurants in the West Village of Manhattan, were chosen as Best Chefs: New York. Mashama Bailey, who opened the Grey in 2014 in Savannah, Ga., was named Best Chef: Southeast. Vishwesh Bhatt, an immigrant from India who cooks Southern-, French- and Indian-inflected food at Snackbar in Oxford, Miss., was named Best Chef: South.
Many of this year's winners seem to reflect the judges' new efforts to factor in restaurant culture and leadership values alongside sheer excellence. Last year, in the wake of sexual-harassment allegations against previous winners like Mario Batali, John Besh and Ken Friedman, the foundation announced its intent to recognize "the values of respect, transparency, diversity, sustainability and equality."
In 2018, the foundation gave 11 of 15 culinary awards to women or people of color, a notable change for a roster that has previously skewed male and white. And in October, the foundation announced efforts to make its own operations more inclusive, with volunteer committees that better reflect the United States population, though it will most likely take some years for those changes to fully play out.
Though there have been calls to strip Mr. Batali and other accused chefs of their medals, the foundation has not done so. For some, this calls into question the foundation's new efforts, as well as the ability of any volunteer committee to assess a nominee's moral values when the inequities of the restaurant business are so pervasive behind closed doors.
The foundation also honored food journalists and cookbook authors with awards on April 26 in New York City, where The Times was named Publication of the Year. The full list of chef and media winners is on the James Beard Foundation's website.

Texto completo: So far, he's hitting it out of the park.
Less than one week after Joe Biden announced he's running for president -- again -- he's in an enviable spot. He smashed all 2020 subsequent one-day fundraising records, bringing in a whopping $6.3 million on his first day. A new CNN poll of Democratic candidates shows Biden with a sizable lead at 39%, with Bernie Sanders second at 15%. A Quinnipiac survey has a similar margin with Biden at 38%, with Warren in second at 12% (with Sanders third at 11%).
And his strategy to start his campaign by reminding Americans what President Trump said after the Nazi protests in Charlottesville left one woman dead was met, by all accounts, with its intended reaction. Biden drew Trump into the debate he wants to have -- about moral character -- and Trump responded with a flurry of reflexive tweets. In the words of New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, "What [Trump's] doing is elevating Joe Biden and basically turning this into a one-on-one between himself and Joe Biden
18 months ahead of time."
Of course, Biden still faces plenty of challenges: a far-left wing of his party that dismisses him as insufficiently progressive, decidedly old guard and a vestige of pre-partisan politics. (How dare he, for example, pay Vice President Mike Pence a compliment?)
Finally, there's Mayor Pete. Until Biden jumped in, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg was convincingly occupying the lane Biden was meant to dominate -- moderate Democrats. Buttigieg's enormously effective charm offensive catapulted him to the top of the field. As different as they are in terms of background and resume, Biden and Buttigieg are now facing off for many of the same voters.
Biden could learn something important from the rookie. One of the ways Buttigieg has managed to break through a crowded field has been his stunning accessibility. As Politico recently pointed out, he's made himself available to anyone from Indianapolis Monthly to radio host Charlamagne tha God, an environmental newsletter with 5,000 Twitter followers to a podcast about "The West Wing," Bill Maher to Barstool Sports.
With decades in politics and nearly 100% name ID, it would be intuitive to think Biden didn't really need to take this approach. Where Mayor Pete needs to introduce himself to America, Uncle Joe is already a well-known member of the family.
But this is exactly Biden's problem -- his record is long and our views of him are cemented.
They don't have to be. If he wants to win the Democratic Party's nomination, Biden needs to be like Buttigieg -- everywhere. Not just the predictable platforms like "The View," where he announced his candidacy, or "Good Morning America," where he responded to some of his critics in a taped piece.
Instead of the pre-packaged version of himself he wants us to see in slick, produced videos and well-scripted statements, surrounded by friendly interviewers with big reach, he should go to the podcasts, digital series and off-beat outlets. He should introduce himself to millennials and reintroduce himself to Gen Xers and even boomers. And yes, he should go on Fox News. Nowhere should be too obscure or "not worth the effort."
Anything less and Biden will look entitled, out of touch and, frankly, too tired for the job.
At 76 and with nearly half a century in politics, he'll never be the new kid on the block. But the trick for Joe Biden now is to pretend he is. And that means giving us a Biden we've never seen before.

THE REVOLT OF THE DEMOCRATIC ELITES COASTAL LIBERALS CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY JOE BIDEN IS LEADING THE PACK

Texto completo: Both of our major political parties are undergoing fundamental disruption, but the disruption is coming from different directions. The Republican Party has been disrupted from the bottom. In 2016, the educated Republican elites were happy to embrace conventional Republican themes. It was the Republican base that was fed up and wanted Donlad Trump - something completely different.
The Democratic Party is facing disruption from the top. In the early stages of the current political season, Democratic rank and file seem to be embracing Joe Biden and his traditional Democratic themes. It's the coastal, highly educated elites who are fed up and want something transformative.
In other words, the Republican story is a story of populist radicalization; the Democratic story so far is a story of elite radicalization.
Let's try to unpack what that means.
In 2016, the Republican establishment was happy to support candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Throughout the primary season, Republicans with college degrees consistently preferred mainstream Republican candidates. Those without college degrees were angry and supported Mr. Trump by double-digit margins. This stark split along educational lines became known as the Diploma Divide. In the end the populist class defeated the educated class.
The Diploma Divide among Democrats this year isn't as stark as the one between Republicans in 2016. Mr. Biden is popular among all Democratic groups. For example, according to a recent CNN poll, he's just as popular as Bernie Sanders among people who call themselves "very liberal."
But there may be a growing Democratic Diploma Divide. As Martin Longman points out in Washington Monthly, less-educated, older voters are more likely to support Mr. Biden. Mr. Sanders, with his more outsiderish, disruptive campaign, is more competitive with more educated, younger voters.
What is the difference between those two tendencies? Well, it's not over policies. Democrats of all stripes tend to support similar policy proposals. Matthew Yglesias captured the gap correctly in a 2017 Vox essay. It's about attitudes toward America.
People who support Mr. Sanders and other disrupters are more likely to say politics is a rigged game; they are much less likely to express pride in America. They think our systems are fundamentally screwed up and require radical overhaul. They don't want a candidate who talks like a reformer but governs as an insider - as they think Barack Obama did.
People who support Mr. Biden and the other mainstream candidates are more likely to see the Trump Era as a nightmare aberration. They have more faith in the basic systems of American life and express more pride in America. They think that the civic bargain has been broken but that it can be restored.
Which tendency is going to prevail? In 2016, most of us pundits thought the educated-class Republicans would prevail over the angry populists. That's because we in the pundit class were more familiar with college-educated Republicans. We underestimated how hollow and intellectually spent the Republican establishment had become, and we didn't understand the depth of populist alienation.
In 2020, if you live on the coasts, follow politics intensely and hang around college-educated people, it's easy to think that the disruptive Democratic forces have the upper hand. If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shows up on your Twitter feed every 30 seconds, then you were probably surprised by the giant lead Mr. Biden has established since announcing his candidacy. Seemingly nobody on Twitter supports Mr. Biden.
If you live in these circles, it's worth remembering that a majority of Democrats are over 50. In a recent Gallup survey, a majority of Democrats said the party would be better off moving to the center than to the left.
In short, don't underestimate the Democratic rank and file.
The crucial voters in this primary election could turn out to be African Americans. Right now, Mr. Biden is dominant among these voters. In a field of more than 20 candidates, 50 percent of nonwhite voters support Mr. Biden. Some of these voters like Mr. Biden's longstanding loyalty to the party and its causes; some like his partnership with Mr. Obama; some are members of what you might call the Disillusion Caucus. They believe that given the racism and sexism endemic in American society you've got to nominate a white man if you want your party to win.
If these voters stay where they are, it will be hard for a disrupter to win. So far, white progressives have done a poor job of wooing minority support or even marching in step with minority voters. They talk a lot about social justice but don't support the candidates that minority voters actually support. Highly educated coastal progressives live privileged, affluent lives but define their identity as allies of the oppressed. This privileged pose involves all sorts of psychological contortions that don't resonate with a lot of rank-and-file voters.
It will be interesting to see if any other candidates - Kamala Harris? Cory Booker? - can manage to span these two camps. Pete Buttigieg would seem to be an option, but his support so far is massively from the college-educated. Right now, Mr. Biden is in a strong position - offering progressive policies to a party that is exhausted and doesn't want permanent revolution.

James Comey defends FBI use of 'limited tools' in Trump-Russia investigation

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey fiercely defended the bureau's counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's 2016 campaign after the New York Times reported on Thursday the FBI sent an undercover investigator to meet with a Trump campaign adviser.
During an interview with a Los Angeles radio station, Comey argued the FBI's actions, which have come under fire by GOP investigators concerned about a politically motivated operation to undermine Trump, were restrained and even flawless.
“Really? What would you have the FBI do? We discover in the middle of June of 2016 that the Russians were engaged in a massive effort to mess with this democracy to interfere in the election. We're focused on that and at the end of July we learn that a Trump campaign adviser — two months earlier, before any of this was public — had talked to a Russian representative about the fact that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton and wanted to arrange to share it with the Trump campaign,” Comey told KNX 1070 AM on Friday.
"What should the FBI do when it gets that information? It should investigate to figure out whether any Americans are hooked up with this massive interference effort," he added. "And that's what we did. And as I said earlier, we should have been fired if we didn't. And Republicans ought to breath into a paper bag. There's no way you would do other than what we did, which was use limited tools to try to understand: Is this true? And that's what the investigation was about."
Comey oversaw the FBI when the bureau began its original counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016. It was prompted by Australian diplomat Alexander Downer informing the U.S. government that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told him Russia had stolen emails related to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election.
The Times report revealed that a woman who said her name was Azra Turk posed as an assistant to Stefan Halper, an American professor at Cambridge University and informant for the FBI looking into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Turk asked Papadopoulos point blank if Trump's campaign was working with the Russians at a bar in London in September 2016.
Calling the timing of the Times report "no coincidence," Rep. Mark Meadows, a lead GOP investigator, said the "leaks" show the FBI feels threatened by an investigation by Attorney General William Barr into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. Barr, who recently said "spying did occur" on Trump's presidential team, testified last week that he is "working very closely” with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who has been looking into possible Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse.
[Related: Comey team may have used confidential sources prematurely, ex-FBI intel official says]
The FBI not only used undercover informants to keep tabs on Trump campaign officials with suspicious ties to Russia, but also electronic surveillance.
In February 2018, the House Intelligence Committee, then led by Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., released a memo asserting the so-called Trump dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, was used by the FBI to help obtain a FISA warrant and three renewals to spy on one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. But key information, including its author's anti-Trump bias and Democratic benefactors, was left out. Republicans have often cited the use of the dossier as misinformation used to improperly monitor Trump and his campaign during the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election while Democrats argued in a rebuttal memo that the FISA process was not abused and the Justice Department and FBI "met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement."
GOP outrage over alleged spy abuse extends all the way up to the White House. In a recent interview on Fox News, Trump said Comey, whom he fired from the FBI in May 2017, "probably was one of the people leading the effort on spying" on his 2016 campaign and hinted at a coming document release that would expose the truth.
Comey has vehemently disagreed with the use of the word "spying" to describe the FBI's efforts. "When I hear that kind of language used, it’s concerning because the FBI, the Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance,” Comey said at the Hewlett Foundation's Verify Conference last month. “I have never thought of that as spying.”

The FBI's counterintelligence was wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which recently wrapped up. Mueller said in his report that his team could not establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, but did not make a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined that there was inconclusive evidence to establish an obstruction crime took place, but Democrats argue Mueller left the question open to Congress to investigate and decide.

Sexual assault on flights gets greater scrutiny

Texto completo: Airplanes, with their cramped quarters and crowded conditions, would seem improbable settings for sexual assaults, but recent news accounts show they do happen.
A Detroit-area man who was convicted of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger during an overnight flight was sentenced to nine years in prison, and two men were charged in separate cases in 2018. In August, a female passenger described on Twitter how a man masturbated sitting next to her for hours.
And in March, two flight attendants for JetBlue filed a lawsuit in federal court against the airline and two of its pilots, alleging that the pilots drugged both attendants during a layover and that one of the pilots raped one of the women and a co-worker.
Laura Palumbo, communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said there was every reason to believe that sexual assaults and harassment on flights had started getting increased attention thanks to the #MeToo movement and after a 2016 report that Donald Trump, decades before he became president, sexually assaulted a businesswoman on a flight. (He denied the allegation.)
Reports are poorly tracked Definitive figures about sexual assaults on flights are elusive because no clearinghouse for data exists, the figures that are collected are scattershot, and sexual assaults are the most underreported of violent crimes, experts said.
The FBI tracks only the cases that are reported to it, and the federal Department of Transportation said it forwards such reports to the relevant airline, not to other federal authorities.
Ayn Dietrich-Williams, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Seattle field office, which started an awareness campaign about in-flight sexual assaults, said the number of such assaults reported to the bureau climbed to 63 in the 2017 fiscal year from 38 in the 2014 fiscal year. It dropped to 39 in the 2018 fiscal year.
One-fifth of flight attendants said they had received a report of passenger-on-passenger sexual assault while working on a flight, according to a 2017 survey by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. Law enforcement officials were contacted or met the plane less than half the time, the survey found.
Predators ignore fears of getting caught
Considering the crowded, confined space on a plane, wouldn't an assailant fear being caught?
Kris Macomber, an assistant professor of sociology at Meredith College in Raleigh, North Carolina, said the attacks were an extension of what women have long endured in other public spaces, such as streets, buses and subways. Any fear predators might have about getting caught is overcome by their perceived sense of control.
We also live in an "era of distraction" in which passengers watch movies, listen to music or take sleep medications, making intervention by fellow passengers less likely, Macomber said.
Palumbo said attacks had been known to happen in broad daylight and to passengers in aisle seats where they would be visible to even more potential witnesses.
Authorities offer safety advice
The FBI said offenders would test victims' boundaries by pretending to brush against them to see if they react or wake up. The agency suggested keeping the armrest down between you and your seatmates no matter how friendly they might appear.
Tammy Yard-McCracken, owner of Personal Defense Industries in Virginia and a certified conflict communication instructor, recommended that passengers be mindful about what they divulge to strangers.

Texto completo: PALM BEACH GARDENS — Robert Mueller’s investigators were thorough and professional, says a local attorney who was interviewed for five or six hours by the special counsel’s team last fall and turned over about 500 pages of documents for what turned out to be a bit part in Mueller’s 448-page report.
Jason Fishbein, a 39-year-old BallenIsles resident, did unpaid legal work for WikiLeaks during the 2016
presidential campaign and is mentioned briefly, with no accusation of wrongdoing, in the Mueller report for giving a password to WikiLeaks that WikiLeaks then shared with Donald Trump Jr.
Fishbein’s minor role offers a peek into the way Mueller’s investigators pursued information during their 22-month quest for evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.
Fishbein said two FBI agents who were working for the special counsel’s office came to his door in August 2018. He wasn’t home, but an agent reached him on his cellphone in Colombia, where he had traveled to buy asthma medicine and play poker. He received an electronic copy of a grand jury subpoena seeking records of all his communications with WikiLeaks, the international organization that rocked the 2016 campaign by publishing documents that had been stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
Within weeks, Fishbein said he turned over about 500 pages of material to the special counsel’s office, mainly printouts of his exchanges with WikiLeaks representatives, with whom Fishbein said he communicated almost exclusively through encrypted chat rooms and emails. Fishbein also sat for interviews in Washington in September and November that he said totaled five or six hours combined. He was represented by an attorney whom he declined to name.
“I think they thought I was a bigger player in this drama,” said Fishbein, who described the four or five members of the Mueller team who interviewed him as “very professional, very respectful.”
Investigators asked about his foreign travels, a year he lived in Israel to work on a nonprofit venture, a poker friend with a Russian-sounding name and his work for a West Palm Beach-based intelligence consulting firm, Fishbein said.
Fishbein said he was also asked about Fort Lauderdale resident Roger Stone, the longtime Trump friend and political adviser who was later charged with obstructing a congressional proceeding, making false statements and witness tampering in connection with the Russia investigation. Stone, who has pleaded not guilty, once mentioned Fishbein in an October 2016 email exchange with former Trump campaign chairman Steve Bannon that was first published by The New York Times last November.
Fishbein said he has never met Stone and was baffled by Stone’s reference to him in an email as a “big democrat.” Fishbein is registered to vote in Palm Beach County with no party affiliation, describes his political views as “center-right” and said he has mainly worked for Republican candidates, including former U.S. Reps. Clay Shaw and Allen West.
Fishbein said he volunteered to investigators that he once toured the CIA headquarters lobby and museum as part of a small group with Larry Casey, a longtime Palm Beach County political operative whose uncle, the late William Casey, was CIA director under Ronald Reagan. He also brought up a January 2018 Institute for World Politics dinner at Mar-a-Lago that Fishbein attended as Casey’s guest. Trump made a brief appearance and Fishbein said he shook the president’s hand and exchanged pleasantries.
Investigators asked him a few questions about those topics.
“But mostly they seemed to be focused on WikiLeaks communications, namely whether I had notice of the WikiLeaks releases in 2016,” said Fishbein. He said he never had advance word of the group’s releases. Prosecutors say the documents were stolen by a pair of Russian-front organizations called Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks and passed on to WikiLeaks.
Finding a password
In the end, Fishbein ended up in the Mueller report for an incident that he said investigators barely mentioned when interviewing him.
Page 59 of the Mueller report describes “an individual named Jason Fishbein” giving WikiLeaks the password to a not-yet-launched website that was critical of Trump and his purported Russia ties. Promoters of the PutinTrump.org site in September 2016 invited journalists to send an email to obtain a password to preview the site before its launch. Fishbein said he got the password after it was posted in an internet chat room that included political operatives and writers for conservative publications.
Fishbein said he thought WikiLeaks would find the site interesting because it showed “the Trump-Russia narrative was a political attack. ... Frankly, I didn’t believe it.” He said he sent the password to WikiLeaks via a Twitter direct message.
“What I didn’t know was that they turned around and passed it to Don Jr.,” Fishbein said.
WikiLeaks, according to the Mueller report, contacted Donald Trump Jr. via a Twitter direct message, telling the Republican nominee’s son it had “guessed the password.” The younger Trump, according to the Mueller report, then sent an email to senior campaign staffers telling them he had received “a weird Twitter DM from wikileaks. See below. I tried the password and it works.”
The password allowed users to read the site before it went public, but did not give them access to alter content, Fishbein said.
The fact that WikiLeaks gave Trump Jr. the password was first reported in a November 2017 article by The Atlantic, which did not report how WikiLeaks obtained the password. Fishbein said the article was the first time he heard that WikiLeaks had given the password to Trump Jr., and the first indication that he might be of interest to Mueller’s investigators.
“At that point, I knew I’m somewhat tangentially related to this,” Fishbein said.
Because WikiLeaks told Trump Jr. it had “guessed” the password, his use of it sparked some speculation that prosecutors could charge Trump Jr. with violating the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which forbids accessing a computer without authorization. The law is in Section 1030 of the U.S. criminal code. A heavily redacted portion of the Mueller report is titled “Potential Section 1030 Violation By” with the rest of the title blacked out for reasons of “personal privacy.”
In the Mueller report’s ensuing discussion of the Section 1030 matter, one of the few unredacted portions states: “Applying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, however, the Office determined that prosecution of this potential violation was not warranted. Those Principles instruct prosecutors to consider, among other things, the nature and seriousness of the offense, the person’s culpability in connection with the offense, and the probable sentence to be imposed if the prosecution is successful.”
First involvement
Fishbein said he became interested in WikiLeaks after it released stolen DNC emails in July 2016, creating an uproar that led DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign during the party’s convention in Philadelphia.
“I immediately recognized that this was a gigantic story and so I started researching WikiLeaks and Julian Assange,” said Fishbein. He said he struck up a friendship with Wikileaks attorney Barry Pollack and others and eventually a professional relationship in which he did unpaid legal work, mainly researching international law issues.
Fishbein said he asked one of his WikiLeaks contacts in September 2016 about accusations the group was working with the Russian government. He said he got a strong denial and was told that it would be “discrediting” and a “death sentence” to work with state actors.
Fishbein said he believes WikiLeaks’ denials of a Russian connection, but “it can also be true that they received it, like our intelligence sources tell us, from Russian cutouts. So WikiLeaks was unaware of the real identity of their source but was truthful when they said it was not a Russian state party.”

Texto completo: "Hello guys, I just finished high school," the fresh-faced, bubbly young woman tells the camera. "This year I'm admitted to Stanford."
For more than 90 minutes, she offers a mix of inspiration and advice, mostly in her native Chinese, occasionally breaking into British-inflected English and often rocking closer to the lens as if she's sharing a long talk with a good friend. Excerpts of her video popped up throughout the social media world Friday, identifying her as the daughter of a prominent Chinese family that paid $6.5 million to the mastermind of the national college admissions scandal to get the young woman into Stanford.
Among the advice she shares on how you too can get into an elite American college: "Try hard."
"I'm very lucky I would like to say," the young woman identified as Yusi Zhao says on the video, apparently made a couple of years ago. "I'd like to thank everyone that's helped me and all of that. I just felt like you can always achieve the things that you want to be if you try hard."
Yusi Zhao comments stand in contrast to the younger daughter of actress Lori Loughlin and designer Mossimo Giannulli who have pleaded innocent to charges of paying Singer to slip their girls into USC as phony rowers. Olivia Jade Giannulli in a posted video says she "doesn't really care about school" other than the "partying."
The video surfaced late Thursday with a New York Times story about Yusi Zhao, whose father is Zhao Tao, chairman of Buchang Pharmaceuticals. The company specializes in the development, production and sale of patent medicines and boasts of being among the country's top pharmaceutical enterprises. The company had no immediate response Friday.
According to Forbes, Zhao Tao earned a master's degree in business at Fordham University in New York City and is worth $1.8 billion today. His company specializes in traditional medicine to fight heart disease.
A lawyer representing the young woman's mother, Vincent Law, told the New York Times that the family gave $6.5 million to the college admissions scandal's mastermind, William "Rick" Singer, believing it was a legitimate donation to Stanford. Earlier this week, Stanford said it did not receive a contribution that large tied to Singer. Law, whose office is listed in Shanghai with the state bar association, could not be reached for comment.
The lawyer released a statement from the mother stating that "this generous act was not only done for the good of the school and its students, but also done out of the love and support of Yusi by a caring mother," the New York Times reported.
Stanford has said it expelled one student linked to contributions through Singer after concluding that the student's application contained false information. Citing federal student privacy law, the university would not say whether that student was Zhao, who is not currently listed as a student.
Federal prosecutors in March charged Singer and 49 others, including 33 American parents from coast to coast, in a wide-ranging scheme of taking payments from wealthy families to pay for cheating on entrance exams and bribing college coaches to get their kids into elite universities.
Zhao and her parents have not been charged and are not named in the affidavits and charging documents. The U.S. Attorney's office in Boston, which is prosecuting the case, would not comment on their reported gift and involvement.
Singer, who ran a Newport Beach college admissions consulting firm, has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges and cooperated with investigators in the ongoing investigation. Stanford's head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, also has pleaded guilty, as have coaches from Yale and the University of Texas and a hired test cheater.
Parents charged in the case include two Hollywood actresses and Silicon Valley business executives. Fourteen of the 33 charged parents have pleaded or agreed to plead guilty in agreements to cooperate in the ongoing investigation. No students whose parents are implicated in the case have been charged. Many apparently were unaware of their parents' alleged scheming and payments on their behalf, while others participated in the effort.
Vandemoer worked with Singer to accept payments to his sailing program in exchange for reserving student athlete recruitment slots open for Singer's rich clients.
Stanford has said it received a total of $770,000 in contributions through Singer to its sailing program on behalf of three students. Two were applicants Vandemoer recommended as student sailing recruits who declined to enroll. An additional $500,000 came in on behalf of a third student who had been admitted months earlier, though not as a student sailor, and that the student was expelled after the university found falsified information in the application.
Stanford this week said it was unaware of any $6.5 million payment on behalf of a student and insisted it has not received more than the $770,000 it has said was received through Singer. The university would not say whether some of that money could have come from the reported $6.5 million payment to Singer.
The Zhaos are the second Chinese family said to have given seven-figure payments to Singer far more than his American clients to secure college admission for their children. Another family reportedly paid Singer $1.2 million after their daughter, Sherry Guo, was admitted to Yale. The university rescinded admission for a student connected to Singer whom Yale wouldn't name.
Guo's lawyer told the Los Angeles Times that Singer preyed on foreign families and that, like the Zhaos, her parents believed they were making charitable donations. She and her family haven't been charged.
By contrast, a Hillsborough couple pleaded guilty this week to paying Singer $600,000, much of it in Facebook stock, for his help getting their daughters into USC and UCLA as rowing recruits. Actress Felicity Huffman has agreed to plead guilty to charges of paying $15,000 for test cheating on behalf of a daughter.
The New York Times sent reporters to the Zhao family mansion outside Beijing, where Ferrari, Tesla and Bentley automobiles were parked outside. The Times said the family in a 2015 profile stressed to a Chinese magazine their belief in their children succeeding on their own merits.
"I really look down on those kids who don't rely on their own abilities," Zhao Tao said in the article, according to the Times. In the video said to be his daughter, she implores others to believe they can succeed on their own.
"I just want to encourage everyone and I want everyone to believe in yourself that you can do it," she says. "Everyone, you can do it."

With anti-Semitism on the rise, Jews must call out hatred on the left and the right

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

Texto completo: The ancient hatred has migrated to the internet.
The San Diego synagogue shooter was self-radicalized on a right-wing message board on the website 8chan, posting before he went on his rampage a thank-you to the board’s users: “what I’ve learned here is priceless.”
The attack, which killed one and injured three, came six months to the day after the shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11. The San Diego shooter declared the Pittsburgh shooter — also a creature of fringe internet culture — one of his heroes.
Anti-Semitism is a millennia-old phenomenon, and anti-Jewish shootings in the U.S. aren’t new either (several occurred while George W. Bush and Barack Obama were president).
What’s disturbing about the latest spate of violence is the common thread of white-nationalist ideology, propagated and readily available on the internet and developing its own twisted culture of mass shootings. What happened two decades ago with the Columbine shooting — which set the predicate for years of copycat killers, each soaked in the iconography of Columbine and seeking their own moment of notoriety — is being replicated by a loose collection of sick racists.
The San Diego shooter attested to how quickly he’d been prepped for mass murder by 8chan, where white nationalists push one another to undertake acts of violence that they call “real-life effort-posting.” He said he never could have imagined killing even a few months ago, and that he planned the attack in four weeks.
He explained that he was inspired by the Christchurch mosque shooter, who killed 50 in New Zealand and came from the same white-nationalist 8chan sewer. The San Diego shooter aped his hero by also posting a similar long manifesto to the site and attempting to livestream his crime.
Today’s internet anti-Semitism is based on very old lies, at the bottom of which is the belief that the Jews are an alien, parasitic force conspiring against their host, in this case supposedly the white race. The San Diego shooter even cited a notorious lie dating from the 15th century that Jews had used the blood of a Christian boy to bake their Passover matzos.
The addition the 8chan haters make to the anti-Semitic oeuvre is their very internet in-jokes and memes, underscoring their rancid nihilism.
Because everything must be about Donald Trump, the left blames him for Pittsburgh and San Diego. His critics point to his shabby response to Charlottesville (Trump actually did condemn the white nationalists and neo-Nazis, but posited “fine people” on their side who didn’t exist). Yet Trump was explicitly rejected by the San Diego and Pittsburgh shooters, precisely because he’s so pro-Israel.
His State of the Union address earlier this year was notably philo-Semitic. “We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed,” he said while recognizing a hero of the Pittsburgh massacre. “With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.”
At the same time that an extreme fringe on the right marinates in its own malice, a different sort of anti-Semitism, rooted in hatred for Israel, is getting normalized on the left. It can be seen in the refusal of House Democrats to forthrightly condemn Rep. Ilhan Omar for her anti-Semitic tropes, and in the astonishing publication by the international edition of The New York Times of a political cartoon worthy of Der Sturmer.
It’s not the 1930s again, but the elite atmosphere is becoming more hostile to Israel than it has been for many decades, and the physical threat to Jews is growing. According to news reports, the San Diego shooting might have been much worse if the Poway Chabad congregation hadn’t recently practiced shooter drills, and other synagogues will have to take note. If the freaks on 8chan have anything to say about it, there will be a next time.

IMPEACHING TRUMP WILL ONLY HELP HIM

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly 200 times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Mr. Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Mr. Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mr. Mueller put it, "Unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Mr. Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Mr. Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia - evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mr. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mr. Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Mr. Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mr. Mueller is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff.
Remember, the only reason Mr. Mueller knew about his private exchanges with Mr. McGahn is because Mr. Trump put no restrictions on Mr. McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let Mr. McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mr. Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Mr. Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Mr. Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Mr. Trump's re-election.
First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president.
Second, Mr. Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election.
And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Mr. Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Mr. Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Mr. Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Mr. Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Mr. Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: Two Detroit journalists — current and former Free Press reporters — have been selected to be part of a prestigious journalism fellowship program at Harvard University next fall to study and research topics on significant public policy issues.
The Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard has selected 27 Nieman Fellows for the class of 2020. The group includes local reporters, foreign correspondents, editors, a photographer, a bureau chief, television producers, newsroom executives and others who specialize in data investigations, digital development and innovative forms of reporting across all platforms. They will begin two semesters of study at Harvard University in the fall.
Matthew Dolan, an investigative reporter at the Free Press, will study automation and the future of transportation. For his field work as an Abrams Nieman Fellow, he will investigate how increasing technological disruption in the nation's auto industry impacts local communities.
As an investigative reporter at the Free Press, Dolan focuses on business, finance and the intersection with public policy and government. Along with higher education reporter David Jesse, he spearheaded what is believed to be a first of its kind examination of a major university endowment, detailing how executives at some of the nation's top investment firms donated hundreds of millions of dollars to the University of Michigan while the university in turn invested as much as $4 billion in those companies' funds.
Prior to September 2015, he worked for nearly eight years at the Wall Street Journal's Detroit bureau, first as an automotive industry reporter and then as a reporter on the paper's national desk. He previously worked as a reporter at the Baltimore Sun, Virginian-Pilot and Philadelphia Inquirer.
He is a graduate of Cornell University and the University of Michigan-Dearborn. He has received several local, state and national awards for his reporting. During his career, he has reported stories from around the country and the world, including Cuba, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Iraq (three trips as an embedded reporter with the U.S. military), Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Vietnam, South Korea among others. He has been awarded several journalism fellowships include those from the Poynter Institute, the Knight Foundation and the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii.
Dolan is part of only the second group of journalists chosen as Abrams Nieman Fellows for Local Investigative Journalism. After two semesters at Harvard, he will work on a public service reporting project and participate in specialized journalism education. The fellowships are funded by a grant from the Abrams Foundation designed to strengthen local news coverage in underserved communities across the United States.
Chastity Pratt, the urban affairs reporter in the Detroit bureau of Bridge Magazine, will study how government has destabilized urban education and the ways multimedia storytelling can amplify solutions. Pratt, who previously covered Detroit Public Schools at the Free Press, covers Michigan cities and urban affairs for Bridge.
She joined Bridge after more than a decade of covering education at the Free Press. Pratt's work also has appeared in USA TODAY, Essence Magazine and the Investigative Reporters & Editors Journal.
Before the Free Press, the Detroit native was a reporter at Newsday in Long Island, New York, and The Oregonian newspaper in Portland. She started her career as an intern at The New York Times. She holds a bachelor's degree in English and communications from the University of Michigan.

Texto completo: Headnote TRUMP RUSSIA PROBE
WASHINGTON - House Democrats' feud with Attorney General William Barr boiled over Thursday, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused the nation's top law enforcement official of lying to lawmakers and the Judiciary Committee threatened to hold him in contempt of Congress if he did not relent and promptly hand over a complete version of Robert Mueller's report and evidence.
The escalation between the two branches of government, a day after Barr mounted an aggressive defense of himself in the Senate, was as abrupt and emotionally charged as any in decades. It left Democrats seeking to investigate President Donald Trump and his associates in an even more difficult position as they try to convince the Trump administration to hand over material they say they need to hold the president to account.
Tensions were already running high before Pelosi's remarks. The Justice Department declined Wednesday to provide the materials the Judiciary Committee had demanded under subpoena and Thursday morning Barr himself failed to appear at another hearing on Mueller's findings because of a dispute over who would be allowed to ask him questions.
But it was a newly revealed letter from Mueller to the attorney general in which he took Barr to task for the way he had initially summarized his findings that most provoked Pelosi's ire. The communication appeared to undercut Barr's claims at an April 9 House hearing that he was not aware of any such discontent.
"What is deadly serious about it is the attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States," Pelosi told reporters. "That's a crime."
The Justice Department and Republicans on Capitol Hill fired back at the speaker. Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman, called Pelosi's comments a "baseless attack" as well as "reckless, irresponsible and false."
The calls for Barr to be held in contempt of Congress stem not from Mueller's letter but from the Justice Department's decision not to honor the Judiciary Committee's subpoena to see Mueller's report without redactions and all the evidence his investigators collected. In a letter to lawmakers, the department said that sharing the information would put the integrity of its investigations at risk, but Democrats were not ready to accept that answer.
Convening in a nearly empty hearing room despite his absence, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called on Republicans to join Democrats in standing up for the rights of Congress against an administration that he said was systematically thwarting its constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch.
But mostly he trained his ire at the attorney general, who objected to Nadler's insistence that staff lawyers be allowed to ask questions at the hearing.
"We will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith," he said. "But the attorney general must make a choice. Every one of us must make the same choice. That choice is now an obligation of our office. The choice is simple: we can stand up to this President in defense of the country and the Constitution we love, or we can let the moment pass us by."
The practical challenge for Nadler and other House committee leaders is figuring out how to secure the material they need for their work from an administration they continue to malign. Nadler said that he would give Barr "one or two more days" to relent on producing the full Mueller report and the evidence gathered to compile it before initiating contempt proceedings. Committee Democrats were preparing to make the Justice Department a formal counteroffer and still hoped to stave off a formal escalation of hostilities.
But with no cooperation in sight, House Democrats could soon have to choose from a handful of paths to escalate pressure.
Some lawmakers are arguing for opening an impeachment inquiry of Trump, which grants the House clearer powers to command information from the executive branch, including secretive grand jury material.
In a private meeting with members of her leadership team, Pelosi was no gentler than she had been in public. She called Barr a "lap dog" for Trump and an "enabler" of his obstruction of justice, according to a congressional aide in the room.
But she also continued to hold her line against impeachment.
"Impeachment is too good for him," she said of Trump, according to the aide.
A contempt proceeding, though not necessarily punitive, would put a mark on Barr's record and could push the dispute into the courts. House Republicans chose that route in 2012 when they held Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over internal Justice Department documents. Democrats could begin the proceedings as soon as next week if they cannot budge Barr.
Democrats have also still been unable to secure testimony from Mueller himself. Nadler said Wednesday that they were hoping to hold a hearing May 15, but were still "seeking to firm up the date" with the Justice Department. It is also unclear if Don McGahn, the former White House counsel whom the committee subpoenaed to testify this month, will show up.
Democrats are not the only ones unhappy with how the nearly two-year special counsel investigation is coming to a close. In a letter dated April 19 but released on Thursday, a top White House lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, complained to Barr that the special counsel had violated the regulations governing his appointment by failing to reach a prosecutorial decision on obstruction of justice and handing over a 182-page discussion of evidence he called "part 'truth commission' report part law school exam paper."
He cautioned the attorney general that despite choosing not to exert executive privilege over material contained in the report, the president maintained the right to conceal raw evidence collected by the special counsel and to block witnesses from appearing before Congress.
In the Judiciary hearing room Thursday, where the committee convened for only about 10 minutes, there were some moments of levity, too. Before the hearing even began, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., munched on Kentucky Fried Chicken on the dais as press cameras clicked.
"Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions," Cohen told reporters a short time later. "An attorney general's who's picked for his legal acumen and his abilities would not be fearful of attorneys questioning him for 30 minutes. This man was picked to be Roy Cohn and to be Donald Trump's fixer."
Officially, Barr refused to show for the Judiciary Committee hearing because Democrats had insisted that he sit for questioning from Democratic and Republican staff lawyers. In a statement Wednesday, Kupec called Democrats' demands "unprecedented and unnecessary." She said Barr would be happy to come testify if Democrats would drop that demand.
That did not appear likely, as Democrats continued to insist it was their prerogative to decide how to run their hearings. Seeking to dramatize the attorney general's absence, they set out an empty chair with a name card for Barr.
"The so-called attorney general is abrasive, evasive and unpersuasive," said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 House Democrat and a member of the Judiciary Committee. "He is a disgrace to the office that he currently holds. The so-called attorney general is missing in action, absent without official leave."
Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the committee, lit into his Democratic colleagues for making "ludicrous" demands of the attorney general, and accused the committee's chairman of manufacturing a conflict instead of trying to get at the truth.
"The reason Bill Barr is not here today is because the Democrats decided they did not want him here today," Collins said, his rapid-fire Georgia rat-a-tat winding up in indignation.
When Republicans tried to prolong the brief session with parliamentary objections, Nadler gaveled out, cut the microphones and walked out of the hearing room.
It was a stark contrast to just a day before, when Barr testified for five hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a hearing largely spent defending his handling of the special counsel's report.
Democrats pressed Barr on the newly revealed letter from Mueller. They asked him to explain why he did not view specific actions by Trump to thwart investigators as obstruction of justice. And they excoriated Barr as "purposely misleading" Congress and the public and even lying to Congress, all in service of insulating Trump from the consequences of his actions.
Barr did not give ground, agreeing with Republicans that the time had come to review the conduct of investigators and move on.

Texto completo: Venezuela's president sought to strengthen his image as the undisputed commander of the armed forces Thursday, mustering troops in a televised show of authority days after the opposition tried to incite a military mutiny that fizzled within hours.
President Nicolas Maduro was dressed in green fatigues and a cap as he waved and spoke to soldiers at a military base in Caracas, the capital. The event seemed intended to further contradict assertions by Juan Guaid�, the opposition leader, that the armed forces were switching their allegiance to him as the economy lurches toward collapse.
"Soldiers of the fatherland, it's time to fight!" Maduro said to hundreds of soldiers at the Fuerte Tiuna base.
Guaid�, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president more than three months ago, asserting that Maduro was a corrupt, illegitimate and incompetent autocrat who had stifled dissent and remained in power through an election widely believed to be fraudulent.
Guaid� has the support of more than 50 countries, but has been unable to turn military commanders to his side - and their support is crucial to turning the tide against Maduro.
On Tuesday, he sought to re-energize his flagging effort to push Maduro out, orchestrating an appearance with Leopoldo L�pez, a respected leader of the opposition who had apparently been allowed to walk free by officers who kept him in house arrest, and by some mutinous National Guard members.
The event surprised the country and raised speculation of a broader military uprising afoot against Maduro.
But hours later it was over, as top military commanders reasserted their fealty to him. Maduro and his aides described the event as a U.S.-backed coup attempt and a prelude to a possible invasion instigated by Trump administration officials.
'How many would die if there is a civil war here because of their insanity?" Maduro said in his remarks to the troops Thursday. "How many years would we resist?"
At least 20 National Guard members who participated in the coup attempt sought asylum in the Brazilian Embassy in Caracas, and Lopez sought protection with Spain's ambassador to Venezuela.
But there has been no overt effort to arrest Guaid�, a reflection of the schisms in Venezuelan society over the political struggle convulsing the country.
Guaid� not only has the backing of the Trump administration but also of Latin American neighbors, including Brazil and Colombia, and most European countries. Maduro is backed by longtime allies such as Cuba and Russia.
The Trump administration, which clearly had advance notice of Guaid�'s effort Tuesday, declared that several top aides of Maduro had been plotting against him and that there was a plan to take power.
One of those aides, according to top U.S. officials, was the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino. But Padrino was seen side by side with Maduro in his televised appearance Thursday, asking the troops to stay loyal and united.
"I'm outraged that they pretend to buy me with tricky offers," Padrino said.
"They pretend to buy us."

Texto completo: Ruth Reichl couldn't say no. When asked by Table to Table, the non-profit organization that helps feed the hungry in North Jersey, to be the honorary guest at its annual fundraising gala, Reichl, the last editor-in-chief of storied Gourmet magazine before it ceased publication, and the author of a new memoir, said : "Yes, of course."
The gala is scheduled for May 9 at the Edgewood Country Club in River Vale, where top-notch chefs will prepare a multi-course dinner. Among them are David Burke, executive culinary director of recently opened Ventanas in Fort Lee, and Ben Pollinger, chef/owner of The Hill in Closter.
Reichl was Gourmet's top editor for a decade, from 1999 until 2009 when Condé Nast announced it was shuttering the magazine. The news was not only a shock to the 70-year-old magazine's many fans, but Reichl herself.
"I have a hard time understanding why Condé Nast gave up on a magazine that had such an amazing connection with its readers," she said.
We caught up with Reichl, who is on a book tour for her Gourmet memoir, "Save Me the Plums," to ask about Conde Nast's famously lavish perks, what she looks for in restaurants and why Americans are finally obsessed with food.
What was the hardest part of being the editor of Gourmet magazine? Ruth Reichl: I was a newspaper writer. Most of the time, I sat at my computer by myself. Learning how magazines worked was huge. People at the magazine spoke a different language. I thought TOC was one word. I had to learn it stood for "Table of Contents."
Did you know what you wanted to do with the magazine? RR: Oh yes. Gourmet's motto used to be 'timeless.' I said, this is no time to be timeless. There's so much changing and happening in the world of food. I thought the magazine was stodgy. It needed to get a new generation of younger writers, literary writers. It needed to write about vacations, not just resorts and cruises. The magazine needed to give people useful advice, not just dreamy long recipes but also recipes for quick meals during the week. And the magazine needed to address important issues like genetic modification.
Condé Nast was famous for its amazing perks. What was that like for you? RR: It was as if my pumpkin turned into a carriage. I had a chauffeur. I had someone do my hair, my makeup. I had a wardrobe allowance. I knew it wouldn't last. I don't miss it. All that stuff was nonsense. What I miss is the joy of putting a magazine together with that group of people.
Do you think Americans are obsessed with food? RR: I don't. We Americans were oblivious to food, which is not normal. Cooking is the most basic human activity. We cook, animals don't. Most cultures are obsessed with food. We're making up for it now.
What changed? RR: Food TV. But I don't watch it. I spend enough of my real time with food.
What do you look for in a restaurant? RR: It depends what restaurant. People go to restaurants for different reasons. People go out for so much more than food. I love the restaurants that are virtually theater, like 11 Madison Park. Where the food is a surprise; you're entertained. Where the entire evening you wait for fireworks. I wouldn't want it all the time, but when you go to a three-star restaurant, what you want is the fantasy of being a wealthy person. You don't just want great food. You want to feel pampered, as if you were a Rockefeller. Other times you want to understand the culture of a different culture. You want to know what the food of, say, Karala tastes like.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump attacked the media on Friday after being asked about World Press Freedom Day and how he could mend relations between his administration and the Fourth Estate.
Speaking from the Oval Office with Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, Trump talked Slovakia, an hour-long phone call he'd had with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the media.
Asked about Friday being World Press Freedom Day, the president said, "I think I have a very good relationship with some of the press. "
"Unfortunately," Trump added, "some of the press does not cover me accurately and in fact, they go out of their way to cover me inaccurately, so I don't think that's a free press. I think that's a dishonest press. "
He applauded the New York Times, which like other news organizations, he typically attacks as "fake news" and an "enemy of the people," for a story about the FBI and an undercover investigator that met with one of his campaign aides during the 2016 White House race.
In light of World Press Freedom Day, journalists across the globe honored colleagues who have died doing their jobs or been jailed because of their work.
Many highlighted the work of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed by a team of Saudi operatives last fall, and Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were imprisoned in Myanmar following an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in a village in Rakhine state.
Last year, 54 journalists were killed across the globe, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. That number includes the reporters killed in June at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Md. Five employees of the paper were shot and killed, including four journalists and a sales assistant.
The Committee also notes that as of December, more than 250 journalists remained imprisoned around the world.
Trump, while talking with reporters Friday, also discussed his phone call with Putin, explaining the two leaders discussing the ongoing situation in Venezuela and the results of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Trump said that Putin called the investigation "a mountain" that "ended up being a mouse. "

NYT ran a devastating piece on Biden's self-dealing in Ukraine. So why is the headline about Trump?

Texto completo: If New York Times reporters Ken Vogel and Iuliia Mendel have not already had an angry conversation with their editors about the headline used to promote their report detailing legitimate questions about the Biden family’s possible conflicts of interest, they should.
Vogel and Mendel’s deeply sourced, well-reported story works through the complicated details of former Vice President Joe Biden’s successful efforts in 2016 to oust one of Ukraine’s top prosecutors, and how it may have benefited the 2020 presidential candidate’s son, Hunter.
"[Joe Biden's] pressure campaign worked," write Vogel and Mendel. "The prosecutor general, long a target of criticism from other Western nations and international lenders, was soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament."
They add, "Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden’s younger son, who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general."
And this is how the Times headlined the 2,500-plus-word report: “Biden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions That Are Being Promoted by Trump and Allies.”
Fun fact: In journalism, nine out 10 times the headline is picked by editors, not the journalists.
All that work and effort reporting on fair questions about whether the son of a Democratic presidential candidate profited from his father’s involvement in U.S. foreign policy activities, and the Times' editors kneecap the story from the get-go with a headline insinuating that this is just a bunch Trump-world nonsense.
To be clear, the Times report does dedicate time and energy to detailing the efforts by President Trump and his allies to shine a light on the personal and public activities of the Biden family.
The report reads:
But the renewed scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s experience in Ukraine has also been fanned by allies of Mr. Trump. They have been eager to publicize and even encourage the investigation, as well as other Ukrainian inquiries that serve Mr. Trump’s political ends, underscoring the Trump campaign’s concern about the electoral threat from the former vice president’s presidential campaign. The Trump team’s efforts to draw attention to the Bidens’ work in Ukraine, which is already yielding coverage in conservative media, has been led partly by Rudolph W. Giuliani, who served as a lawyer for Mr. Trump in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Giuliani’s involvement raises questions about whether Mr. Trump is endorsing an effort to push a foreign government to proceed with a case that could hurt a political opponent at home.
Giuliani is quoted in the report as saying that the Biden questions cropped up during a larger investigation into whether Ukrainian activists helped jump-start the special counsel’s since-shuttered two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
“I can assure you this all started with an allegation about possible Ukrainian involvement in the investigation of Russian meddling, and not Biden,” Giuliani said. “The Biden piece is collateral to the bigger story, but must still be investigated, but without the prejudgments that infected the collusion story.”
But the Trump stuff is only a part of the reporters’ much deeper dive into the financial and foreign policy activities of the Bidens.
There are legitimate questions about whether the former vice president’s family benefited financially from his years in the White House, and the Times reporters do an excellent job exploring these questions. The headline picked by the Times editors, however, fails entirely to convey the legitimacy of these questions to the reader.
Instead, it is suggested right off the bat that inquiries about whether the Bidens have profited from an unethical overlap of public and private activities are just more crazy stuff promoted by Trump's allies. That is a disservice to readers and to the reporters who put the story together.

Punting on Senate sets Stacey Abrams up for bigger things — and avoids 'two time loser' badge

Texto completo: Stacey Abrams cited lack of interest in the job of being a senator when she announced Monday that she would not challenge vulnerable Sen. David Perdue, D-Ga., in 2020. But the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate has not been shy about her political ambitions, and analysts suspect that she ruled out a Senate run so she can position herself for something better rather than risking another statewide loss.
The former Georgia state representative shot to stardom after narrowly losing her 2018 bid for governor to Republican Brian Kemp. She delivered the Democratic response to President Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address in February and has gone to work building a network of Democratic support, even meeting with former Vice President Joe Biden in March.
After Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tried to convince Abrams to run for Senate in 2020, she took her time in announcing whether she would challenge Purdue — first saying that she would decide by the end of March, then the end of April. On the last day of the month, Abrams revealed her decision.
"The fights to be waged require a deep commitment to the job, and I do not see the U.S. Senate as the best role for me in this battle for the nation's future,” she said in a video posted to Twitter.
Atlanta-based Republican strategist Jullianne Thompson told the Washington Examiner that she thought Abrams “saw the writing on the wall” that Perdue would be reelected in 2020, noting his popularity in the state.
A Morning Consult poll from the first quarter of 2019 found that Perdue had a 47% approval and 25% disapproval in Georgia — a higher approval rating than most other sitting senators and senators considered vulnerable in 2020. Still, the race is expected to be tough for Perdue.
“Abrams came out of that [2018 gubernatorial] loss looking good among Democrats, but I think she realizes that a second loss would jeopardize her career, and she didn’t seem keen to risk it in order to run for a job she didn’t seem to covet," Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told the Washington Examiner. "She can bide her time until the next opportunity comes along."
A source familiar with Abrams' thinking disputed the notion that she thought she would lose to Perdue in 2020.
[Opinion: Rising Democratic star Stacey Abrams, still the sorest loser in American politics]
"She could have defeated David Perdue, as can another Democrat. In 2018, she came closer than any Democrat in a generation to winning at the top of the ticket," the source said.
Abrams still has plenty of options. She has not ruled out jumping into the crowded Democratic presidential field, joining the eventual Democratic presidential nominee as the vice presidential candidate on the ticket, or running for governor again in 2022.
The longer Abrams delays announcing a 2020 decision, the longer she stays in the national conversation — a point she acknowledged in a New York Times Magazine interview published Monday.
“It was important to me to not dismiss the calls for me to think about running, especially based on my race and gender and region, because the way I was being dismissed was largely driven by my profile,” Abrams said.
Georgia Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson told the Washington Examiner that he would be surprised of Abrams announces a 2020 presidential bid, “not because she wouldn’t be competitive or eminently qualified, but because she knows her time is more valuable than spending a year in a knock-down, drag-out primary away from her home state.”
Another Democratic strategist in Georgia, Howard Franklin, said he believes Abrams is “gearing up for another run at governor in 2022.”
Abrams could also take a job in a Democratic presidential administration should Trump lose in 2020. In the meantime, she says she will focus her attention on combating voter suppression in Georgia and around the country.
“I don't expect Tuesday's announcement will diminish the amount of attention she receives or her enthusiasm for electing Democrats up and down the ticket," Franklin said.

Texto completo: Speakers at three central Maine commencements run the gamut from retired U.S. Army sergeant to Pulitzer Prize-winning author.

The director of operations for a project management company in the nuclear industry, a retired U.S. Army sergeant and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author will speak at graduations at three central Maine institutes of higher learning next month.
Elizabeth Strout, winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her book “Olive Kitteridge,” will speak at the University of Maine at Farmington’s graduation on Saturday, May 11, at 10:30 a.m., the university announced Monday.
“Elizabeth Strout’s extraordinary career has its roots in a deeply abiding sense of Maine’s unique spirit,” said Eric Brown, UMF interim president, in a news release.
“Her writing is authentic, unabashed in its rendering of the full range of human experience, from the troubled to the triumphant, and a wonderful example of the power of story in shaping life’s meaning. We are thrilled to have her address our 2019 graduating class.”
Strout was born in Portland and raised in small towns in Maine and New Hampshire, according to the release.
She is also the author of “Anything Is Possible,” her most recent book and winner of The Story Prize; “The Burgess Boys,” named one of the best books of the year by The Washington Post and NPR; “Abide with Me,” a national bestseller; and “Amy and Isabelle,” winner of the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize.
UMF’s graduation will take place at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, May 11, behind the Olsen Student Center and is open to the public.
At Thomas College, Todd Smith, president of TSSD Services, an Oakland-based project management company specializing in the nuclear industry, will be the commencement speaker.
Smith, who graduated from Thomas with a B.S. in Accounting in 1992 and an M.B.A. degree in 1999, has been a Thomas College Board of Trustee member since 2004, and became co-chair of the board in 2010.
According to the college, his leadership and philanthropy helped lead to program and scholarship expansion and facility expansion including the construction of the Harold Alfond Academic Center, the Kennebec Savings Turf Field Complex and the Henry and Ellen Hinman Residence Hall.
The ceremony will take place Saturday, May 11, at 1 p.m. in the Alfond Athletic Center at Thomas.
Retired United States Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills will deliver the commencement speech at Unity College.
In April 2012, Mills was critically injured on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan by an IED while on patrol, losing portions of both legs and both arms.
He is one of only five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to survive his injuries.
He has since started the Travis Mills Foundation, and has a New York Times bestselling memoir, “Tough as They Come.”
The ceremony will be held Saturday, May 11, starting at 11 a.m. in Tozier Gymnasium.
Colby College’s commencement is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Sunday, May 26, on the Miller Library Lawn. A speaker has not yet been announced.

Texto completo: Yom HaShoah, when Jews worldwide remember the millions martyred in the Holocaust, is the time to assess what lessons humanity has learned - and hasn't - from the monumental crime perpetrated by Germany.
Nazis marched through Charlottesville; Hate crimes against Jews are rising in frequency and lethality; a member of Congress has repeatedly spouted anti-Semitic insults without direct rebuke from her colleagues; an anti-Semitic cartoon disgracefully leached into the pages of the international edition of The New York Times.
We don't suggest another Kristallnacht is near. But the surest way to guard against further slippage, and mass hate crimes against other groups, is education, in the classroom and courtroom.
Next week, the largest exhibition of Auschwitz artifacts ever in this country will open at downtown's Museum of Jewish Heritage. On loan from the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum are more than 1,000 objects and photographs, from concrete fence posts to a barracks to a cattle car used to deport Jews to their deaths, documenting what the Germans left behind. And what the Jews left behind: suitcases, eyeglasses and shoes of the murdered.
Accountability continues, with Germany bringing new charges against a concentration camp guard. The expulsion of a death camp guard from Queens to Germany served justice. And the Canadian government is close to expelling a death squad member.
Never forget. Never relent.

Texto completo: The team of lawyers named by Gov. Phil Murphy to investigate New Jersey's controversial tax breaks will follow up its bombshell inaugural meeting, where a whistle-blower said her former company lied to win incentives, with more interviews Thursday.
The task force said it plans to interview "several" witnesses in its mission to determine if tax breaks were properly awarded and whether the agency that administers them, the Economic Development Authority, "applied appropriate scrutiny" to incentive applications.
Those key questions have come to the forefront of debate in Trenton since the task force met for the first time in March. A pair of reports Wednesday raised more questions about the integrity of the incentive programs used heavily under Republican former Gov. Chris Christie and passed by Democrats in the Legislature.
The New York Times found that a lawyer with deep connections to Democratic politicians had a hand in writing the tax incentive legislation, the Economic Opportunity Act. That lawyer, Kevin Sheehan, helped edit portions of the bill that opened "sizable" tax breaks to clients of his law firm, Parker McCay.
Earlier Wednesday, a joint WNYC and ProPublica investigation found that two-thirds of the tax break awards in Camden, or more than $1 billion, went to companies connected to George Norcross, the powerful unelected Democrat who is allies with Senate President Stephen Sweeney, and business partners and clients of his brother's law firm.
One of Norcross' two brothers, Phil Norcross, is chief executive officer of Parker McCay. Phil Norcross told the Wall Street Journal in an earlier interview that he helped write amendments to the tax break bill. Another brother, Donald Norcross, was a union leader who served in the state Legislature and co-sponsored the bill. He is now a U.S. Representative.
Murphy said he was "deeply troubled" by the findings of the two reports.
"Coupled with what we already know about how the tax incentive program operated over the past six years, I believe now more than ever in the importance of the task force I commissioned," Murphy said in a statement. "Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for. If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable."
Norcross issued a lengthy statement Wednesday responding to the WNYC report and even thanked the news outlet for "its lengthy story detailing the massive undertaking to help rebuild Camden's future."
"The fact that private investment is returning to Camden is no accident — it was planned and fought for. As WNYC and other media outlets have reported, the commitment to rebuilding Camden's future began years ago and focused on the city's three biggest challenges: improving public safety, reforming education and bringing jobs and economic investment to the city," Norcross said.
While the Murphy task force and a legislative committee looking into the incentive programs continue their work, Murphy has tried to assert his influence in the debate. He sought the resignation of certain authority board members, but most of them defied him and remain in positions to grant future awards. And Murphy's Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, accused the Democrat of engaging in "political assassination" to gain support for his own incentives.
It does not appear that Murphy plans to apply pressure on the holdout board members, who were named to their seats by Christie.
"They're the government appointees. We approached them, we laid out our case, they made their decision. We have to respect that decision. We don't agree with them," Murphy said last week.
Days later he named Kevin Quinn, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where Murphy worked for two decades, the authority's next board chairman. He replaces Laurence Downes, the only person who stepped down at Murphy's request.
The members of the task force are expected to hear from current and former executives of the authority when they meet Thursday in Newark. The witnesses have been subpoenaed by the task force, according to an announcement of the meeting.
Since it is armed with subpoena authority and includes white-collar crime lawyers, the task force poses perhaps the greatest threat to those who may have abused the tax incentives. At its first meeting, a woman testified that her former company lied to win tax breaks.
The panel has also said it has "obtained robust cooperation" from companies who received tax breaks, including one that admitted it was out of compliance and agreed to repay its grant, saving taxpayers $1.5 million. It has also made a criminal referral and said it has uncovered evidence of unregistered lobbying on behalf of special interests.
"As we have said, we are going to follow the facts in a search for the truth," said Ronald Chen, chairman of the task force. "Whether that means recertifying companies, seeking voluntary payments and terminations, or making referrals, we plan to be thorough, objective and efficient."
In the meantime, a group of activists signaled legal trouble for the authority by having its lawyer send a letter requesting that it preserve all documents related to tax incentives from 2010 on. Such letters typically precede a lawsuit.
Sue Altman, a board member of South Jersey Women for Progressive Change, which is one of many groups represented by the law firm Weissman & Mintz, said Tuesday that the potential lawsuit is partly an attempt to obtain documents from the authority and to convince authority board members to leave.

Texto completo: East Bay Rep. Eric Swalwell earned his place on the Democratic presidential debate stage Tuesday after getting 1 percent in his third qualifying poll since becoming a White House candidate.
Tuesday's CNN poll found him at 1 percent nationally following polls earlier this month that put him at 1 percent in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The Democratic rules require candidates to qualify either by getting donations from at least 65,000 individual people, or getting at least 1 percent in three polls from approved polling organizations nationally or in one of the first primary states.
The CNN poll found former Vice President Joe Biden leading the field with 39 percent of respondents saying they would vote for him, and getting a bump after he officially announced his long-expected presidential bid last week. California Sen. Kamala Harris was in sixth place with 5 percent among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters.
While the poll results reinforce what a long shot Swalwell is for the presidency, the debate will give him an opportunity to make his case for gun control and student debt reform in front of what could be one of his largest audiences yet.
But the stage will be packed, and the 38-year-old representative will be under pressure to produce a breakout moment. He's the 17th candidate to qualify for the event, which will take place in Miami on June 26 and 27 with the candidates randomly split up between each night.
And there's still a chance Swalwell could eventually be shunted out of the debate. If more than 20 candidates qualify for the debates through either the donor or polling thresholds, they'll be winnowed down based on those who meet both measures. There are currently 20 Democrats running for president, with several other politicians eyeing a bid.
Swalwell hasn't yet received donations from 65,000 people, although his campaign said he was making progress toward that goal. A New York Times analysis this week found that only eight candidates had qualified through both methods so far, including Harris. (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii became the ninth after CNN's latest poll.)
"I'm grateful that I'll have a place on the debate stage to discuss ending gun violence, providing affordable healthcare for all while finding cures in our lifetime, ensuring all communities have top-notch schools, and making sure student loan debt isn't a lifetime burden," Swalwell said in a statement.
Since he entered the presidential race with an announcement on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert earlier this month, Swalwell has campaigned across the early states, near the site of the Parkland, Florida school shooting, and in his hometown of Dublin, Calif. He met Democrats at house parties and forums across Iowa this weekend, focusing on rural towns. He's also kept up a steady stream of appearances on cable TV.

Cupp: What Uncle Joe can learn from Mayor Pete

Texto completo: So far, he's hitting it out of the park.
Less than one week after Joe Biden announced he's running for president — again — he's in an enviable spot. He smashed all 2020 subsequent one-day fundraising records, bringing in a whopping $6.3 million on his first day. A new CNN poll of Democratic candidates shows Biden with a sizable lead at 39 percent, with Bernie Sanders second at 15 percent. A Quinnipiac survey has a similar margin with Biden at 38 percent, with Elizabeth Warren in second at 12 percent (with Sanders third at 11 percent).
And his strategy to start his campaign by reminding Americans what President Donald Trump said after the Nazi protests in Charlottesville left one woman dead was met, by all accounts, with its intended reaction. Biden drew Trump into the debate he wants to have — about moral character — and Trump responded with a flurry of reflexive tweets. In the words of New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, "What (Trump's) doing is elevating Joe Biden and basically turning this into a one-on-one between himself and Joe Biden 18 months ahead of time."
Of course, Biden still faces plenty of challenges: a far-left wing of his party that dismisses him as insufficiently progressive, decidedly old guard and a vestige of pre-partisan politics. (How dare he, for example, pay Vice President Mike Pence a compliment?)
Finally, there's Mayor Pete. Until Biden jumped in, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was convincingly occupying the lane Biden was meant to dominate — moderate Democrats. Buttigieg's enormously effective charm offensive catapulted him to the top of the field. As different as they are in terms of background and resume, Biden and Buttigieg are now facing off for many of the same voters.
Biden could learn something important from the rookie. One of the ways Buttigieg has managed to break through a crowded field has been his stunning accessibility. As Politico recently pointed out, he's made himself available to anyone from Indianapolis Monthly to radio host Charlamagne tha God, an environmental newsletter with 5,000 Twitter followers to a podcast about "The West Wing," Bill Maher to Barstool Sports.
With decades in politics and nearly 100 percent name ID, it would be intuitive to think Biden didn't really need to take this approach. Where Mayor Pete needs to introduce himself to America, Uncle Joe is already a well-known member of the family.
But this is exactly Biden's problem — his record is long and our views of him are cemented.
They don't have to be. If he wants to win the Democratic Party nomination Biden needs to be like Buttigieg — everywhere. Not just the predictable platforms like "The View," where he announced his candidacy, or "Good Morning America," where he responded to some of his critics in a taped piece that aired this week.
Instead of the pre-packaged version of himself he wants us to see in slick, produced videos and well-scripted statements, surrounded by friendly interviewers with big reach, he should go to the podcasts, digital series, and off-beat outlets. He should introduce himself to millennials and reintroduce himself to Gen Xers and even boomers. And yes, he should go on Fox News. Nowhere should be too obscure or "not worth the effort."
Anything less and Biden will look entitled, out of touch and, frankly, too tired for the job.
At 76 and with nearly half a century in politics, he'll never be the new kid on the block. But the trick for Joe Biden now is to pretend he is. And that means giving us a Biden we've never seen before.

Texto completo: Demand better of media Well, the Mueller report is completed and The Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press, Daily Herald and all Democrats are upset because the findings do not match the incorrect stories they have been publishing for the past almost three years. Now they are scrambling to cherry-pick bits, pieces and phrases from the report in an attempt to justify their false reporting.
The fact is that the report found 25 Russians and three companies were charged with trying to interfere with the 2016 presidential election without the assistance of any Americans. They also found that the Obama administration was aware of this back then but failed to do anything about it.
Perhaps this should have been reported as big news back then as well as now. Perhaps the headline on the Daily Herald Opinion page should be "We must do better" rather than "We must demand better." Our citizens need to demand better of the media.
Daryl G. Pratt Arlington Heights Disney’s executive compensation outrage Kudos to Abigail Disney for making herself heard regarding the compensation paid to Disney CEO Bob Iger.
When the new tax plan was passed giving big business huge tax breaks, it was supposed to enable corporations to raise the salaries of everyone working for them. Instead, some companies gave one-time bonuses, others gave small salary increases to those who kept the business running every day and used the money to provide more dividends for stockholders. When a CEO is paid over 1,000 times as much as the average employee, there is something wrong with our system.
How many millions does one person need to make to feed his ego, while employees struggle to hold their families together? Minimum wage is a farce. It’s time we took a good look at employee compensation, including company medical coverage.
Thank you, Ms. Disney, for having the courage to step forward on this issue. I think your grandfather would be proud.

Texto completo: Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, which the couple launched last year, has partnered with Netflix for a slate of projects that include scripted and unscripted shows as well as full-length features and documentaries.
"We created Higher Ground to harness the power of storytelling," the former president said. "Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more, we believe each of these productions won't just entertain, but will educate, connect and inspire us all."
Some of the projects are:
"American Factory," about a Chinese-owned factory in post-industrial Ohio; "Bloom," an upstairs/downstairs drama series set in the world of fashion in post-WWII New York that depicts barriers faced by women and by people of color; a feature film adaptation of author David W. Blight's "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," for which he won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in History; "Overlooked," an adaptation of The New York Times "Overlooked" obituary column, about deaths unreported by the paper; "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents," a half-hour preschool series; "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," a nonfiction series that will portray the importance of unheralded work done by everyday heroes guiding our government; "Crip Camp," a documentary about a 1970s summer camp for teenagers with disabilities.
Higher Ground has made a point of focusing on stories that reflect a range of "interests and experiences" but are "relevant to our daily lives," Michelle Obama said. "We think there's something here for everyone - moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day."
- Variety
Women unite: Typically, female country artists only get one or two slots on a tour or festival. But on Carrie Underwood's Cry Pretty Tour 360, six women will be behind the mic throughout the show. Underwood picked duo Maddie & Tae and trio Runaway June to open for her arena tour that starts Wednesday in Greensboro, N.C. The seven-time Grammy winner says it's a great time for women to come together and support each other.
Cave boys: Netflix announced it will join with the "Crazy Rich Asians" production company (SK Global Entertainment) to make a film about last July's dramatic rescue of 12 village boys in northern Thailand who were trapped with their soccer coach in a flooded cave for more than two weeks.
Wango Taylor: Taylor Swift has been added to the lineup of the iHeartRadio Wango Tango concert June 1 in Carson, Calif. She will also open Wednesday's Billboard Music Awards with a performance of her new single, "ME!" Ryan Seacrest hosts Wango Tango, which will also feature the Jonas Brothers, Halsey, 5 Seconds of Summer, Zedd, Ally Brooke, Tyga, Ava Max, Fletcher and TOMORROW X TOGETHER. Tickets go on sale Friday.

'Jeopardy!' Champs on Life Beyond the Buzzer

Texto completo: James Holzhauer is officially "Jeopardy!" royalty.
Not only has he come to dominate the list of highest single-game payouts, but Holzhauer has also become only the second contestant to earn more than $ 1 million in regular-season play. On Monday night, he continued his streak, winning his 18th game by just $ 18.
For some contestants, winning might usher in 15 minutes of fame and a small, unexpected windfall. But for players like Holzhauer, securing records, fame and big winnings can be transformative, creating opportunities and providing a level of financial security unthinkable to many Americans.
We caught up with a few "Jeopardy!" stars to ask them how their time on the show affected their lives.
Ken Jennings
Before he became a "Jeopardy!" legend, Ken Jennings was a 29-year-old computer programmer living in Salt Lake City, wondering if there was any way out of a career in coding.
"My wife says I kept talking about going to law school, that's how desperate I was," he joked.
Jennings had double-majored in English and computer science and always wanted to write, but after graduating and getting engaged he took a job at a tech start-up to pay the bills. Then he qualified for "Jeopardy!"
In 2004, Jennings won 74 games in a row, earning more than $ 2.5 million. No one has come close to beating his streak (the nearest challenger won 20 consecutive games), though Holzhauer is closing in.
In April, Holzhauer became the only contestant to join Jennings in earning more than $ 1 million in regular-season play. (Another contestant, Brad Rutter, has earned more than either of them, but he earned the vast majority of his winnings -- more than $ 4.5 million -- in arguably more difficult tournament games.)
[We asked James Holzhauer how he turned "Jeopardy!" into his own A.T.M.]
For Jennings, "Jeopardy!" significantly altered the course of his life. "It changed what I did every day," he said.
After the show, Jennings decided to write a book about the history and appeal of trivia in America. In 2006, he published "Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs," which did well enough for him to keep going.
"Each book sold better than the last, which is what publishers are into," he said.
[Video: KEN JENNINGS: 'JEOPARDY! CHANGED EVERYTHING' | J!Effect Watch on YouTube.]
His books since include a trivia almanac, a debunking of myths passed down to children, and a book about how comedy has come to dominate culture. Jennings says he is now working on his 13th book, a travel guide to various depictions of the afterlife throughout human history.
(When he isn't writing books, Jennings writes about travel and trivia online and hosts, with the musician John Roderick, a podcast about historical oddities called "Omnibus!")

More than anything, his time on "Jeopardy!" gave him precious freedom from a rigid career.
"The main thing that the show got me, honestly, is that I don't work a 9-to-5 anymore," he said. "I'm a freelancer, so I can be here when my kids come home from school, I can drive them to the bus, I can go to the midday middle school choir concert. To me, that means more than the money, honestly."
Larissa Kelly
For Larissa Kelly, appearing on the show in 2008 and 2009 provided a lifeline for her and her husband, who were graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, facing a job market in the throes of the Great Recession.
"Having the money from 'Jeopardy!' meant that we had the freedom to think about where do we want to go, what do we want to do," said Kelly, whose appearances then and since have made her one of the highest-earning contestants in the show's history, with winnings of more than $ 660,000.
The money has allowed Kelly and her husband, Jeff Hoppes, to buy a house in Richmond, Calif., and given them the freedom to pursue jobs related to what they love.
"For the last six or seven years, we've both been doing professional trivia, and it was feasible for us to do that in a way that I don't think it would have been without the cushion provided by 'Jeopardy!'," she said.
[Related: Why America Loves Alex Trebek]
Kelly now edits questions for National Academic Quiz Tournaments, which runs national quiz bowl championships at the middle school, high school and collegiate levels. Her husband is the organization's vice president for communication.
Unlike other "Jeopardy!" champions, though, Kelly doesn't get much opportunity to gloat. Not only were her sister and husband on the show, but Jennings, who beat her husband, is also a colleague at National Academic Quiz Tournaments.
"For a lot of people, it's likely that they might be the only person at their company who was on 'Jeopardy!'," she said. "For me, I am never going to be the premier 'Jeopardy!' player at my company."
Monica Thieu
Monica Thieu was technically still in high school when she first appeared on the show, but because she was enrolled in classes at the University of North Texas, she was allowed to compete in the show's college championship in 2012.
Thieu won the title and $ 100,000, a prize that helped her pay for tuition at Stanford University.
"We might not have been able to afford it if we didn't have the 'Jeopardy!' money," she said.
At Stanford, Thieu worked in a psychology laboratory dedicated to the research of memory. She graduated in three years as a psychology major and is now a Ph.D. student at Columbia University, where she mostly studies how people perceive emotions.
[Quiz: Can you answer these real "Jeopardy!" questions that feature The New York Times?]
The show, she said, probably enabled that career path.
"If I had gone somewhere else, I might have done something else," she said. "I might have made my parents happy and been in medical school right now."
Thieu appeared again on "Jeopardy!" in 2013 and for this year's "All-Star Games" (in which she played on Jennings's team).
Since her first appearance, though, Thieu has avoided telling people up front about her time on the show for fear that it would come to define her.
"I don't want to be the 'Jeopardy!' girl," she said. "I would like to be the girl that has these other hobbies and interests."
Fortunately, it hasn't been much of a problem. Aside from a few fan encounters, Thieu has, for the most part, continued to live a life of anonymity.

Before Holzhauer obliterated the record in April, the title for most money won in a single game of "Jeopardy!" belonged to Roger Craig. (Before him, it belonged to Jennings.)
Craig became famous among fans of the show not only for that record -- which he claimed by winning $ 77,000 in a single game in late 2010 -- but also for how he achieved it.
To prepare for the game, Craig, who was finishing graduate school at the time, used a background in machine learning to analyze tens of thousands of past "Jeopardy!" questions and answers, which he downloaded from a fan-run website. He used his findings to direct his studies for the show and to hone his strategy during the game.
"That was probably the biggest thing that was unique to me, was becoming known for that because it was also related to my line of work," Craig said.
But unlike other big winners, his life did not hugely change after he appeared on the show.
His sizable winnings gave him some financial freedom, but he still works in machine learning and artificial intelligence, now as a consultant, he said. And while people recognize him from the show, that recognition fades with the passage of time.
Appearing on "Jeopardy!" and in subsequent interviews with journalists did, however, help strengthen Craig's public speaking abilities.
"Once you've done a television show and you're up there in front of millions of people, to me, speaking in front of a few hundred or a few thousand people is not a big deal," he said.

Texto completo: It has been only 10 years since the decades-long civil war in Sri Lanka ended. Now the island has been hit by violence again, with a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks that killed nearly 300 people. These books offer context about the country and the toll that the tension between the Buddhist majority and Tamil minority has had on its people.
THIS DIVIDED ISLAND
Life, Death and the Sri Lankan War
Samanth Subramanian
336 pp. Thomas Dunne Books. (2015)
The Sri Lankan Civil War, which lasted nearly 30 years and ended in 2009, was a bloody conflict borne from the tension between minority Tamil groups and Sinhalese Buddhists. Subramanian recounts the war and its aftermath, exploring how war and mass death changed the country and its people.
ISLAND OF A THOUSAND MIRRORS
By Nayomi Munaweera
242 pp. St. Martin's Press. (2014)
This novel is told from the perspective of two girls, Yasodhara and Saraswathie, whose lives become connected after Saraswathie, who is Tamil, is arrested by a group of Sinhala soldiers. "The beating heart of 'Island of a Thousand Mirrors' is not so much its human characters but Sri Lanka itself and the vivid, occasionally incandescent, language used to describe this teardrop in the Indian Ocean," our reviewer wrote.
RUNNING IN THE FAMILY
By Michael Ondaatje
208 pp. Vintage International. (1983)
In this memoir, Ondaatje, who would go on to win the Booker Prize for his novel "The English Patient," writes about his return to his native Sri Lanka in the late 1970s. He digs into his family's Dutch-Ceylonese heritage and describes growing up in 1940s Sri Lanka, before his family left when he was 11.

Mueller complained to Barr about memo

Texto completo: Special counsel: Preview of report lacked 'context' and led to 'confusion'
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III wrote a letter in late March complaining to Attorney General William P. Barr that a four-page memo to Congress describing the principal conclusions of the investigation into President Trump "did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance" of Mueller's work, according to a copy of the letter reviewed Tuesday by The Washington Post.
The letter and a subsequent phone call between the two men reveal the degree to which the longtime colleagues and friends disagreed as they handled the legally and politically fraught task of investigating the president. Democrats in Congress are likely to scrutinize Mueller's complaints to Barr as they contemplate the prospect of opening impeachment proceedings and mull how hard to press for Mueller himself to testify publicly.
At the time Mueller's letter was sent to Barr on March 27, Barr had days prior announced that Mueller did not find a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials seeking to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. In his memo to Congress, Barr also said that Mueller had not reached a conclusion about whether Trump had tried to obstruct justice, but that Barr reviewed the evidence and found it insufficient to support such a charge.
Days after Barr's announcement, Mueller wrote the previously undisclosed private letter to the Justice Department, laying out his concerns in stark terms that shocked senior Justice Department officials, according to people familiar with the discussions.
"The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work and conclusions," Mueller wrote. "There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations."
The letter made a key request: that Barr release the 448-page report's introductions and executive summaries, and it made initial suggested redactions for doing so, according to Justice Department officials. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations.
A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.
Justice Department officials said Tuesday that they were taken aback by the tone of Mueller's letter and that it came as a surprise to them that he had such concerns. Until they received the letter, they believed Mueller was in agreement with them on the process of reviewing the report and redacting certain types of information, a process that took several weeks. Barr has testified to Congress previously that Mueller declined the opportunity to review his four-page memo to lawmakers that distilled the essence of the special counsel's findings.
In his letter to Barr, Mueller wrote that the redaction process "need not delay release of the enclosed materials. Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation."
Barr is scheduled to appear Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee - a much-anticipated public confrontation between the nation's top law enforcement official and Democratic lawmakers, where he is likely to be questioned at length about his interactions with Mueller.
A day after Mueller sent his letter to Barr, the two men spoke by phone for about 15 minutes, according to law enforcement officials.
In that call, Mueller said he was concerned media coverage of the obstruction probe was misguided and creating public misunderstandings about the office's work, according to Justice Department officials. Mueller did not express similar concerns about the public discussion of the investigation of Russia's election interference, the officials said. Barr has testified previously that he did not know whether Mueller supported his conclusion on obstruction.
When Barr pressed Mueller on whether he thought Barr's memo to Congress was inaccurate, Mueller said he did not but felt media coverage of it was misinterpreting the investigation, officials said.
In their call, Barr also took issue with Mueller calling his memo a "summary," saying he had never intended to summarize the voluminous report, but instead provide an account of its top conclusions, officials said.
Justice Department officials said that, in some ways, the phone conversation was more cordial than the letter that preceded it, but that the two men did express some differences of opinion about how to proceed.
Barr said he did not want to put out pieces of the report, but rather issue the document all at once with redactions, and that he didn't want to change course, according to officials. Barr also gave Mueller his personal phone number and told him to call if he had future concerns, officials said.
Throughout the conversation, Mueller's main worry was that the public was not getting an accurate understanding of the obstruction investigation, officials said.
"After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller's letter, he called him to discuss it," a Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday evening in a statement. "In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General's March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel's obstruction analysis. They then discussed whether additional context from the report would be helpful and could be quickly released.
"However, the Attorney General ultimately determined that it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion," the spokeswoman said. "The Attorney General and the Special Counsel agreed to get the full report out with necessary redactions as expeditiously as possible. The next day, the Attorney General sent a letter to Congress reiterating that his March 24 letter was not intended to be a summary of the report, but instead only stated the Special Counsel's principal conclusions, and volunteered to testify before both Senate and House Judiciary Committees on May 1 and 2."
Some senior Justice Department officials were frustrated by Mueller's complaints because they had expected that the report would reach them with proposed redactions, but it did not. Even when Mueller sent along his suggested redactions, those covered only a few areas of protected information, and the documents required further review, these people said.
The Washington Post and the New York Times had previously reported some members of Mueller's team were frustrated with Barr's characterization of their work, though Mueller's own attitude was unknown before now.
In some team members' view, the evidence they had gathered - especially on obstruction - was far more alarming and significant than how Barr had described it. That was perhaps to be expected, given that Barr had distilled a 448-page report into a terse, four-page memo to Congress.
Wednesday's hearing will be the first time lawmakers question Barr since the Mueller report was released on April 18, and he is expected to face a raft of tough questions from Democrats.
Republicans on the committee are expected to question Barr about an assertion he made earlier in April that government officials had engaged in "spying" on the Trump campaign - a comment that was seized on by the president's supporters as evidence the investigation into the president was biased.
Barr is also scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee, but that hearing could be canceled or postponed amid a dispute about whether committee staff lawyers will question the attorney general. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel's chairman, called for a copy of the Mueller letter to be delivered to his committee by Wednesday morning.
Democrats have accused Barr of downplaying the seriousness of the evidence against the president. Mueller's report described 10 significant episodes of possible obstruction of justice but said that because of long-standing Justice Department policy that says a sitting president cannot be indicted and because of Justice Department practice regarding fairness toward those under investigation, his team did not reach a conclusion about whether the president had committed a crime.

Domineque Ray, set to be executed by the state of Alabama in February, made an appeal to have his imam by his side at his death. To deny him that was unconstitutional, Ray’s lawyers argued. Christian chaplains had been present for Alabama executions for years. Ray’s appeal made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In a 5-4 ruling, the court said no to Ray. Ray’s request, it held, came too late, and it would have required Alabama to train Ray’s chosen imam in security measures in order for him to be present for the execution.
Justice Elena Kagan, dissenting, saw the ruling as a grave mistake.
“To justify such religious discrimination, the State must show that its policy is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest,” she wrote. “I have no doubt that prison security is an interest of that kind. But the State has offered no evidence to show that its wholesale prohibition on outside spiritual advisers is necessary to achieve that goal.”
Ray, without his spiritual counselor, was executed on Feb. 7.
Ray’s loss before the Supreme Court was his final defeat over decades of legal argument. Ray, convicted of killing three teenagers in the 1990s, had insisted prosecutors withheld critical evidence. He’d argued that his lawyers were inadequate. ProPublica examined at length one of Ray’s central claims: That his lawyers had failed to introduce compelling evidence of his history of abuse and trauma during the penalty phase of his second murder trial.
All of those appeals failed, however, gaining little national attention. His scheduled execution was on track to happen without great note in a state with one of the highest rates for capital punishment. The Supreme Court’s involvement, however, changed that. Ray’s case, complete with Kagan’s notably vivid dissent, was the first of several the court dealt with in a span of weeks. The series of rulings — in a Texas case and another in a Missouri case — struck many veteran observers as remarkable. The justices seemed to be arguing angrily about the facts of the cases, but also about whether they were being properly debated.
“Supreme Court justices feuding openly over death penalty,” read one headline.
“The Supreme Court’s Bitter Feud Over a Controversial Death Penalty Case Boils Over Into the Public,” read another.
On April 1, Adam Liptak, the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times, wrote one of the articles, with the headline “Rancor and Raw Emotion Surface in Supreme Court Death Penalty Ruling.” The article referenced all three cases and offered a full variety of the vigorous back-and-forth among the justices.
We reached out to Liptak to give us some context and insight into the recent dust-ups over the death penalty. A graduate of Yale Law School, Liptak practiced law for 14 years before joining The New York Times' news staff in 2002. He was a finalist for the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in explanatory reporting. He has taught courses on the Supreme Court and the First Amendment at several law schools, including Yale and the University of Chicago.
The justices in the Ray case decided on the single question of whether the failure to allow him an imam at his execution violated his rights. In such late appeals, do the justices typically have much sense of the additional details of the case and a defendant’s prior appeals? We ask because we spent a lot of time examining Ray’s claims concerning his penalty phase representation. Would the justices likely have known much of that disputed case history?
Even in cases decided on the merits after full briefing and argument, the Supreme Court tends to consider only one or two discrete legal questions. In March, for instance, it heard arguments on only the question of whether there had been race discrimination in the sixth trial of Curtis Flowers, a death row inmate in Mississippi, even though the podcast “In the Dark” had raised a host of substantial questions about his guilt.
The justices are even less likely to consider questions beyond the ones they were asked to decide when cases reach them in the context of emergency applications in death penalty cases. They often have only hours to act, and they seldom look beyond the lower court rulings granting or denying stays of execution and the parties’ hastily assembled briefs.
On the night the Supreme Court allowed Ray’s execution to proceed, the justices were also distracted by another emergency application, one that at the time had a higher profile, concerning a Louisiana abortion law.
I would add that the five conservative justices in the majority did not understand themselves to be deciding “whether the failure to allow him an imam at his execution violated his rights.” They said they were deciding whether he had raised his claim too late.

Domineque Ray Is Set to Be Executed Thursday. Did He Ever Really Have a Chance at Being Spared?
The U.S. Supreme Court has said juries must consider a defendant’s life, education and mental health before voting for execution. Lawyers for an Alabama man say that never happened in 1999, and now it’s too late.
Domineque Ray Is Executed in Alabama After Supreme Court Bid Fails
Ray, convicted of three murders 20 years ago, had lost a variety of appeals alleging prosecutorial misconduct and inadequate counsel. On Thursday night, his request to have an imam in the execution chamber was also denied.
Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general for the Obama administration, tweeted of the Ray ruling that “100 years from now, law students will read about this decision. It may be read alongside Dred Scott, Plessy v. Ferguson, Korematsu, and the Chinese Exclusion Act cases.” Katyal shares a lot of his opinions on television these days and is a fierce critic of the Trump administration. What do you make of this one?
The ruling in the Ray case was met with disapproval across the political spectrum and especially from conservatives devoted to religious liberty.
In her dissent for the court’s four liberal members, Justice Elena Kagan called the decision “profoundly wrong.” That is strong language from a member of the court who is ordinarily quite measured.
So while there might have been a bit of hyperbole in what Neal said, it did capture the profound disappointment over what a lot of people thought was an ill-considered ruling. Indeed, the court itself came to the opposite conclusion in a very similar case a couple of months later, by an apparent 7-2 vote.
In the case you wrote about, one that had provoked “rancor and raw emotion” among the justices, there seemed to be some anger about “re-litigating” the Ray case. Is that a common complaint? Are justices not typically supposed to do that?
It was unusual to see the heated exchanges over the Ray case in yet a third death penalty ruling, this one concerning a Missouri inmate’s claim that he would suffer excruciating pain if executed using the state’s lethal-injection protocol. The justices try to keep things civil and to move on after big disagreements. A key rule at the court, Justice Stephen G. Breyer has said, is that “tomorrow is another day.” In the Ray case, the court seems to be disregarding that rule.
The ruling in the Ray case was one of several the court has made in death penalty appeals of late. Is there something larger going on, do you think, as you read the decisions? One law professor said that “these three death penalty cases may demonstrate the court's growing pains as it moves further away from the ideological center.”
That’s one way to put it. I’d say there is frustration and impatience on the right over what it perceives to be endless delays and gamesmanship in death penalty litigation and an increasing discomfort on the left with capital punishment as such.

Texto completo: The act of atoning may be difficult and complicated, but the concept is simple enough: You did something bad and it caused harm. A basic sense of decency urges you to take measures to, at worst, express how sorry you are, and at best, do something to right the wrong.
On the other side of atonement, we find forgiveness. One does not happen without the other. History has shown us that both of these acts are difficult, and yet both are necessary to maintain a cooperative and functioning society.
I know a few things about mistakes and second chances. As a formerly incarcerated youth and high school dropout, when I decided to run for a state legislative seat, I needed my community to know that not only was I sorry for the many transgressions of my young adult life, but also that I had taken those experiences and learned from them. I learned to treat my mistakes not as points of shame, but as opportunities for growth. It's those experiences with tough moments that inform my approach to accountability today, and why I believe it matters that people acknowledge when they do wrong.
The #MeToo movement wasn't just a flash in the pan. It marked a profound tectonic shift toward continued female empowerment and self-realization that's still evolving, and the ongoing rumbling continues to cause all kinds of discomfort.
After centuries of oppression, subjugation, and dehumanization, women finally began finding their individual voices in the security of a collective chorus. We tapped into a newfound power that, first and foremost, demanded accountability, and the offenders were plentiful and easy to spot. The worst of the worst were forced out of their systemic fortresses of protection. Rapists, sexual assaulters, sexual harassers -- villains who refused to acknowledge their actions, much less atone for their behavior. Powerful, rich, and famous men who acted with impunity, some for decades, were finally brought to some version of justice.
And then there was Joe Biden.
Not a villain. Not an unlikable person. Not a sexual harasser or assaulter. But also, as Anita Hill recently found out, not exactly sorry, either.
I wrote about my own experience with Mr. Biden last month -- about the time in 2014 that he grabbed my shoulders, smelled my hair, and kissed the back of my head -- and soon after, other women came forward about their own experiences with uninvited and unwanted intimate behavior in professional settings. Even though his defenders reduced the behavior to "hugging" (it was not) and shifted the focus to his intent (it was good intent!) and made up false political motives to shift the attention to me (she endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2016!), most reasonable people understood that this kind of behavior with women violates not just their bodily autonomy but also demonstrates a lack of basic understanding of social norms. Most people acknowledge that men don't usually kiss, smell, rub noses with, place their hands on the thighs of, or touch foreheads with random women they don't know. Yet some men do, especially powerful men, who are protected by privilege and a crew of self-interested enablers who don't want to lose their access to power by calling out the obvious.
The subsequent conversation produced a few uncomfortable questions: What level of accountability is necessary when the offender is someone you like and has also done good things for society, including women? What is the appropriate punishment when the behavior is wrong and unwanted and violates basic consent principles, but doesn't rise to the level of harassment or assault? What do we do when the offender hasn't bothered to take the first step toward forgiveness?
Society doesn't do well with gray areas, but gray is exactly what we need. We have to acknowledge that there is egregious behavior that is clearly wrong and, in most cases, also illegal, but we also have to recognize that there's plenty of behavior that is not illegal but is still wrong, and that we shouldn't have to tolerate. We need to acknowledge and call out bad behavior no matter who does it, and then we have to allow for fair and measured accountability. Just as with the criminal justice system, we have to make room for people who have made mistakes and we have to take their pasts and mitigating circumstances into consideration. We have to consider their willingness to atone. And we should be willing to forgive.
Intuitively, I think many people, especially in politics, are afraid to acknowledge wrongdoing. Or perhaps their arrogance or egos get in the way. Yet research indicates that a "sorry" goes a long way. In medical malpractice settings, a study found that 43 percent of cases in which medical errors led to injury were resolved with an apology alone.
In the context of the Democratic primary election, no candidate is going to be perfect. Not all of them will have made women uncomfortable; not all of them will have to account for their role in something as controversial and painful for the country as the Clarence Thomas hearings. But all will have made mistakes of some sort in their personal lives, made votes and taken positions you don't agree with, or disappointed someone at some point. We tend to forget that candidates are people; people are imperfect, and they should be allowed to evolve. If all we do is call people out and demand accountability, but don't give them credit for actually doing what is asked, then we're not working for change -- we're working to make ourselves feel righteously outraged by shaming everybody else.
But evolution can't come without a genuine effort to seek atonement.
What we can learn from the #MeToo movement is that when we demand accountability and work together to actually change culture by changing behaviors and attitudes, we collectively usher in real transformation. If a candidate has taken some questionable positions, or done or said some questionable things, we must ask, what have they done to show they have actually learned and evolved? Ultimately though, the easiest way to fairly assess whether or not someone has truly learned, evolved, and atoned, is to watch their actions. Because when people show you who they are, we should believe them.

WHO: MALARIA VACCINE WILL GO TO 360,000 KIDS IN 3 AFRICAN COUNTRIES

Texto completo: Some 360,000 children a year in three African countries will receive the world's first malaria vaccine as part of a large-scale pilot program, the World Health Organization said last week.
Malawi has started vaccinating children younger than 2, and Kenya and Ghana will begin using the vaccine in the coming weeks, with health ministries in these countries deciding where it will be used, WHO said.
The vaccine offers partial protection from the disease, with clinical trials finding that it prevented approximately 4 in 10 malaria cases, according to WHO.
"We have seen tremendous gains from bed nets and other measures to control malaria in the last 15 years, but progress has stalled and even reversed in some areas. We need new solutions to get the malaria response back on track, and this vaccine gives us a promising tool to get there," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.
"The malaria vaccine has the potential to save tens of thousands of children's lives."
Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is both preventable and treatable, yet an estimated 435,000 people die of it each year.
Children under 5 are at the greatest risk of its life-threatening complications, and according to WHO, it claims the life of one child every two minutes. Most of these deaths are in Africa, where more than 250,000 children die from the disease every year.
The vaccine, RTS,S, also known as Mosquirix, was created by scientists at the British pharmaceutical giant GSK in 1987. It has undergone years of testing and was supported by numerous organizations including the nonprofit PATH.
From 2000 to 2015, there was a 62% reduction in malaria deaths, according to WHO, and a 41% reduction in the number of cases. However, more recent data suggests that malaria is making a comeback, with 219 million cases in 2017, compared with 217 million in 2016.
"It's a difficult disease to deal with. The tools we have are modestly effective, but drugs and insecticides wear out; after 10, 20 years, mosquitoes become resistant. There's a real concern that in 2020s, [cases] are going to jump back up again," said Adrian Hill, a professor of human genetics and director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford.
The vaccine will be given in four doses: three doses between 5 months and 9 months of age and the fourth dose around the 2nd birthday.
WHO said the vaccine was a "complementary malaria control tool" to be used in addition to bed nets treated with insecticide, spraying indoor areas with insecticides and prompt diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
The New York Times contributed.

Texto completo: Laura Linney is returning to Broadway next winter in "My Name Is Lucy Barton," a one-woman show that is transferring from London.
The play, adapted by Rona Munro from the novel of the same name by Elizabeth Strout, is about a writer whose unexpected reunion with her mother in a hospital room prompts a reckoning with the hardships of her childhood in rural Illinois.
The play had two runs in London, last June and then again in January and February, at the Bridge Theater. "I found Laura Linney radiating shadow-streaked sunlight," the critic Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times.
[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]
The Broadway production will be presented by the Manhattan Theater Club and the London Theater Company, in association with Penguin Random House Audio, and directed by Richard Eyre, who also directed the London production. It is scheduled to begin previews Jan. 6 and to open on Jan. 15.
Ms. Linney, a prolific performer on film and television, is also a four-time Tony nominee who mostly recently appeared on Broadway in a 2017 revival of "The Little Foxes."

French ambassador: US press ‘so anti-Trump that I do understand’ Trump going direct to the people

Texto completo: Gérard Araud, the outgoing French ambassador to the United States, said he sympathizes with President Trump and how he handles the “anti-Trump” press.

“The press, to be frank, is so anti-Trump that I do understand that the natural reaction of Trump is to go over the head of the press,” Araud told the New York Times.

Trump, who Araud described as a “big mouth,” has long railed against the “fake news” media. Some of his favorite targets are the New York Times, CNN, and NBC, particularly over their coverage of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and unflattering reports about him or his administration.

Although Trump does agree to interviews with the press, particularly Fox News, he often gets his message across to his supporters through Twitter or rallies.

Araud compared changes in the Republican Party under Trump to shifts in conservative parties in Western Europe. Araud said Republicans used to focus on free trade and limited government spending, but now are “shifting to protectionism, nationalism, defense of the identity.”

Araud also critiqued Trump. He said in an interview with CNN last week that the Trump administration was “dysfunctional” on multiple fronts and Washington, D.C., feels “personally attacked” by the president.

“You have a city that feels frightened and personally attacked by Trump,” Araud told the Times. “At every dinner, you have anecdotes about Donald Trump. And you leave Washington, D.C., and you can spend two days in Seattle and Chicago and nobody says the word ‘Trump.’”

Araud, 66, has served as the French ambassador since 2014. He is heading to Manhattan to write a memoir and may accept a position with communications firm Attias.

In kickoff rally, Joe Biden slams Trump tax cuts

Texto completo: During his campaign kickoff rally in Pittsburgh, former Vice President Joe Biden railed against the GOP-led tax cuts enacted in December of 2017. Biden said the benefits from the tax cuts went to corporations and CEOs, rather than middle and working-class employees.

"Let me say this simply and clearly, and I mean this: The country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, and hedge fund managers, it was built by you. It was built by the great American middle class," Biden told a thunderous western Pennsylvania audience.

"The middle class is hurting. It’s hurting now. Fifty-three percent of the folks in America don’t think their children are going to have the same standard of living they had. To the best of my knowledge, that’s the first time that’s happened in a long, long, long time. The stock market is roaring, but you don’t feel it. There’s a $2 trillion tax cut last year. Did you feel it? Did you get anything from it?" he asked the crowd. "Of course not. Of course not. All of it went to folks at the top and corporations that pay no taxes. "

The event marked Biden's first campaign since announcing his candidacy by video last Thursday. Biden served as President Barack Obama's vice president for eight years, after 36 years in the Senate.

On Monday he talked up familiar working-class themes.

"I see people understand that being middle class is not a number, it’s a value set. It’s being able to send your kid to a park where you know they’re going to come home safely," Biden said. "It’s being able to own your own home and not just have to rent. It’s being able to send your kid to a good school, and if they do well, they can go beyond high school, to trade school or college or beyond."

The New York Times reported most Americans got a tax cut as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, though many Americans incorrectly thought they did not.

Apple removing or restricting apps for controlling screen time

Texto completo: Apple’s removal of nearly a dozen apps that help users manage screen time raises questions about the company’s dominance and its commitment to helping people stay off their iPhones amid concerns about the negative effects of smartphones, including on children,according to a new report.
The report by the New York Times on Saturday came just days after Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the Time 100 Summit last week that his company “has never wanted to maximize user time” because it’s “not motivated from a business or values point of view” to do so.
That’s not what developers who have had their apps removed or severely restricted say. They complained to the Times that after Apple released its own screen-time tracker last September, the company began to crack down on similar apps. An Apple spokeswoman told the newspaper that the company is concerned that the apps were accessing too much customer information.
In addition, Phil Schiller, Apple vice president for worldwide marketing, reiterated to customers that the company’s crackdown is related to privacy concerns. The Times included a portion of Schiller’s response in its story, and MacRumors published the response in its entirety.
Schiller said the apps Apple removed were using Mobile Device Management technology, which he said is meant to be used by companies to manage devices used by their employees, to access and control iPhone users’ devices.
“No one, except you, should have unrestricted access to manage your child’s device, know their location, track their app use, control their mail accounts, web surfing, camera use, network access, and even remotely erase their devices,” Schiller said in an email to a customer.
The Times also noted that Apple is facing antitrust complaints from Kidslox and Qustodio, two popular parental-control apps, in Europe. The company is facing other accusations of abusing its App Store’s dominance, such as Spotify complaining to European regulators that Apple gave its Apple Music service an unfair advantage over it in the music-streaming world. In the United States, politicians and others have raised concerns about tech giants’ dominance. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, thinks Apple should be separated from its App Store as part of her push to rein in tech companies.
An iPhone user quoted by the Times said Apple’s parental-control tools are not as good as the apps he preferred to use before they were forced to remove key features. And Tony Fadell, the co-creator of the iPhone who is no longer at Apple, weighed in on Twitter, including in his comments a dig at Apple’s response to the report: “Apple’s Screen Time still has many holes & deficiencies. Their v1.0 solution was a rush job & it’s very non-intuitive to use. Apple should be building true APIs for Screen Time so the ‘privacy’ concerns are taken into account instead of limiting users App Store choices.”
Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a Boston-based advocacy group, called on Apple to work with app makers and others so parents can continue to have choices.
“Parents need as many tools in the toolbox for limiting screen time as possible,” said Josh Grolin, executive director for the CCFC, said Monday. “If it’s true that Apple is eliminating the competition, that’s extremely disappointing and another indication that vertically integrated Big Tech companies have far too much power.”

Texto completo: President Barack Obama dissuaded Joe Biden from running for president in the 2016 election.

Obama thought that if his vice president ran, he would be beaten in the Democratic primaries by Hillary Clinton. In summer of 2015, Obama “gently pressed” Biden against his 2016 aspiration, according to the New York Times.

He also worried about Biden’s state of mind should he have decided to run. Biden was grieving over the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in May of 2015. Obama sent his own strategist to discuss the long odds to Biden.

“The president was not encouraging,” Biden said after the meeting. The report follows news Thursday that around that same time Biden met with senior adviser David Plouffe at Obama's behest. Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, asked Biden: “Do you really want it to end in a hotel room in Des Moines, coming in third to Bernie Sanders?”

Obama was by his vice president's side when Biden announced in the White House Rose Garden he was not running. Clinton went on to win the nomination after a tougher-than-expected battle with Sanders but lost the general election to Donald Trump in one of the biggest political upsets in modern history.

Biden, 76, is now in the running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. The most recent RealClearPolitics national average of polls has Biden leading the pack with 29.3% support. He claims he asked Obama not to endorse him in the 2020 race.

Although Obama aides say he will not endorse in Democratic primaries, his spokeswoman did praise Biden after he announced his campaign last week.

Choosing him as his running mate was "one of the best decisions he ever made,” said Katie Hill. “He relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today."

Stagecoach 2019: Sam Hunt closes out the second night with a big ‘ol dance party

Texto completo: By the time day two headliner Sam Hunt hit the stage at the 13th annual Stagecoach Country Music Festival, the fans were ready to dance at the Empire Polo Club in Indio.
During an interview ahead of the festival, Hunt said he hadn’t played a show in about six months but was ready to get back out to party with his fans at the festival. For a first-time headliner, Hunt’s performance was solid. He came out hard with “Leave the Night On” and transitioned into “House Party,” during which his crew unleashed dozens of giant balloons into the audience, which promptly blew away in the gusty desert winds.
Not all of Hunt’s songs are bangers, though, and he did pick up his acoustic guitar and slow things down a bit with songs like “Take Your Time,” “Cop Car,” a song he wrote for Keith Urban, and he jumped on the piano for “Make You Miss Me” during his encore. The fans danced and sang all the “woah-oh-oh’s” they could in “We Are Tonight,” a song Hunt wrote that was recorded by Billy Currington.
Though he’s not a traditional country artist since he mixes in elements of pop, rock, electronic dance music and R&B into his music, Hunt is a traditionalist at heart. He told the crowd he’d always tip his hat to those who paved the way within the country music genre and invited out fellow Mane Stage player Luke Combs to pay tribute to Brooks & Dunn with a cover of “Brand New Man.” Hunt also paid homage to the late Waylon Jennings with “Belle of the Ball.”
For his first Stagecoach appearance in 2016, Hunt surprised the audience by bringing out G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha and Snoop Dogg during his set, but this year he let his own material shine. After closing out with “Body Like a Back Road,” he did tell the audience he’d see them tomorrow, which might mean he’ll pop up at the festival’s first-ever official after party with EDM artist Diplo at the Palomino Stage after Aldean’s turn on Sunday.
While Luke Combs is an incredible songwriter and his ascent has been a quick one, unlike Hunt he is country through and through. He reminded the Stagecoach crowd when he took the Mane Stage just before Hunt he played this same fest at about 2:30 in the afternoon two years in front of about 1,000 people.
Since then, he’s scored five No. 1 hits and racked up the awards and accolades for songs such as “Hurricane,” “One Number Away” and “She Got the Best of Me,” all of which he put in his Stagecoach set. He also earned his spot, second to headliner, on the Mane Stage in front of 80,000 fans. That fact wasn’t lost on him as he told the crowd “five or six guys on stage get to live their dreams every night” because they spend their hard-earned money to come see them perform at things like Stagecoach.
He’s been touring on this album for some time and hit the audience with a few new songs including “Reasons” and “Beer Never Broke My Heart,” and during the latter he stopped and shotgunned a beer.
Singer-songwriter Cam has clawed her way up with time slots on the Mane Stage and finally landed herself the coveted sunset hour. The 34-year-old California native showed up in a colorful getup with lots of fringe and bedazzle not unlike a pack of Starburst. She opened with her single “Diane,” her fiery nod to Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” which she included near the end of her set as well. She’s always been bubbly, but on Saturday night she let her personality really shine, engaging with the crowd with more banter and confident interactions. She debuted Diplo’s new song, “So Long,” on which she guests, which dropped earlier this week and hinted that she might be over at his set on Sunday as well.
Before performing her first single, “My Mistake,” she told the crowd that the New York Times once called the song “sex positive,” which she took as a compliment. However, “…when women sing about sex it’s like a statement, but when a man sings about sex it’s just another Friday night,” she told the crowd.
“If you think sex isn’t as important to women as it is to men, than I gotta story about yo’ mama,” she added as the crowd cheered. She came out at the end of her set wearing a bedazzled cape to sing her big hit, “Burning House.”
Meanwhile, Lynyrd Skynyrd became the new record holder for crowd at the Palomino Stage, with fans spilling out of the tent for tens of yards in every direction. The band even outdrew its 2014 audience at the same location. Part of the attraction could be that it’s a last chance to see Southern rock’s defining band, as a long farewell tour wraps this year. And unlike many Palomino players, Lynyrd Skynyrd held the crowd’s attention for the full set.
The 75-minute performance packed in the hits, including “Gimme Three Steps,” “That Smell,” “Simple Man,” “Tuesday’s Gone,” “Don’t Ask Me No Questions,” and “Call Me the Breeze” before ending with “Sweet Home Alabama,” during which the crowd danced and drowned out the band with their own singing. But what would Skynyrd’s final Stagecoach bow be without “Free Bird” as an encore?
Other earlier highlights included Lanco’s fun set with its hits “Greatest Love Story,” “Trouble Maker” and “Born to Love You.” Michael Ray had fans singing along to “One That Got Away” and Jessie James Decker got the Mane Stage going early with covers of Shania Twain’s “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” and Led Zeppelin’s “What Is and What Should Never Be.”

SENATE QUARREL SETTLED WITHOUT LOSS OF BLOOD; WHAT WE SAID 150 YEARS AGO

Texto completo: This State Journal report ran on April 28, 1869, after U.S. Sen. William Sprague, R-R.I., had referred to U.S. Sen. Joseph Abbott, R-N.C., as a "mongrel puppy dog," to which Abbott responded by threatening "physical castigation." The New York Times described the ensuing dispute as "the most ferocious face-makings, and terrific threats ever witnessed." But an exchange of polite letters, negotiated by their colleagues, prevented violence:
The belligerent attitude that worthy Senators Sprague and Abbott have assumed for several days past has rendered them somewhat conspicuous before the country. A whipping, or a shooting, or something dreadful has seemed imminent for several days.
But to the great relief doubtless of both parties, the thing is all settled: Mr. Sprague didn't mean Abbott when he wrote his puppy-dog speech, and Mr. Abbott wishes it to be understood that he didn't say, what he did say, in the Senate, about the little Rhody senator.
So the honor of both is vindicated, and the one can return to his home without welts in his hide from a stick, and the other can go to high-toned North Carolina without bullet holes in his body.
This is all good and satisfactory, we hope to everybody. A sensation has been created, and wounded honor protected, without the loss of blood, or even a "spanking."

Marc Thiessen: Impeaching Trump will only help him

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt” nearly two hundred times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared “the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” He didn’t do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump’s impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, “unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.”
This lack of an “underlying crime” is the source of Trump’s justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You’d be angry and frustrated. You’d want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of “treason” and crimes of “a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.” He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia — evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn’t end it. He didn’t obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn’s cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, “that investigators would not have learned of otherwise.” This is evidence of Trump’s cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel’s report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: “Go ahead, make my day.” Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump’s reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump’s supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d’état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump’s approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump’s tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump’s returns to assess how “the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president”? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats’ attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump’s privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Come on, Joe Biden, apologize to Anita Hill

Texto completo: Just say you're sorry, Joe.
Take a deep breath, stand up tall and say it:
I'm sorry, Anita Hill, for how I treated you.
Simple. See?
Apologies, of course, are never simple, even when the words are. They require the relinquishing of pride, the acknowledgment of harm inflicted, a humility that can feel humiliating. So far the courage of such humility has eluded Joe Biden.
On Thursday, the former vice president announced that he's running for president, news that once again inflamed the public debate over his behavior toward Anita Hill.
Remember that? I do. If you were an adult in 1991, you remember too. The whole nation sat riveted to the TV as Hill, a young lawyer, testified before a committee of U.S. senators that Clarence Thomas, the new nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, had sexually harassed her while he was her supervisor.
In a vast, wood-paneled hearing room, a phalanx of men sat on a high platform looking down at a lone young woman. They were all white. She was black. Their questions and remarks were frequently curt, mocking, denigrating. I remember feeling I was witnessing an assault.
The committee was led by Sen. Joe Biden.
In the 28 years since, the world has "evolved," as we like to say, and so, it seems, has Biden. As a society, we take sexual harassment far more seriously, and Biden has acknowledged the wrong done to Hill.
"What happened," he has publicly stated, "was she got victimized again during the process."
What he hasn't clearly recognized is that he was a big part of that process.
Biden is sometimes described as an Everyman, a politician who can hobnob with the powerful but who also understands the regular people. He displays a genuine, if cagey, folksiness and, at the age of 76, wears a patina of experience that can pass for wisdom. He has endured great personal loss, most recently of his son, with dignity. He seems like a decent man.
And if to some detractors, he's "just another old white guy," he's also seen by his supporters as the candidate best fortified to beat the 72-year-old white guy currently in the job.
In pursuit of that job, Biden has made feints at apologizing to Hill.
In a recent public appearance, he called her brave and said she "paid a terrible price" for her courage.
"She was abused in the hearing," he said. "She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something."
On Friday, in an appearance on ABC's "The View," he said, "I'm sorry for the way she got treated."
But?
"I don't think I treated her badly."
A few days ago, The New York Times reported that Biden recently called Hill to express regret over what happened. His words fell on her ears as less than an apology.
She says she doesn't think Biden's behavior during the confirmation hearings disqualifies him. "I'm really open to people changing," she told The New York Times.
But, the Times noted, she said she can't support him for president unless he takes full responsibility for his conduct.
Anyone who has been in politics for a long time is apt to have things to apologize for. Making mistakes comes with the job. So does changing with the times, or it should.
Joe Biden of today seems more enlightened than the Biden of 1991. He championed the Violence Against Women Act. He has worked with a social movement called "It's On Us," which encourages men to take responsibility for stopping sexual assault and harassment. In those ways, he has stepped up to meet the times.
But Biden's reluctance to fully acknowledge his role in what happened to Anita Hill suggests a troubling blind spot.
Is it one that will be a make-or-break issue for voters? I wouldn't bet on it. There's even a theory that he's sidestepping a full apology because there's a group of voters -- those drawn to President Donald Trump -- who wouldn't want him to seem to cater to such liberal sensitivities.
But there are a lot of other voters waiting for Biden to prove that he's in touch with the new age, that he really has changed.
Come on, Joe. Exercise the strength of humility.
Keep evolving. Apologize. It's a form of leadership.

Texto completo: Incredibly, the dangerously titled Michael Jackson musical, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," is moving forward in New York.
Its creators are using what I'll call the "complexity defense." It is fascinating and has implications far beyond Jackson and his legacy.
First, let's review. The Tribune first reported Jan. 23 that the Broadway-bound musical, a jukebox biography focused around Jackson's "Dangerous" world tour, would try out in Chicago this fall. That engagement subsequently was canceled, seemingly in the immediate wake of the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland," wherein two adult males, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, claimed, in withering detail, that the "King of Pop" had abused them at his Neverland ranch when both were underage boys.
However, the producers of the show, which include the Jackson estate, claimed that the cancellation was a result of a workshop session being delayed by a now-resolved dispute involving Actors Equity. Whatever the truth, the timing was certainly striking.
This week, though, news came that the show was, as promised, continuing to wend toward Broadway in 2020, albeit without an out-of-town engagement.
You can see why the Jackson estate, which has attacked the allegations in the documentary as baseless, financially motivated slander, wants the project to continue. Many recent cases involving revelations or allegations of past abusive or inappropriate behavior have resulted in fevered debate over how to handle the disgraced individual's previous works of art.
Is it still OK to watch early Miramax films in the wake of Harvey Weinstein? What about the films of Kevin Spacey? Those are merely the two most obvious examples of countless actors, directors, writers and painters under new scrutiny.
But those are works in the past; the Jackson musical is in the future. It is one thing to argue that the brilliant artistry of, say, Jackson's album "Off the Wall" is not invalidated by the artist's personal behavior, but it's another to actually create a whole new work around his brand.
Estates, though, are trusted with both curating and maximizing creative projects building on the work of deceased artists, further defining their legacy. If "Don't Stop" were to be canceled, it would put a chill on any and all future Jackson projects. So wherever you stand on this issue, their persistence is logical.
And it explains why, say, Louis C.K. keeps wanting to do stand-up and why there are two debates. One set of arguments surrounds the dispensation of Louis C.K. in the past, and another surrounds what he should be allowed to do in the future. And for those who argue for so-called "cancellation," it is the future work that is the more egregious.
Look at the recent scandals surrounding racially insensitive statues or murals in schools, depicting very different Americas from the past. Debate ensues about whether they should be removed. Imagine, though, that someone had suggested painting a new one in the old way.
So what about Lynn Nottage and Christopher Wheeldon, the two creative artists charged with the Jackson project? In recent days, both have given interviews in which they try to thread a very fine needle.
Nottage, the book writer, first told Baz Bamigboye of the Daily Mail that she "believed" Robson and Safechuck, reflecting the argument that survivors of abuse historically have had great difficulty in being heard, and, therefore, now deserve to be believed.
"I think they were telling the truth," she said.
Which begs the question: Why are you participating in a musical produced by an estate that is calling the two men liars?
The statement also infuriated Jackson fans, who called for Nottage to be fired. And, presumably, it upset the estate, given their public statements on the matter.
Then, in a judicious subsequent interview with the New York Times, Nottage walked that back: "What I was saying, and what I was getting at," she told Michael Paulson, "is that the men came across as very believable. But here's the caveat: Were they ultimately telling the truth? I cannot 100 percent say so because I'm not judge and jury, and it's not my place to do that."
That is a fair point: The documentary was not a court of law and its content, most fair-minded people would say, did not rise to the level of legal proof. And the accused had no chance to defend himself. But then again, very few of the recent cases discussed above have been fully resolved in a court of law.
Weinstein is about to stand trial, but his detractors have not waited for a verdict to condemn. It is hard to imagine someone now making a musical about him, or his auteurship, or anyone buying a ticket.
In the Times interview, both Nottage and Wheeldon essentially said we're artists, we understand complexity, none of us is wholly good or wholly bad and we're going to create an art work that reflects both those sides of Michael Jackson.
To wit.
Wheeldon: "This is obviously challenging -- it makes this not without its complications, for sure -- but part of what we do as artists is we respond to complexity."
Nottage: "I see the artwork that we're making as a way to more deeply understand Michael Jackson and process feelings, and ultimately that's what theater can do."
I've long argued to young writers that critics should always be on the side of complexity and resist binary thinking, life being otherwise and human flaws and hidden agendas existing at every turn. Still, I've been wrestling mightily with whether I think these are fair arguments -- as distinct from rationalizations from otherwise progressive artists now in a difficult set of circumstances -- and whether it is even remotely possible for a musical featuring Michael Jackson songs to be, in Wheeldon's words, "a show that's balanced."
There are several thorny issues. One is that the permission, the dispensing of grand rights and much of the content of the artists' paychecks is coming from an estate that does not share this view, at least in public. Is it really going to allow any suggestion otherwise in the final product? There is no evidence that it will.
The second is that for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" to be a hit, it will have to rely on Jackson fans, and it will have to give them a good time. Many people now feel that it is inappropriate, given these allegations, to dance or sing along with music inherently tainted by biography. That is a very reasonable position.
Certainly, no jukebox show authorized by a living artist or an estate has ever dealt with anything quite like this. In Broadway biographies, peccadilloes and mistakes sometimes get a brief airing (as in "Summer, the Donna Summer Musical," involving the subject's controversial comments about gays), but they are quickly resolved. In an authorized voice. And then back to the dance party.
If the Jackson estate actually allows Nottage and Wheeldon to even hint at anything in "Leaving Neverland" in "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," that would make this the most remarkable jukebox musical in the history of Broadway.
On the other hand, what choice does the estate have?
From its point of view, cancellation would be far worse, putting a chill on the Jackson brand that might last for decades or forever. If they're smart, they'll let these two do what they feel they should.
And as for Nottage and Wheeldon, they're now under a moral obligation to at least partly sink their teeth into the hand that feeds them.

Take me out to the ... game of life?

Texto completo: I love God and country, my family and friends, my synagogue and my writing - and I also really love golf. Two bad knees and rehab after their replacements have put a crimp in my game, but I am slowly returning to the links. This is why Tiger Woods' victory at the Masters after more than a decade of physical and emotional challenges was so inspiring.
Every old guy was happy for him, and I am now officially an old guy.
My friend Tom Friedman, who writes the foreign affairs op-ed column for The New York Times, also loves golf with a true passion and was happy for Tiger. On April 15 he wrote a wonderful piece, "Tiger Woods and the Game of Life." Tom brought up my favorite philosophical/barroom/drinking debate, this deep and profound existential mystery: "What sport is most like life?"
So, dear readers, now it is your turn. This is your God Squad homework assignment for the week. Write to me and tell me which sport you think wins this debate, but please don't even try to suggest that the sport most like life is:
• Polo. Any sport which requires you to buy a horse is not like life.
• Hockey. There are no pads in life and not really that much ice, and though there is fighting in life, there is clearly much more fighting in hockey.
• Tennis, soccer, basketball. In these sports there is absolutely no chance that old slow people can win unless the only people playing are old slow people.
No, the way I see it, there are only really two candidates for the winner of the sport that is most like life. Friedman makes an excellent case for golf in his recent wonderful column. Here is a short excerpt:
"The biggest takeaway for me (of Tiger's victory) is the reminder of the truism that golf is the sport most like life, because it is played on an uneven surface and everything is on you. So good and bad bounces - and self-inflicted mistakes - are built into the game. And so much of success in golf, as in life, is about how you react to those good and bad bounces. Do you quit? Do you throw your club? Do you cheat? Do you whine? Do you blame your caddie?"
Well said. Golf is indeed a possible winner in the debate over which sport is most like life, and Tom has made an excellent case for it - and yet. I have another candidate that I think is the true winner: baseball.
Baseball is the game that is most like life because in baseball, as in life, mostly nothing happens.
Then, in baseball as in life, something unexpectedly happens and you have to be ready for it. If you are ready and you hit, catch or throw the ball properly you are a hero; but if you are not ready, you are the goat. Sometimes you never have an opportunity to redeem your mistakes. But sometimes (actually quite often) you do, but you just never know when your redemptive opportunity will come. You have to be ready all the time.
Baseball is also the perfect replica of life in that it is a perfect combination of individual effort and teamwork. The result of a baseball game depends partly on what you do alone and partly on what you do as a team. Baseball forms itself into teams, and teams bring in supporters who wear their colors and are brought together rooting for the team.
Even if the fans agree on nothing else in life, they agree on rooting for the team. Rooting for the same team binds them together with other fans. But the game is not just different teams, it is also about one game with the same rules for everybody (OK, this is the same in golf and the designated hitter does not fit here). It is the same in life. We have different religions and different countries, but we are all supposed to be fans of the same game with the same rules - the rules of justice and compassion, freedom and charity. Life is not always like that, but it should be, and it must be if we are all going to live together.
If you only get one hit out of three at-bats you are a hero, and that is about the same ratio of successful attempts at living a good life. You just have to be good enough sometimes to make your mark and be proud of how you played the game.
Q.E.D., or "Quod erat demonstrandum" - thus it has been proved. Baseball is the sport that is most like li

Texto completo: Perhaps the most obvious way to grow your business is to get more customers. And there are a handful of strategic ways to achieve this, whether those customers are consumers or other businesses. Kristin Wong
GET TO KNOW YOUR EXISTING CUSTOMER BETTER. "To understand what people really want, you have to find out what their real challenges are," said Ramit Sethi, the author of the New York Times best seller, "I Will Teach You to Be Rich" and founder of Growth Lab, a company that helps entrepreneurs build and grow online businesses. Figure out what made your current customers want to buy your product. This will help you pinpoint what you're doing right, and what marketing strategies might be a waste of time. If your company serves other businesses (known as B2B), ask about their business and revenue goals.
PINPOINT WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT. Many entrepreneurs find initial success copying a competitor's business model. If you want your business to grow however, you'll have to set it apart and find your unique brand identity.
BUILD A BIGGER ONLINE PRESENCE. Even if you don't have an online business, expanding your online brand presence is crucial to getting your product in front of more eyes, especially if your product sells directly to consumers.
POST CONTENT CONSISTENTLY. Whether you share content via a blog, newsletter or Twitter account, posting regularly will help your followers stay interested and engaged with your brand.
STAY TRUE TO YOUR BRAND IDENTITY. Whichever online platform you use to promote your business, make sure the content you post is consistent to your brand's identity.

Migrants Facing Toil and Trouble

Texto completo: No other filmmaker has been more immersed in the social upheavals of contemporary China than Wang Bing. Beginning with "Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks" (2003) a three-part, nine-hour look at the painful decline of a once-thriving industrial zone, the 52-year-old documentarian has consistently portrayed those dispossessed amid the changing landscape of his rapidly developing country.
Dislocation is Wang's great theme and the subject of "Bitter Money," his 2016 portrait of young rural migrants who leave their villages for low-paying jobs in the booming garment factories of Huzhou. (The film, along with five of his other documentaries, is available on the new OVID.tv subscription streaming service.)
Wang's camera wanders among the lives of the men and women who have flocked to the sewing factories. Sensation precedes explanation. Using no narration in his fly-on-the-wall vérité, Wang resembles the American documentarian Frederick Wiseman. But where Wiseman explores institutions, Wang focuses on individuals. He follows them -- into their workplaces and homes (often the same), recording their conversations and family relationships.
Wang spent two years filming "Bitter Money," maintaining that he shot 2,000 hours for this two-and-a-half-hour film. Working alone with a small digital video-camera customized with an autofocus lens, he seemingly blends into his subjects' lives. Because he edits less and holds shots longer than more conventional documentarians, his films are akin to Warhol screen tests -- full of revealing behavioral tics and transcendent empty moments. Wang's presence is not exactly invisible but only occasionally addressed. "Time to sleep -- you can film tomorrow," one man tells him. One wonders if the existence of China's extensive surveillance network has accustomed his subjects to this sort of attention.
"Bitter Money" begins with a 15-year-old girl and her older cousin leaving Yunnan Province in southwestern China to find work in Huzhou. The quarter-hour or so that Wang devoted to their days-long journey on a crowded train is a film in its own right -- a stolid pilgrimage into the future. The passengers seem to be in a state of suspended animation. Once in Huzhou, Wang finds other subjects at a workshop. In one sequence, he cuts from tailor to tailor, showing how the coats are made -- but he is mainly observational. Wang does not flinch from recording a domestic quarrel in which the husband has to be restrained from attacking his wife. He devotes considerable camera time to the despair of an older, obviously intoxicated worker fingering a pair of scissors and vaguely harassing a female colleague as he delivers a rambling diatribe against their unseen boss.
Working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, under unpleasant conditions, harsh lighting and intense time pressure, Wang's subjects are essentially free agents hired by small entrepreneurs to fulfill a particular quota. In his book "Adam Smith in Beijing," the sociologist Giovanni Arrighi describes these "hyper-exploited" young migrants as the "backbone of China's export industries." Given the monotony and deprivation of their lives, their economic uncertainty and the constant talk of money, the movie cannot be anything other than an indictment of China's so-called socialist market economy.
However local, "Bitter Money" is also universal. The spectacle of these men and women hunched over their sewing machines will not only resonate with those whose family histories include time working in a sweatshop, but anyone who reaps the benefit of inexpensive Chinese-manufactured clothing, which is to say, everyone.
"Bitter Money" ends with a contemplation of the migrants' alienated labor made material -- the workshop's output, bundled in plastic and forlornly waiting in the rain to be shipped overseas. That these products are intended for export reflects back on the movie. In a recent interview, Wang noted that because he refuses to submit his films for official approval, none have ever been shown commercially in China.
WANG'S DESIRE to wrest a story out of daily existence and to acknowledge the struggle of making a living makes him heir to the Italian neorealist filmmakers of the 1940s and '50s, including Giuseppe De Santis. His 1949 film "Bitter Rice," available for streaming on the new subscription Criterion channel, is a fascinating example of neorealist pulp. It also concerns migrant workers.
A story of the women, known as mondine, who harvest Italy's rice crop, "Bitter Rice" begins like a documentary with a radio reporter outside the Turin train station, urgently describing the mondine's annual migration to the rice paddies of the Po Valley. Their backbreaking work is amply acknowledged, but "Bitter Rice" is neorealism plus -- a crime melodrama encompassing instances of theft, sabotage, rape, childbirth, references to abortion and multiple violent deaths, including one by suicide. It also features abundant pulchritude. When the movie opened in the United States in late 1950, The Los Angeles Times called it "something like a Hollywood women's prison movie, only more so."
Following previous Italian hits "Open City" and "The Bicycle Thief" into the World Theater, a Times Square movie house specializing in imported films, "Bitter Rice" ran for months. The main attraction was the movie's statuesque, sultry star Silvana Mangano as a teenage rice harvester introduced executing a solo boogie-woogie. Impulsive and naïve, she comes under the spell of a swaggering thief played by Vittorio Gassman, soon himself to achieve international recognition.
"Bitter Rice" is an early example of globalist cinema. De Santis was a leftist whose sweeping panoramic shots of the hard-working and at times singing masses suggest Soviet celebrations of collective labor. He was also a fan of American movies; the two-fisted fight scenes are pure Hollywood. The movie's frank sexuality, however, struck Americans as distinctly European. "Passion toils and tumbles through it like the wrestlers in a gas-house free-for-all, and torments of carnal hunger are boldly and rawly exposed," the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote in his enthusiastic review.
This is undoubtedly why "Bitter Rice" -- which, according to Time magazine, would gross nearly $ 8 million in the United States -- was criticized by the American Legion as "a serious threat to Christian morality." Linked by William Mooring, the film critic for the Catholic journal Tidings, to the international Communist conspiracy, it was briefly banned in Albany, but also nominated for an Academy Award.

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS - Democratic presidential candidates called out iconic U.S. corporations such as McDonald's for underpaying workers, championed raising the federal minimum wage to $15, and pledged to roll back President Trump's tax cut during a forum on income inequality.
These issues have animated the restive Democratic base in the early stages of this nominating contest, and the candidates have responded: Nearly all have pledged their support for labor-friendly positions that would have put them on the far left just four years ago.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) flatly stated: "Corporations are going to have to pay more taxes."
Julián Castro, former housing secretary and San Antonio mayor, said that "housing should be a human right."
Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper floated increasing the minium wage "beyond $15" in some parts of the country.
Even Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), viewed as a moderate, bragged that pharmaceutical stocks would plummet if she were elected president because she would reduce the price of prescription drugs.
The forum, sponsored by the Service Employees International Union and the Center for American Progress Action Fund, attracted all of the top Democratic presidential candidates in 2008.
This time, two top contenders were missing. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who frequently takes credit for moving the party to the left, skipped to launch a series of house parties across the country. Former vice president Joe Biden, who entered the race Thursday and has supported laws that benefit large banks in the past, was also absent.
It was the first major multicandidate event held in Nevada, which will be the third state to vote in the Democratic nomination process. So far the state has garnered less attention than New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina.
The theme was fitting: Nearly 14 percent of Nevada workers are in unions, well above the U.S. average.
Organizers hoped the candidates would come armed with specifics, rather than offering platitudes about supporting unions. To help, the leaders of the nearly 2 million-member union put out a list of criteria that candidates must meet to secure its coveted endorsement, which included the willingness to call out specific companies by name.
Harris played ball, saying that as president she would be willing to call up the CEO of McDonald's and demand better wages. "You can't go around talking about the golden arches as a symbol of the best of America when you are not conducting yourself in the best way in terms of supporting the best of America," she said.
The forum's topic - and its focus on specifics - was tailor-made for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), an economic populist who received by far the warmest welcome from the crowd. "I've got a plan," the policy-heavy candidate said to hoots of support.
It gave her a venue to talk in detail about some of her big, but less flashy, proposals, including one that would let workers elect 40 percent of the members of large corporate boards. It's an idea reviled on Wall Street.
"Lets be blunt, people who have power don't give it up easily," she said. When she finished, Warren earned the event's only standing ovation.
Klobuchar used the forum to focus on a key theme of her candidacy: breaking up large companies. "What you do about this consolidated power - we have to do more with our antitrust laws," a line that was met by silence from the audience.
"I didn't expect a big applause line from that," Klobuchar added. "It sounds really boring."
Former congressman Beto O'Rourke, who has a more conservative record on economic issues such as banking regulations, agreed with most of the pro-union agenda. But he talked about it in a different way, arguing that an increase in the minimum wage would benefit the companies.
"Your productivity at work is going to be so much greater," O'Rourke said, when asked by moderator Steven Greenhouse, a former New York Times reporter, how he would persuade conservatives to support the idea.
When prompted to defend the pay increase to critics who say that minimum-wage jobs largely go to teenagers, O'Rourke displayed his signature charisma with an impassioned response that resonated with the audience.
"A $15 dollar minimum wage is not just for, as some would have us believe, that 16- or 17- or 18-year-old who might be working at a fast-food restaurant," O'Rourke said. "It might be for a 40- or 50- or 60-year-old who's working at a fast-food restaurant, who's working their second job."
Although Sanders didn't attend, he talked about some of the same economic issues Saturday, taking credit for moving them to the forefront of the Democratic primaries.
"The ideas that we are talking about - ideas that a few years ago, you may recall, sounded pretty radical," Sanders said, in a video broadcast live to the house parties. "When we talked about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour - you may recall that people thought we were nuts."

Texto completo: It's easy to see how "Born a Crime," Trevor Noah's funny and devastating memoir of growing up mixed race in South Africa, became a best seller. Less predictable was the success of the book's young readers' edition, published this month and aimed at children 8 and up. I asked the comedian and talk show host to talk about adapting his story for a much younger audience. These are excerpts from our conversation.
How did you arrive at the idea of a young readers' edition of "Born a Crime," given that your show is on way past this audience's bedtime?
It was a combination of factors, one of the most prevalent being that a lot of parents were saying their kids loved the book. People would say, I read the book to my 8-year-old, or my 10-year-old, but I wish they had a version they could read for themselves.
What changes did you make?
We slightly changed the framing of the book to gear it to a younger reader who doesn't know about the history of South Africa. And then the main difference is obviously we've changed the language a bit. It's not like the first book is graphic, but we made sure it's completely suitable for kids of all ages.
[Read more on how nonfiction writers adapt their books for young readers .]
There's that scene when you're 5 years old and you don't want to use the outhouse, so you put a piece of newspaper on the kitchen floor -- somehow it seems even funnier in the version for kids.
Changing the word to "poop" -- that small thing makes it more accessible. But everything else in the scene is basically the same. I didn't want the parents who'd liked the book to not get the same book for their kids.
I think the great stories connect with you regardless of your age. That's what Pixar and Disney do today -- they tell a story, and someone older can take away something different than a younger person does, but the heart of the story remains intact. The stories I loved as a kid are still the stories I love now.
Many people find it hard to figure out a way to talk to kids that's not condescending.
I found it to be a natural mind-set, maybe because I thought about telling these stories to my younger brother, who is 17. I speak to him like an adult. I was lucky to grow up in a household where my mother gave me respect and treated me like an adult. That's important to do with younger readers -- they may not have the experience, but they are still functioning human beings and they can grasp the concepts. When I was growing up, Roald Dahl had the biggest impact on me. The way he told a story was so simple, yet so complicated at the same time.
This edition also has to explain South Africa to American children, who generally don't know about apartheid. How did you approach that?
Unfortunately that's true, that American children don't learn about apartheid. But also, unfortunately, I could use a lot of American examples as reference points.
You mean like this one: "In America you had the forced removal of the native peoples onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid."
That passage is the same in both editions.
Did you worry that young readers wouldn't get some of the nuances in either the politics or your own story?
No -- again, that's the thing, when you look at kids, they understand things on different levels. Look at a child who's grown up in a harsh environment. I think they understand the nuances of their situation even more than most adults do. A kid will say, my daddy is not a good man when he's drinking alcohol, but I still love him. Grown-ups can't do that as easily. I think those sorts of ideas actually connect with kids better. As we grow older, we start holding on to our realities and our knowledge in a more entrenched way, as if it's who we are. It feels like, if I shake the core of what I know, maybe I'm not as intelligent as I thought I was. Kids don't struggle with it as much. They are not married to their ideas as much yet.
I think everybody understands a given story within their own context. I loved Dahl's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." I didn't really like many of the kids in the factory, but I also knew how to process the complications of their particular world. I thought, "this child was spoiled by his parents and that's why he is the way he is. I'm still sorry he had to fall into the chocolate." There are complicated ideas children can grasp if the storyteller relates to him in an authentic way. In Harry Potter, you don't ever think Voldemort is not bad, but you do come to understand how he came to be how he is, and why some people gravitate to him.
Have you been able to speak to groups of kids about the book yet?
I have, and it's been amazing. I guess I've never lost a lot of what I enjoyed about being a kid. Part of being a comedian and doing what I do is I try not to lose my imagination. I try to enjoy being silly, so when I hang out with kids and I tell the stories I tell, there's a beautiful space we exist within.
What do they find most interesting about the book?
A lot of kids are fascinated by apartheid itself. They ask, why didn't the government like black people? For a kid who hasn't yet internalized the workings of government, there's an illogic to apartheid that kids just don't understand.
We take for granted how a lot of the worst ideas are taught to children. We don't give children enough credit for understanding the difference between right and wrong. You have to really teach a child to understand something that is incorrect. You look at a little child raised in a racist place by parents who are racist. That child waves at a black person, and the parent says "You don't wave at them!" The child is just existing, he doesn't understand. Those small moments show you that you really have to be taught the wrong things that you know. Over time we allow life to erase some of the magic that made us who we were. It's a humbling experience to talk to kids about this book, because their questions remind me that as much as we'd like to forget it, we still are the kids we were growing up.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Joe Biden called Anita Hill this month to express his regret over "what she endured" testifying against Justice Clarence Thomas at the 1991 Supreme Court hearings that put a spotlight on sexual harassment of women, according to a spokeswoman for Biden.
But Hill, in an interview Wednesday, said she left the conversation feeling deeply unsatisfied and declined to characterize his words to her as an apology. She said she is not convinced that Biden truly accepts the harm he caused her and other women who suffered sexual harassment and gender violence.
"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I'm sorry for what happened to you. I will-be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose," she said.
She said she cannot support Biden, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 oversaw the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, until he takes responsibility for what he did and is also troubled by the recent accusations of improper touching.
"The focus on apology to me is one thing," she said. "But he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw. And not just women. There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence."
Biden's outreach to Hill, a law professor, was an attempt to defuse one of his most glaring vulnerabilities as he begins his presidential bid.
"They had a private discussion where he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country," said Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for Biden, who declared his presidential candidacy Thursday.
Biden has long cast the hearings in passive terms, as something that happened to Hill, not something he and others did to her. Hill has said in the past that Biden has never directly apologized for his actions.
Last month, at an event in New York honoring students who fight sexual violence, Biden acknowledged his role in a moment that remains seared in the minds of many women.
"She faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell this was all about," he said. "To this day, I regret I couldn't give her the kind of hearing she deserved. I wish I could have done something."

Can He Win? Answer May Be in 5 Questions

Texto completo: WILMINGTON, Del. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s entry Thursday into the sprawling Democratic primary has immediately reshaped the race, giving definition to a contest that has been defined mostly by uncertainty. Mr. Biden offers voters a household name, nearly a half-century of political experience and the implied promise of restoring the country to a less polarized, pre-Trump era.
But perhaps more than any other presidential front-runner in modern history, he begins his bid confronting deep skepticism from friend and foe alike that he can capture his party's nomination.
[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]
Here are five questions looming over Mr. Biden's candidacy, the answers to which could determine whether he becomes America's 46th president or concludes his career by losing his third bid for the White House.
How will he handle the onslaught?
Most casual voters, even in the primary, know Mr. Biden as President Barack Obama's vice president. But he was a senator from Delaware for 36 years before he entered the West Wing, and his record from a decidedly earlier day in Democratic politics is where his rivals for the nomination will focus their fire. He opposed busing to integrate schools, wrote a hard-line criminal justice bill and supported the Iraq War.
Most immediately, Mr. Biden will have to decide how to respond to new critical comments by Anita Hill, the law professor who in 1991 accused Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Mr. Biden recently called her, according to an aide, to express regrets that he did not do more for her when he presided over her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
But she told The New York Times that the call left her deeply unsatisfied, and that she did not consider it an apology. She said she is not convinced that Mr. Biden truly accepts the harm he caused her and other women.
It remains unclear what his broader strategy will be for handling scrutiny from the press and bombardments from his Democratic opponents along with a legion of left-wing critics who want to defeat his candidacy and ward off any return to a more moderate brand of liberalism.
Mr. Biden's supporters hope Mr. Obama offers him something of a halo. Many in Mr. Biden's orbit hope that rather than litigate every criticism about his Senate record, he restrains himself and focuses on his partnership with the country's first black president.
Can he stay above the fray?
The message from Mr. Biden's announcement video was urgent and unmistakable: President Trump's tenure amounts to a national emergency and defeating him is essential to America's survival. Framing the campaign this way does not just make 2020 a referendum on the president, it also offers Mr. Biden a rationale for why Democrats should put forward a septuagenarian in the winter of his political life. This is not, he is arguing, yet another nomination clash in one more presidential campaign.
[Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.]
But so far, it has sure seemed that way. Even the candidates who believe that Mr. Trump should be impeached are not eager to discuss the president or why he should be removed from office. The race has mostly focused on their policy ideas, biographies and how to accommodate a party drifting left. Before Mr. Biden's announcement, the campaign was animated this week by a debate over whether prisoners should be allowed to vote.
Many Democratic strategists believe that Mr. Biden should resist tangling with his intraparty rivals and avoid the temptation to prove that he is just as progressive as they are. "Don't let the agenda stray from the argument that he can deliver us from Trump," said Paul Begala, the former Bill Clinton adviser.
But when Mr. Biden appears before reporters and voters upon arriving in Iowa next week, that may prove easier said than done. Never known for his discipline, the former vice president is entering a media environment unlike that in his first two presidential campaigns; now his every misstep will immediately pinball across the internet. And he is stepping into a race filled with 19 other candidates who could lift their profiles by baiting the front-runner into a back-and-forth that would quickly erase memories of Mr. Biden's high-minded call to arms.
What's an 'Obama-Biden Democrat'?
Mr. Biden this month played down his party's leftward turn, pointing out the success of moderates in last year's midterm elections and telling reporters he was a proud "Obama-Biden Democrat." But less clear is what exactly that means in 2019.
Mr. Biden has not sketched out any vision on health care, criminal justice, education or the environment. He has said he has the most progressive record of any candidate, but then amended that to indicate he was alluding to his stances on social issues like L.G.B.T. rights.
[Here's a look at what Mr. Biden has said about some key issues.]
Mr. Biden may be too tenuous a front-runner to alienate any of his party's core constituencies, but he could risk just as much by portraying himself as anything besides a mainstream liberal. He faces few more important tasks than finding that balance: reflecting the party for what it is today without attempting a cringe-inducing reinvention of what he likes to call his "brand."
Does he have ideas for the future?
Mr. Biden's announcement video was about one big promise to voters: He would eject Mr. Trump from office and lead a country that they could be proud of. Asked by a reporter outside a pizzeria in Wilmington, Del., on Thursday afternoon about his message for the rest of the world, he said "America is coming back" and said his administration would be "ethical, straight, telling the truth."
But the traditional American values Mr. Biden extolled may only go so far in inspiring voters, both in a primary and a general election. Some of his Democratic competitors already have well-developed signature proposals that have helped to define their candidacies, like Senator Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All Act, Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan to forgive student loans and Senator Cory Booker's "baby bonds" program. Mr. Biden has nothing comparable, at least so far.
Mr. Biden may start to fill in this blank space on Monday, when he is to visit a Pittsburgh union hall and speak about the middle class and the economy. But it is unclear whether he will be inclined to develop sweeping policy plans, or whether he will stay close to his roots as a moderate who favors political compromise and incremental change.
The risk to Mr. Biden, if he takes too long to define his vision for the future, is that he might come to be seen mainly as a figure of nostalgia -- a candidate of the past.
Can he raise money, without being defined by it?
So far, the most important fund-raising in the Democratic race has happened online. And several of the most prominent candidates, including Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, are fueling their campaigns almost exclusively that way.
Mr. Biden's approach will be different, and far more reliant on the largess of the wealthiest benefactors of the Democratic Party. His aides have already spent more than a week encouraging donors to send $ 2,800 checks -- the maximum sum allowed -- to his primary-campaign-in-waiting, and a Comcast executive who oversees the company's lobbying division was hosting a major fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in Philadelphia on Thursday night.
The financial challenges for Mr. Biden are twofold. He must raise an immense amount of money rapidly, without the benefit of a robust online fund-raising machine of the kind some of his rivals possess. And Mr. Biden must raise that amount without stoking suspicions among Democratic primary voters that he is compromised by his dependency on big money.
[Mr. Biden started his campaign with $ 0, when other candidates had already collected millions.]
The latter danger -- that "Middle-Class Joe," as he styles himself, could come to be seen as a candidate of rich people and corporations -- may be especially vexing to Mr. Biden because his record on banking and corporate regulation has already drawn sharp criticism from the left. Yet, without having spent years cultivating an online donor base, and lacking the novelty factor that has helped other candidates soak the internet, Mr. Biden appears to see little alternative to seeking out the biggest checks possible.

Texto completo: The multitalented Jeff Goldblum returns to Honolulu this weekend, but don’t worry, there won’t be any dinosaurs on his trail.
The quirky actor and star of three “Jurassic Park” films will be at Blue Note Hawaii playing jazz piano with his combo, The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra, for two nights.
Goldblum’s piano playing has been an open secret for decades, but it recently emerged into the limelight after he and his band released an album, “The Capitol Studios Sessions,” in November. The live album, which featured singing sensations Imelda May and Haley Reinhart, comedian Sarah Silverman and Grammy-winning trumpeter Till Bronner, along with Goldblum at his wise-cracking best, promptly went to No. 1 on the Billboard Jazz Charts, and stayed in the top 10 for eight weeks.
“One of the many impressive aspects of ‘The Capitol Studio Sessions’ is just how balanced Goldblum’s skills are as he deftly moves his audience from perky vocal standards to swinging instrumental numbers — each transition aided, of course, with some very charming stage banter,” said critic Matt Collar at the music website Allmusic.com.
Goldblum, now 66, started taking piano lessons as a youngster, at first without much dedication. After his teacher gave him tunes like “Alley Cat” and “Stairway to the Stars” — “with some interesting harmonies, chords, that were not in the exercises that I’d been doing,” he become more focused, he told the New York Times.
His interest in jazz grew after hearing his father’s Errol Garner albums, and by age 14, he was playing professionally in his hometown of Pittsburg, getting gigs in a way that seems positively Goldblumian for its audacity and nerve – cold-calling nightclub managers and telling them he knew they were “looking for someone” to perform on their piano.
“Most of them would say, ‘No, we don’t even have a piano here. I don’t know what you’re talking about,’” he told Rolling Stone Magazine, “But some would say, ‘Yeah, we have a piano. Where’d you hear that?’ I’d make up something and get, ‘Come on down and play it, let’s see what you do,’ and I got a couple of jobs that way.”
Goldblum went to New York at age 17 to pursue his dreams in acting, but he continued playing the piano, not as a career ambition but as something he loved to do. After he landed a role with fellow actor and musician Peter Weller, a trumpeter, in “The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension,” they started playing music together and formed an impromptu band.
Goldblum then had a role in Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall.” His character had a single, classic line, “I’ve lost my mantra,” but Goldblum received some good musical advice from Allen, who is an accomplished clarinetist and was known to pop into New York clubs to play jazz. He told Goldblum to do the same, and since the 1990s, Goldblum and his band have had a standing gig to play Wednesdays at Rockwell Table & Stage, an L.A. nightclub.
They’ve also played jazz festivals around the world and fit in tours when Goldblum isn’t working on a film. He’s also known to sit down casually at a piano in a hotel lobby or train station and entertain bypassers with a song, a joke and a smile.
With mannerisms both edgy yet disarming, and a rapid-fire, yet casual style of line delivery, Goldblum has carved out a unique path in cinema, with roles as a chaos theory expert in the “Jurassic Park” films, a macho, alien-fighting computer geek in two “Independence Day” films and a manipulative grandmaster in “Thor: Ragnarok.”
Between acting gigs, and when possible, Goldblum begins his day with a session at the keyboard, and to this day, it obviously still tickles him just to play the instrument.
“I’m a late bloomer, and I feel like I’m getting better at things all the time,” he told Conan O’Brien recently. “I’m nothing if not disciplined, and I went through my piano workout today, and I say I did better than ever.”
His band performs classic standards – “The Capitol Sessions” features songs like Herbie Hancock’s rolling “Cantaloupe Island,” the Marvin Gaye composition, “Don’t Mess With Mister T” and the cutesy Al Jolson hit “Me And My Shadow.”
The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra, named after a family friend in Pittsburg (Goldblum merely thought it was a funny-sounding name), consists of John Storie on guitar, James King on saxophone, Alex Frank on bass, Joe Bagg on organ and Kenny Elliott on drums. Vocalist Gina Saputo will be performing with them at Blue Note Hawaii.

Why Lizzo? Cuz we all love her right now.

Texto completo: Even if you've never heard of Lizzo, you've probably at least heard Lizzo .
Around this time last year, the singer, who also raps and plays the flute (we'll get back to that in a minute), established a ubiquitous presence in commercials and TV/movie trailers. Listen to her music, and it's easy to see why - her songs are catchy and self-assured, blending thumping bass and gospel riffs into infectious tracks that are undeniably hers. The Detroit native, who grew up in Houston, has described her music as "church with a twerk."
Lizzo, born Melissa Viviane Jefferson, has been an underground sensation for years. She performed in indie hip-hop groups before releasing her debut album, "Lizzobangers," in 2013, followed by another indie release and several EPs. But she's courting mainstream success with her latest album, "Cuz I Love You," released Friday on Atlantic, a showstopping Coachella run and an ever-expanding catalogue of songs that speak perfectly to everything from a Netflix rom-com to a line of sparkling cocktails.
Lizzo is, as they say, having a moment. She just announced a second leg of her tour, dubbed "Cuz I Love You Too," to support her major-label debut. (She will play a sold-out show at Washington's 9:30 Club next month and will return in September for a stop at the Anthem.)
Lizzo's songs feel like instant song-of-the-summer contenders. Her confidence is contagious. "If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine," she declares on "Juice," the joyful lead single on "Cuz I Love You." In "Tempo," a club banger featuring Missy Elliott, Lizzo asserts that slow songs aren't worthy of her curves. "Can't move all of this here to one of those," she purrs.
Her lyrics are often playful, but that doesn't mean she lacks musical chops. She's been playing the flute since she was 10 and has worked the classical instrument into her music and stage presence. She's a band geek at heart, having played in marching bands from middle school to the University of Houston, where she majored in classical flute performance.
"Juice" delightfully gave way to a parody of "Anchorman's" legendary jazz flute scene.
Many of the songs that have popped into our collective atmosphere predate "Cuz I Love You." Lizzo lends her 2017 breakup single "Truth Hurts," to a memorable scene in Netflix's new rom-com "Someone Great," starring "Jane the Virgin's" Gina Rodriguez.
Lizzo's 2016 extended play, "Coconut Oil," spawned at least two songs that went into heavy rotation. Her self-love anthem, "Good as Hell," first featured in "Barbershop: The Next Cut," was later heard in "A Bad Moms Christmas" and "I Feel Pretty." A few months ago, Weight Watchers featured the soulful "Worship" in a campaign announcing the brand's revamp as WW. (Cadillac has also used the song.)
Lizzo, who has been a champion of body positivity, drew some flak for the Weight Watchers ad. ("I made a commitment to feel-good music. I had to show my belly a lot of attention, a lot of love," she told the New York Times last year.) Some fans were irked to hear Lizzo's music being used to promote a brand built around dieting. She addressed the backlash in candid Instagram Live videos and recently called it "a learning experience."
Lizzo's body is the centerpiece of her new album's cover, which features the singer nude, her long black hair cascading down her back. In a recent video, posted to her social media accounts, she smooches a cake version of herself in the stripped-down pose.
She has been open about the times she wasn't so confident. Her father died in 2010, throwing the singer, then 21, into a deep depression. He had been her music's biggest champion, and his death almost led her to quit. "I was like, 'I have no reason to do this anymore because I was doing it for him,' " Lizzo recently told Trevor Noah. "But then I realized I have to do this for myself, because he was doing it for me."
Lizzo says she is also doing it for her fans. "I can't wake up one day and not be black. I can't wake up one day and not be a woman. I can't wake up one day and not be fat," she said in a Teen Vogue interview last year. "I always had those three things against me in this world, and because I fight for myself, I have to fight for everyone else."
And she remains determined to share her music - and message - with the world. Over the weekend, as her Coachella set suffered from ongoing technical issues, she took matters into her own hands, performing "Juice" a cappella.
At one point, she reached for her flute. "If they ain't gonna get the music right, I'm gonna get the music right," she reportedly told the crowd.

Mick Mulvaney told Kirstjen Nielsen: Don't bring up 2020 Russian election interference to Trump

Texto completo: White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney reportedly told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen not to bring up Russian interference in future elections with President Trump.

Nielsen wanted the White House to focus on preparing for potential Russian interference in the 2020 election, but Mulvaney told her the president “still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory,” the New York Times reported Wednesday.

The topic “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below [the president’s] level,” Mulvaney said.

Nielsen, who was forced to resign earlier this month, eventually stopped trying to gather Cabinet secretaries at the White House to put together a plan on how to protect the 2020 elections.

The report comes a day after Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner said the effects of Russian interference in the 2016 election was exaggerated. The U.S. intelligence community believes the Russians meddled in an effort to help Trump win the election.

“You look at what Russia did — you know, buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent and do it — and it’s a terrible thing,” Kushner said at the Time 100 Summit on Tuesday.

“But I think the investigations, and all of the speculation that’s happened for the last two years, has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads,” he said.

Former vice president Biden expected to run

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to announce his candidacy for president on Thursday, bringing months of speculation to an end.
Both the New York Times and the Associated Press reported Tuesday that Biden will announce his candidacy in a video to be released Thursday.
Biden, 76, is then scheduled to speak in Pittsburgh on Monday.
For months, Biden has dropped hints about running for president, including when he told Delaware Democrats in March that he has the "most progressive record of anybody running."
This will be Biden's third attempt at a presidential run.
Although he's favored in some polls and is seen as the front-runner for the Democratic primary, Biden has faced criticism in recent weeks over his behavior and stances on certain issues.
In late March, Lucy Flores, a former Democratic Nevada assemblywoman wrote in an article published in the Cut that Biden made her uncomfortable when he put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair and gave her a "big slow kiss" on the back of her head at a political rally in 2014.
Flores' claim prompted inspection of Biden's past, including media analyses of previously published photos showing Biden interacting with women. Three more women have since spoken publicly about how Biden's behavior made them feel uncomfortable.
Others quickly came to his defense. It prompted Biden to release a video on social media in which he said that he will be more "mindful and respectful of people's personal space" following allegations from women that his behavior has made them uncomfortable.
In recent weeks, the Biden campaign has made calls to prominent Democratic donors, the New York Times reported.
The country's largest firefighters union is planning to endorse the former vice president, according to AP.

Texto completo: Una vez más el presidente Donald Trump se vuelca a Twitter para arremeter contra sus críticos, esta vez haciendo una inusual exigencia.
Trump atacó al premio Nobel de economía, Paul Krugman y columnista del New York Times acusándolo de estar “obsesionado con el odio” de su administración.
En un par de tweets, Trump arremitió contra Krugman por lo que llamó “escritos falsos y altamente inexactos” después de la columna más reciente de Krugman, que dice que los republicanos ya no apoyan los valores estadounidenses.
“Paul Krugman, de Fake News New York Times, ha perdido toda credibilidad, al igual que el propio Times, con sus escritos falsos y altamente inexactos sobre mí”, escribió Trump. “Está obsesionado con el odio, al igual que otros están obsesionados con lo estúpido que es. Dijo que el mercado se estrellaría, ¡Sólo los máximos históricos!”
“Me pregunto si el New York Times se disculpará conmigo por segunda vez, como lo hicieron después de las elecciones de 2016”, continuó Trump. “Pero este tendrá que ser una disculpa mucho más grande y mejor. En este caso, tendrán que arrodillarse y pedir perdón, ¡son verdaderamente el Enemigo del Pueblo!”
Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
Tras revisar el reporte de Robert Mueller, Krugman acusó a presidente y su campaña de “recibier con agrado” la asistencia rusa durante las elecciones de 2016, una referencia a los hallazgos del informe que determinó que los agentes rusos interfirieron en las elecciones de 2016 con la intención de apoyar la candidatura de Trump.
“Una potencia extranjera hostil intervino en las elecciones presidenciales, con la esperanza de instalar a Donald Trump en la Casa Blanca. La campaña de Trump fue consciente de esta intervención y la acogió. Y una vez en el poder, Trump intentó bloquear cualquier investigación sobre lo que sucedió”, Krugman. escribió.

Texto completo: Se conocen más detalles sobre Larry Hopkins , el líder de los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos, la milicia pro Trump que detuvo con armas de fuego a un grupo de 300 inmigrantes en la frontera sur.
El líder de la milicia de extrema derecha, capturado por el FBI dos días después de que el grupo publicó el video de la captura de los inmigrantes, presumió hace dos años que los miembros de su grupo habían recibido capacitación para asesinar a figuras como el ex presidente Obama.
Los documentos judiciales conocidos por Reuters dijeron que si bien se había estado investigando las denuncias de “actividad de la milicia extremista” en 2017, los testigos acusaron a Hopkins de decir que su grupo planeaba asesinar no solo a Obama, sino al candidato presidencial demócrata de 2016, Hillary Clinton y George Soros, un rico partidario de los liberales.
Hopkins ahora enfrenta cargos criminales por posesión de armas de fuego.
Reuters informó que el agente especial del FBI, David Gabriel, había descubierto una charla sobre dichos asesinatos en octubre de 2017, cuando estaba investigando informes de que una milicia operaba desde la casa de Hopkins en Nuevo México.
“Hopkins supuestamente también hizo la declaración de que los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos se estaban entrenando para asesinar a George Soros, Hillary Clinton y Barack Obama “, según el reporte de Reuters.
El informe señala que el grupo ha afirmado haber ayudado a los funcionarios de La Migra a detener a 5,600 migrantes en el desierto de Nuevo México en los últimos 60 días.
Por su parte Carlos A. Díaz, un portavoz de la Patrulla Fronteriza, le dijo a The New York Times que la agencia federal “no respalda a los grupos privados u organizaciones que toman los asuntos de aplicación en sus propias manos”.

Texto completo: A former New Canaan resident and Yale University grad was one of six people killed in a plane crash Monday in Texas.
Angela “Angie” Webb Kensinger, 54, and her husband, Stuart Roben Kensinger, 55, were killed when a twin-engine Beechcraft BE58 went down while approaching Kerrville Municipal Airport, about 70 miles northwest of San Antonio around 9 a.m. central time, The Houston Chronicle reported.
Angela Webb Kensinger, a 1979 New Canaan Country School grad, was the girls varsity lacrosse coach at St. John’s School, a private K-12 school in Houston.
According to a 1989 New York Times wedding announcement, Kensinger was the daughter of William J. Gaynor Webb of New Canaan. After attending New Canaan Country School, she graduated from Hotchkiss School and Yale University.
In addition to the Kensingers, the victims were identified as Jeffrey C. Weiss, 65, a senior vice president for investments at Raymond James and Associates in Houston, who was the owner and pilot of the aircraft; 58-year-old Mark Damien Scioneaux, 55-year-old Scott Reagan Miller and 45-year-old Marc Tellepsen, all of Houston.
Weiss owned the plane with his friend and fellow pilot Charles Morina, who told The Houston Chronicle that Weiss loved to fly and the pair volunteered transporting sick people from remote regions to Texas hospitals for Angel Flight. Marina told the Associated Press the plane was well maintained.
Tellepsen’s family told KTRK-TV in Houston that he and Scioneaux were on a trip scouting property when the crash occurred

Texto completo: After opening up about the "unhealthy dynamic" in her seven-year marriage to singer/songwriter Ryan Adams, Mandy Moore is making one thing clear: She's put her painful relationship past behind her.
Moore told Michigan Avenue Magazine she "was not apprehensive at all" to start a relationship with Dawes lead singer Taylor Goldsmith after her 2016 split from Adams.
“It was inevitable – it was always what was going to happen,” she said of her romance with Goldsmith. “I was like, ‘Oh, this is what it’s supposed to be like. This is how life is supposed to unfold. ’”
Moore and Goldsmith went public with their relationship soon after she finalized her divorce. They got married on November 18, 2018.
In February, the "This Is Us" actress spoke out in a New York Times article the detailed allegations of harassment against Adams. Moore told The Times that Adams used music as a "point of control" as she was trying to make strides in the industry.
Moore always knew she would find love, she told Michigan Avenue Magazine.
"I knew that past situations didn’t define me and didn’t even define what love or marriage or relationships or any of that had to be," she said. "My experiences in the past were singular to that. I knew, even before I met Taylor, I would love again, and I would get married again, and I would have a family. And all the things I always hoped for and wanted, I still believed were out there and possible. "
She continued: "Not to say that I didn’t have my own grief and pain and trauma to tend to, deal with, overcome and heal from, but it never affected how I feel about love. ”
Following the New York Times article in February, Moore elaborated to Marc Maron she felt like she was "drowning" in her relationship with Adams and had "no sense of self. "
“I was living my life for him," she said on Maron's WTF podcast. “I felt like I was drowning. It was so untenable and unsustainable and it was so lonely. I was so sad. I was lonely with him. ”
Moore also said she passed on bigger acting jobs while married to Adams, fearing the way he would react if she was gone from home for too long.
“I would do little jobs. It’s not like I completely stopped working. I would do things here or there, but it became abundantly clear while I was working, things would completely fall apart at home,” she said. “I couldn’t do my job because there was just a constant stream of trying to pay attention to this person who needed me and wouldn’t let me do anything else. ”

Trump conspiracy theories continue

Texto completo: "Donald Trump broke the brains of a lot of people." That's leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald, talking about the way conspiracy theories have occupied the media despite the absence of any actual evidence.
For over two years, the line among mainstream media, from The New York Times to Rachel Maddow, has been that President Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's stooge. It was suggested that the Russians "hacked" the election by penetrating voting machines. When that was exploded, we were told that they "hacked" the election by arranging for Wikileaks to release (truthful) emails about how the Democratic Party rigged its primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton to ensure that Bernie Sanders wouldn't get the nomination. At some point, the narrative shifted to vaguer references to "collusion."
It was all bogus. As Greenwald notes, Mueller's report didn't just reject the Trump-Russia conspiracy theories, it obliterated them. Not only was no one in Trump's campaign charged with conspiring with the Russians, no American anywhere was so charged, nor did Mueller find evidence along those lines to support criminal charges.
That should put the whole collusion narrative to bed, but of course it hasn't. After two years of what can fairly be described as mass hysteria afflicting a huge portion of our political class, the cognitive dissonance is painful. It would be amusing to watch, if the "broken brains" weren't so widespread among the people who are supposed to be the sober managers and reporters of our society. It's like a doomsday cult whose predicted apocalypse fails to appear on schedule: They just announce that they made a mathematical mistake, and doomsday will actually come next year. Then they ask for more donations. The trouble is, this time it's a cult that's running a significant part of our nation.
Even post-Mueller, the hysteria continues. Ralph Peters, on CNN, referred to President Trump as "slavishly subordinate" to Vladimir Putin. But that's crazy. Trump has sanctioned Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Syria, and Iran, under his command the United States military killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria, has been sending weapons to Ukraine to resist Russian invasion, and most importantly has promoted U.S. oil production, crushing Russia's main source of money and influence.
As Walter Russell Mead wrote in 2017, if Trump were the Manchurian candidate that people keep wanting to believe that he is, here are some of the things he'd be doing:
Limiting fracking as much as he possibly could
Blocking oil and gas pipelines
Opening negotiations for major nuclear arms reductions
Cutting U.S. military spending
Trying to tamp down tensions with Russia's ally Iran
That Trump is planning to do precisely the opposite of these things may or may not be good policy for the United States, but anybody who thinks this is a Russia appeasement policy has been drinking way too much joy juice.
Obama actually did all of these things, and none of the liberal media now up in arms about Trump ever called Obama a Russian puppet; instead, they preferred to see a brave, farsighted and courageous statesman.
Back when Mitt Romney warned of Russian influence in 2012, Democrats – including the New York Times' Maggie Haberman – were quick to mock him. She's suddenly repented of her Romney mocking, now that Romney, instead of being a Republican candidate for president, is a Trump critic. Broken brain, indeed.
One of the great legacies of the Trump Administration is the extent to which it has revealed that huge swathes of our national establishment, in government, the media, and elsewhere, are both hopelessly partisan and frighteningly incompetent. Buckle up, because all the evidence is that the establishment hasn't learned its lesson yet.

Texto completo: “Donald Trump broke the brains of a lot of people. ” That’s leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald, talking about the way conspiracy theories have occupied the media despite the absence of any actual evidence.
For over two years, the line among mainstream media, from The New York Times to Rachel Maddow, has been that President Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin’s stooge. It was suggested that the Russians “hacked” the election by penetrating voting machines. When that was exploded, we were told that they “hacked” the election by arranging for Wikileaks to release (truthful) emails about how the Democratic Party rigged its primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton to ensure that Bernie Sanders wouldn’t get the nomination. At some point, the narrative shifted to vaguer references to “collusion. ”
It was all bogus. As Greenwald notes, Mueller’s report didn’t just reject the Trump-Russia conspiracy theories, it obliterated them. Not only was no one in Trump’s campaign charged with conspiring with the Russians, no American anywhere was so charged, nor did Mueller find evidence along those lines to support criminal charges.
Read more commentary:
Mueller report takeaways: Trump didn't collude but Obama blew it bigtime on Russia
Mueller report warning: Russia won in 2016 by making Americans question our democracy
Mueller report: Findings prove Donald Trump never colluded with Russia, obstructed justice
That should put the whole collusion narrative to bed, but of course it hasn’t. After two years of what can fairly be described as mass hysteria afflicting a huge portion of our political class, the cognitive dissonance is painful. It would be amusing to watch, if the “broken brains” weren’t so widespread among the people who are supposed to be the sober managers and reporters of our society. It’s like a doomsday cult whose predicted apocalypse fails to appear on schedule: They just announce that they made a mathematical mistake, and doomsday will actually come next year. Then they ask for more donations. The trouble is, this time it’s a cult that’s running a significant part of our nation.
Trump is not subordinate to Russia
Even post-Mueller, the hysteria continues. Ralph Peters, on CNN, referred to President Trump as "slavishly subordinate” to Vladimir Putin. But that’s crazy. Trump has sanctioned Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Syria, and Iran, under his command the United States military killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria, has been sending weapons to Ukraine to resist Russian invasion, and most importantly has promoted U. S. oil production, crushing Russia’s main source of money and influence.
As Walter Russell Mead wrote in 2017:
If Trump were the Manchurian candidate that people keep wanting to believe that he is, here are some of the things he’d be doing:
► Limiting fracking as much as he possibly could
► Blocking oil and gas pipelines
► Opening negotiations for major nuclear arms reductions
► Cutting U. S. military spending
► Trying to tamp down tensions with Russia’s ally Iran
That Trump is planning to do precisely the opposite of these things may or may not be good policy for the United States, but anybody who thinks this is a Russia appeasement policy has been drinking way too much joy juice.
Obama actually did all of these things, and none of the liberal media now up in arms about Trump ever called Obama a Russian puppet; instead, they preferred to see a brave, farsighted and courageous statesman.
Back when Mitt Romney warned of Russian influence in 2012, Democrats — including the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman — were quick to mock him. She’s suddenly repented of her Romney mocking, now that Romney, instead of being a Republican candidate for president, is a Trump critic. Broken brain, indeed.
One of the great legacies of the Trump Administration is the extent to which it has revealed that huge swathes of our national establishment, in government, the media, and elsewhere, are both hopelessly partisan and frighteningly incompetent. Buckle up, because all the evidence is that the establishment hasn’t learned its lesson yet.

The bodies in the brush
By Manny Fernandez in Falfurrias, Tex.
Last week, President Trump told reporters during his visit to San Antonio that he was shocked to learn that migrants were dying in the South Texas brush after crossing the border illegally.
"I had no idea," Mr. Trump said. "Nobody has any idea how bad this is." He added, "Many, many are dying. That was what surprised me."
The president spoke at a private club last Wednesday at 12:56 p.m. At that very moment, 186 miles to the south, Deputy Bianca Mora with the Brooks County Sheriff's Office was driving a patrol truck on a caliche road. She was responding to a report of a migrant body on a ranch. It was her second body of the day.
"I don't know how to explain it but you get used to it," said Deputy Mora, 25. "I went to one last year and I didn't have enough body bags. I wasn't prepared for the amount of bodies that we found. I went initially for one. We picked up three."
Brooks County is deep in South Texas brush country: an immense swath of ranchlands thick with thorny shrubs, cactus and mesquite and oak trees. The county seat, Falfurrias, has a population of 4,981. One ranch alone is 8,600 acres -- more than 10 times the size of Central Park. Brooks County is far north of the border -- about an hour's drive -- but it is home to a busy Border Patrol traffic checkpoint.
[Read more about those checkpoints here.]
Migrants, led by smugglers known as coyotes, try to hike around the checkpoint. Ill-prepared for the days-long journey in the harsh brush, sometimes without adequate water or food, hundreds of migrants have died on the private ranches in Brooks County in recent years, making it one of the deadliest places on America's southwest border.
Since January 2009, the bodies or skeletal remains of 642 migrants have been discovered in Brooks County. They die from the cold in the winter and die from the heat in the summer. They die of dehydration, heat stroke, hypothermia. They die alone. Sometimes they die together, like the five migrants whose bodies were found under a tree during a freeze one winter. Eight bodies have been found so far this year. Fifty were recovered in 2018 by the sheriff's office, down from 52 in 2017 and 61 in 2016.
Those 642 bodies are but a fraction of the border-wide total. From October 1997 to September 2018, the Border Patrol recorded 7,505 migrant deaths in its nine sectors along the entire southwestern border. The actual number of border deaths is likely higher, because the Border Patrol figure includes only cases reported to the authorities-- no one knows how many were never found.
The sheriff of Brooks County, Urbino "Benny" Martinez, said he was not all that surprised that some people were unaware of what has been happening in his county, including the president of the United States.
"It's kind of that old thing -- out of sight, out of mind, and if it's not happening in your backyard, you're not going to pay attention to it," Sheriff Martinez said.
On the day the president spoke, the first call came in to the sheriff's office shortly before 10 a.m., a few hours into Deputy Mora's 12-hour shift. Border Patrol agents had called it in -- the body of a woman, near a barbed wire fence in the back corner of a ranch. Her skeleton was face down. She was carrying cash from Honduras, Mexico and the United States. Prayer cards were found in the dirt around her, and in the pockets of her jeans.
"The Border Patrol agents were following a group of illegals northbound, towards the highway, and the group crossed over the body and just kept going," Deputy Mora said. "The agents came across it and called it out."
Deputy Mora was back in the office, writing up her report, when the second call came in shortly before noon. A worker had found the body of a man at another ranch. The man was lying face up, his arms extended out, on a sandy road known as a drag. A Honduran ID card was in his black wallet.
Dr. Corinne E. Stern, who is the chief medical examiner of Laredo's Webb County and who conducts autopsies for Brooks County, said both bodies had not yet been positively identified. The woman was possibly a Honduran missing person. The man was likely the Honduran on the ID, Dr. Stern said.
"The most likely cause of death is dehydration," Dr. Stern said of both bodies.
Relatives in Honduras said they believed the man who was found last week was indeed the person on the ID card: Rudy Donaldo Martinez Arias, 21, a husband and father who lived in the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. Relatives said they were told Mr. Martinez had died of thirst in South Texas after the coyote abandoned him and other migrants.
"He left our country, Honduras, because the salaries are not enough here," Maricela Amador, 24, Mr. Martinez's cousin, said in an interview using Facebook messages. "It is pure poverty. That's why people migrate to the United States without knowing what awaits them. He wanted to leave to find a good job where he could provide for his family."
Mr. Martinez's daughter is 3 years old. In January, he posted a selfie of the two of them on his Facebook page. A relative posted a comment, remarking how beautiful the girl looked.
"Yes, that's right," Mr. Martinez wrote in Spanish. "She's the most beautiful, my princess."

What to read: Books about the border
By Concepción de León, New York Times books department
I write a column in which I recommend books for readers who want to better understand a topic in the news -- climate change, immigration or the economy, for instance. To pick the books, I try to understand the questions my selections should answer. In this case: How do we understand life at the border? What happens to those who try to cross it? Is it as dangerous as some fear?
These five books offer some answers to these questions, but they stand out because they also complicate and deepen our understanding of the stretch of land where Mexico and the United States meet, and the people who live there.
LOST CHILDREN ARCHIVE, by Valeria Luiselli (2019)
This road-trip novel follows two parents and their children on what may be their last trip together. They travel from east to west, each parent's mind set on a different destination. For the mother, it is the border. She is haunted by the news of the unaccompanied minors crossing into the United States alone, and their journey looms throughout the book. Our reviewer wrote: "The novel truly becomes novel again in her hands -- electric, elastic, alluring, new. And the story of the migrant, she believes, insists upon a new form: How else to tell a story that has no end?" Read the full New York Times review here.
UNACCOMPANIED, by Javier Zamora (2017)
Mr. Zamora, who was born in El Salvador, crossed the border alone at 9 to reunite with his parents in the United States. In this collection of poems, he mines his memories of crossing, remembers the country he left behind and imagines his parents' journeys. Mr. Zamora wrote an essay about his experience for the opinion section last fall.
RETABLOS: Stories From a Life Lived Along the Border, by Octavio Solis (2018)
This memoir is told in a series of vignettes that focus on singular episodes formative to the writer's identity. It's modeled after the Mexican tradition of retablo painting, folk art that depicts life-altering stories visually on pieces of repurposed metal. Mr. Solis, who grew up just a mile from the Rio Grande in El Paso, writes about experiences such as being ridiculed for mispronouncing an English word in class or once finding a Mexican girl hiding in a cotton field.
THE LINE BECOMES A RIVER: Dispatches From the Border, by Francisco Cantú (2018)
Tired of reading about the border secondhand, Mr. Cantú decided to join the Border Patrol. This book covers his four years working as an agent in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Though the agents are primed for drug cartels, they more often encounter their victims: "bewildered, disoriented, helpless migrants," our reviewer wrote. When it was released last year, Mr. Cantú's book drew some criticism from immigrants. Read more about that controversy here.
ACROSS THE WIRE: Life and Hard Times on the Mexican Border, by Luis Alberto Urrea (1993)
Mr. Urrea, who is Mexican-American and was born in Tijuana, depicts the suffering of Mexico's poor in Tijuana through a series of vignettes. A Times reviewer compared this book, one of a several Mr. Urrea has written which reckon with border life, to Elie Wiesel's "Night," about life in an internment camp, and says that it's just as difficult to read. "But we keep returning to Mr. Urrea's prose because it is startling, poetic and razor-sharp; in the midst of the most brutal sequences, we are informed and shaken, made to feel the pain of others as if it were our own," wrote the reviewer.

Texto completo: The art critic Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times wrote about the symbolism of Notre Dame ("A France in turmoil weeps for a symbol of Paris' enduring identity," April 15), and why its burning is so devastating for the French ... completely ignoring the fact that the cathedral is first and foremost a symbol of Notre Dame, Our Lady, the Virgin Mary.
While the cathedral may indeed be the definitive symbol of "Frenchness," and the fire felt as a threat to that nation's collective identity, as Kimmelman suggests, for me and for many women I know, the fire symbolizes the threat to the sacred feminine everywhere -- through our president's thinly veiled hatred of women, through fundamentalist governments and through repressive religions, including some on American soil.
While many women are endorsing the #MeToo sentiment and feeling empowered, many people in power and those who support them are just as loudly yelling, "Oh, no you don't!" (The president's current attack against Rep. Ilhan Omar, inciting racism and violence against her, is a perfect example.)
We must be vigilant and protect the sacred feminine within ourselves and our world. However we honor and venerate the feminine -- through Our Lady of Guadalupe, Kali, Quan Yin, Spider Woman, Wonder Woman, our own mothers, grandmothers, daughters -- we must uphold Her divinity. We must continue to demand that the feminine perspective -- whether uttered by women or enlightened men, and whether we agree with it or not -- be heard. And we must work to stop violence against women and against the Divine Feminine in all her guises at any cost.

Fake photo used to push theory terrorists set fire at Notre Dame -BYLN-

Texto completo: As the 850-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was in flames last week, social media was filled with images posted by people at the scene.
But one photo of two men laughing as the cathedral burns behind them was doctored to fuel anti-Muslim rhetoric and falsely claim the fire was set by terrorists, according to PolitiFact.com.
The photo was shared on Facebook with the caption, "Muslims laughing while Notre Dame is burning."
French authorities have said they are not investigating arson or terrorism as a cause of the fire.
According to PolitiFact, the picture was posted on the day of the fire on Sputnik, a site run by the Russian government.
The National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado Denver pointed to an earlier version of the image, PolitiFact said.
"The two front persons are inserted," the center’s director Catalin Grigoras told PolitiFact. He said the image shows obvious editing.
The post was flagged in Facebook’s effort to identify false news and misinformation on its site, PolitiFact said.
YouTube algorithm failed A "misguided algorithm" on YouTube was blamed for information about the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. to be included alongside live streams of the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, according to The New York Times.
As news feeds of the Paris fire were streamed on YouTube, some were paired up with a panel that included information from the Encyclopaedia Britannica about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The mistake involved a fact-checking feature recently installed by YouTube, the Times said.
The feature is designed to pull information from the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia to include with topics which have often been the subject of misinformation, such as the moon landing or the Oklahoma City bombing.
"These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call," YouTube said in a statement.
No lawsuit after Pirro comment Social media posts claiming Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar filed a $100 million lawsuit against Fox News host Jeanine Pirro are false, according to The Associated Press.
During Pirro’s show "Justice with Judge Jeanine" last month, the TV host asked if the wearing of a hijab by Omar, a Muslim, is "antithetical to the U.S. Constitution," AP said.
No lawsuit has been filed in New York, where Fox News is headquartered, in Omar’s home state of Minnesota or in federal court, AP said.
The report of a lawsuit "is false," Omar spokesman Jeremy Slevin told AP.
Pirro’s show was off the air for two weeks following the comment about Omar, AP said.
Ocasio-Cortez was never on ‘Price is Right’ An image making the rounds on social media this month shows an appearance by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on "The Price is Right," guessing the price of an item as "free."
The photo is fake and accompanies a satirical article published on the website The Babylon Bee, according to Snopes.com.
The false story claims Ocasio-Cortez attended the show and "introduced herself as a U.S. representative and rising star of the Democratic Party," Snopes said. "Every time it was her turn to estimate the price of an item her answer was ‘free,’" the article said.
The doctored image is made up with a combination of an actual photo from an October episode of the daytime game show and a still photo taken from an appearance by Ocasio-Cortez on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in June 2018, Snopes said.
The appearance of the contestants on either side of Ocasio-Cortez were also altered to make it appear "less directly tied to an actual episode that aired," said The Babylon Bee, which says in a disclaimer it is a "trusted source for Christian news satire."

Texto completo: According to its tombstone, Trendalyzer was a data trend viewing platform that lived a happy life from 2007-2017.
Latitude, a location-aware feature of Google Maps, was just over 4 years old before it was euthanized in 2013.
Fabric, a platform that helped mobile teams build better apps, was sentenced to death after only one month of life.
All in, there are 161 current residents of the Google graveyard, on full display to the world at KilledByGoogle.com.
Of course, the tech giant has enjoyed tremendous success, even becoming an often used verb ("to Google").
With $136.8 billion in 2018 revenue, the company is valued today at over $860 billion. With such incredible performance, it would be easy to assume the company never fails.
Yet the way the organization embraces failure has actually helped vault them to legendary performance.
We are taught in school that failure is the worst possible thing; an evil to be avoided at all costs.
Yet time and time again, the most successful companies and careers have proven that missteps are not fatal. Rather, failure is the lifeblood of innovation. Mistakes are the portals of discovery.
At Google, celebrating failure — from the daily disasters to the colossal catastrophes — removes fear and enables creativity. Think about the message that having a public graveyard of killed ideas sends to the nearly 100,0000 Google team members: That all ideas are celebrated, that we can use the data of failure to enable new successes, that it takes some busted initiatives to facilitate breakthrough innovation.
It also shows that Google is willing to swing for the fences and willing to let go of previous efforts to discover new ones.
Failure is a part of life and a part of business. If you're not stumbling at times, you're probably not trying hard enough.
But how does your organization react when the chips fall in an undesirable manner? Do you hide the gaffes, pretending that mistakes never happen? Or do you celebrate them for what they are... an inevitable part of the innovation process?
By publicly and firmly embracing blunders, you actually liberate creativity. Fear is the kryptonite of innovation; whereas celebrating the losses can become your organization's superpower.
With their history-making success, Google is so proud of their 161 failures, they even built a website of tribute.
For you, remove the dark cloud of judgment, eradicate the fear of taking responsible risks, congratulate the smart ideas that didn't eventually work out, and in turn you will harness the incredible creativity of your team. A force that lies dormant in most companies, but can be your most powerful competitive weapon if harnessed.
Here's to your failures, and as a result, your success.

Texto completo: Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. felt the first stirrings of what would become his latest book, "Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow," during his 1969-70 sophomore year at Yale. He was enrolled in his first African-American history course - no such classes were given at his high school - and was introduced to Reconstruction, the brief period after the Civil War when blacks exerted their newfound rights and leadership in the former slave states. The course also covered the racist reaction to Reconstruction, known as Redemption, Gates writes, "when the former Confederate states 'redeemed' themselves at the expense of black rights" and took up with vehemence and violence the dictates of white supremacy. "I have connected Reconstruction with Redemption ever since, as the apex and nadir ... of the African American experience."
During that academic year, Gates also took a course on the Harlem Renaissance, a period of black intellectual and artistic ferment from the late 19th century to the mid-1920s; he continued to study that period and the emergence in those years of what became known as the New Negro. "In this book," Gates writes, "I attempt to show that the New Negro was the black community's effort to roll back Redemption, which was itself a rollback to Reconstruction, and to do so by coining a metaphor, of all things, and then by seeking to embody that metaphor." The result is "Stony the Road" - as Gates describes it, "an intellectual and cultural history of black agency and the resistance to and institutionalization of white supremacy." His title is borrowed from James Weldon Johnson's 1900 poem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," known as the Negro national anthem: "Stony the road we trod/ Bitter the chast'ning rod."
Gates' book covers territory well known to scholars and Civil War buffs: how our received wisdom of the "tragic decade" of Reconstruction flows from two polluted streams, the myth of the Lost Cause and the Jim Crow segregation mania that swept American legislatures and popular entertainment after 1900. For those wishing to know more about this dismal story of racial hysteria in places as high as Woodrow Wilson's White House and as low as the blackface minstrel show, "Stony the Road" is excellent one-stop shopping. With a main text of about 250 pages, Gates offers a compressed yet surprisingly comprehensive narrative sweep, in addition to the usual catalog of political sins, an overview of the lesser-known stories of how our "best" universities, such as Columbia and Harvard, allowed two pseudo-disciplines - "scientific racism" and eugenics - to create a false dogma of black misrule and white suffering at the center of the Reconstruction narrative.
With a dazzling selection of cartoon stereotypes, the author shows that in the white supremacist reaction "all along, the issue had been about the fabrication of hateful imagery in order to justify robbing black people of their constitutional rights and their economic potential."
In tracing the emergence of the New Negro, Gates notes that Booker T. Washington "was named the very first new Negro" by the white press. But Washington was "problematic" - he called for a regime of economic cooperation and social separation as a necessary condition of black progress. Gates observes that Washington was gradually eclipsed by more militant followers of Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois. The latter's scholarship in combination with the Harlem Renaissance saw the emergence of a "newer New Negro" and vigorous pursuit of the rights of equal treatment first promised by the Reconstruction Congress that passed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.
Gates is at his most fluent in defining the newer Negro as a feature of the Harlem Renaissance powered by Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and other key figures of the African-American creative pantheon. Locke is depicted as a flawed visionary who believed that artistic achievement would be as sure a path to equality as politics or economics. "They saw themselves as members of the black upper class," Gates writes, "a cosmopolitan mobile elite that could be integrated into American society, even if 'the slow-moving black masses' (as the head of the Urban League Charles S. Johnson would actually call them) could not."
Notwithstanding his high regard for the Renaissance, Gates clearly tilts toward politics, rather than art-for-art's-sake or pure commerce, as the most reliable vehicle for black progress. "No people, in all of human history, has ever been liberated by the creation of art. None," Gates asserts with a sense of certainty that is a signature of his rhetoric.
Analytically, this is a lively, consistently challenging book. I was struck by a sweeping criticism Gates offers in discussing the Harlem Renaissance. He blames Locke's 1925 anthology, "The New Negro," for ignoring "those great geniuses of black vernacular culture, the musicians who created the world's greatest art form in the entire twentieth century - jazz." The grandiose language feels like special pleading, based on personal taste, but Gates usefully reminds us that "jazz and its companion blues," while rooted in black culture, have a unique place in one of modernity's great stories, the African-American experience on the American continent in the previous century. Gates' telling of that story is a contribution to what we ought to be thinking about, given the rocky launch of this newest American century.

Texto completo: WATERVILLE -- Carlos Beason looked forward to visiting his friend's aunt's apartment growing up in Harlem, because she subscribed to Jet, a weekly news magazine for black America that began in 1951. In the pages of Jet, Beason saw everyday black people portrayed accurately and fairly. He couldn't find similar images anywhere else, and looking at the magazine changed how Beason saw himself and his place in the world, as well as his aspirations.
"That publication was the equivalent to my New York Times or Daily News," said Beason, a 22-year-old senior at Colby College in Waterville. "Those publications didn't have stories about people who looked like me. Had I not read Jet, I probably would not have believed it was possible for a black person to become president or win Oscars or Grammys or become Miss America or be successful in any career. Or go to Colby College."
This spring, Beason is talking up a new exhibition at the Colby College Museum of Art that uses thousands of images from Jet and Ebony magazines, filed in and displayed atop open shelves, to contextualize the experience of African Americans like him. The exhibition, "Facsimile Cabinet of Women Origin Stories," is the latest installation by Theaster Gates, who became an artist in residence at C0lby last year and serves as director of artist initiatives at the Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby.
Beason hosted his lacrosse teammates for a tour and talk and is working with other campus groups to do the same. He wants his peers to see this show so they have a better idea of who he is and what America looks like to him. "It's nice to take the time to look at the images and, after 15 or 20 minutes of reflection, come back as a group and have a better understanding of our place on campus and how we can be better members of the community and simply understand each other better," he said.
q q q

IN CASE YOU'VE missed the news, Gates is the hottest artist in America right now. In December, the New York Times called him "the style world's current cultural idol," a figure so hot that tastemakers Kanye West and Venus Williams sought his counsel during the most recent Art Basel gathering in Miami Beach. He just opened an exhibition in Paris that features the story of Malaga Island in Phippsburg, where a mixed-race community was forcibly evicted by the state of Maine in the early 1900s to improve tourism.
He's a social-practice artist, which is to say the work he creates comments on society and aims to address social ills. He focuses much of his work in Chicago, his home, where he became famous for turning discarded materials into sculpture and repurposing broken buildings into art centers and neighborhood hubs. In March, he was chosen to participate in Chicago's Architecture Biennial, a citywide cultural event that's designed around self-reflection and social justice and civic purpose.
Those themes have been the hallmark of Gates' work for a long time, and they're present in the piece at Colby. "Facsimile Cabinet of Women Origin Stories" includes nearly 3,000 images from the archive of the Chicago-based Johnson Publishing Co. That archive may well be the most important archive of the visual culture of black America in the 20th century, said museum director Sharon Corwin. At its height, Johnson was the largest black-owned publisher in the country. In addition to Jet, which began in 1971, Johnson also published Ebony, beginning in 1945. The company sold the magazines in 2016, and last week filed for bankruptcy in Chicago, formally ending its era and casting this exhibition in somber poignancy.
Gates' cabinet, installed in the lobby of the museum, honors women and grew out of his "Black Madonna" show last year at the Kunstmuseum Basel in Switzerland, in which he grappled with the death of his mother, Lorine.
"As I reflect on the 'Facsimile Cabinet,' I'm reminded that everyday women all over the world have moments when they manifest the divine," Gates wrote in a statement, emailed in response to questions about the exhibition. "In some ways, the 'Facsimile Cabinet' is about citing those women, showing the world what divinity looks like in the Black community. The miracles that Black women perform are not necessarily miracles that we understand from the prophets or the sages, but they're miracles nonetheless. Holding our countries together, ensuring that our children are safe, healing us, helping us get through school - these everyday acts, which so often go unrecognized, are made plain in the cabinet."
Gates' cabinets are installed in the interior lobby of the museum to the left of the main entrance into the galleries. The black walnut cabinets are lined along two walls, and there's one column that extends into lobby. The images we are asked to look at aren't hanging on the walls, but are placed on the shelves of the cabinet, like books on a bookshelf. To consider them, we must don white cotton gloves, remove the framed images from a shelf and place them on an angled surface atop the cabinet. In itself, that act feels reverential, almost spiritual.
The cabinets were custom built for the exhibition by Maine woodworkers Dan Bloomer and Mark Roman. To provide context for the wood craft element of the installation, the museum has placed Gates' piece among wooden sculpture and relief work by Louise Nevelson and Bernard Langlais.
The framed images are reproductions of pictures from the magazines, of the newsmakers, athletes, stars and leaders of the 1960s and 1970s - the activist Coretta Scott King, singer Nancy Wilson and actress Janet MacLachlan are a few random examples. Other images document the working processes of the photographers, designers and editors at the magazines. In addition to the hundreds of finished photographs, we also see contact sheets, crop marks, notes and other indications of artistic practice. Gates licensed the images from Johnson, for use with this and other exhibitions.
With these images and this exhibition, Gates is making the world blacker.
"Can I jump in and assign myself temporary CEO of Johnson Publishing and have that temporary assignment lead to a redeployment of Black images so that people don't view them as nostalgic, but rather as the ongoing reoccurrence of Black power within the contemporary art world and without?" he asked in his email. "In this way, it is not an intellectual journey of the archive, or my intellectual investigation of Johnson Publishing, in fact, it is just the opposite. It is is my visceral deep desire to occupy the Black image and to see the Black image do positive damage in the world so that the world wants more and more to be Black, to value Blackness, to understand the complexity of the histories of Black Americans, so that the image wins for us all - not just for me."

VIEWERS CAN DECIDE what images they want to spend time with, how many they want to take out from the shelves and whether to return them to the shelves or leave them out for public view. It's democratic and self-directed at the same time. The idea is to spur questions and investigations.
"Who are these people and what is their story in American history?" said Daisy Desrosiers, director of programs for the Lunder Institute for American Art at the Colby Museum. "It is only through the process of looking that you get to discover the images."
The hands-on approach is a hallmark of Gates' artistic practice. At first, visitors aren't quite sure what to do "with his generous invitation to touch," Desrosiers said. When they realize they can and must handle the work, their surprise quickly turns to delight, she said. "Part of Theaster's generosity as an artist, he is offering us a structure. The interaction is up to you."
This exhibition is a collaboration between the museum and the Lunder Institute. The museum organized and is hosting the exhibition, while the Lunder Institute provides programming and scholarship that amplify it. For "Facsimile Cabinet of Women Origin Stories," Desrosiers is hosting 15 women scholars from various fields to each spend a day with the collection of images when the museum is closed to the public. The scholars will come one at a time from across Maine and New England, and they include artists, copyright attorneys, archivists, anthropologists and documentarians, among others. The idea is to open up the archive to them and allow them the opportunity to explore it, study it and create conversations around it, Desrosiers said.
Desrosiers has enjoyed encountering the women in these photos - and the artists who made these images - at different moments in their lives. As a young black woman from Montreal, Desrosiers has found the archive to be an opportunity for a history lesson, and getting to know it has led to her own self-awareness. "As a young professional, it speaks to who I am in the world and what it means to question your identity and to be evolving and growing through these images," she said. "You have access to something that opens up your eyes and allows you to meet people and allows you to meet your history in a very different way. It gives me answers and a way into history I did not have access to or did not know. It's an aesthetic moment I didn't witness but am glad to know that happened. It's a huge gift, and one I never get tired of unwrapping."

Texto completo: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Conan O'Brien fell under the spell of the historian and biographer Robert A. Caro when he was a student at Harvard in the 1980s. The book that made him a fan was "The Path to Power," the first installment of the multivolume epic "The Years of Lyndon Johnson."
Mr. O'Brien devoured the second, third and fourth volumes of the still-growing series, and across his 26 years as a talk-show host, he put in numerous requests to interview the Pulitzer Prize winner. Mr. Caro found time over the years to appear on shows hosted by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, but he always said no to Mr. O'Brien.
On Tuesday, there was a happy resolution.
"I'm anxious," Mr. O'Brien said as he rode in a black S.U.V. from the Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, where he tapes his TBS show, to Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, where he would interview Mr. Caro. "It's very unusual to meet somebody whose work you're so familiar with."
In an interview with The New York Times last year, Mr. O'Brien said, "The Lyndon Johnson books by Caro, it's our Harry Potter," and described in detail his many thwarted attempts to sit down with Mr. Caro. The author finally caved on the occasion of his tour for "Working," his new, relatively slim book on his writing and research methods.
At 83, Mr. Caro is enjoying a moment of appreciation, and he has made appearances in recent days in Austin, Tex., Philadelphia and New York, his home city. Mr. O'Brien, 55, acknowledged that he had not exactly landed an exclusive.
"People keep saying, 'I heard him on this podcast,"' he said. "'He dropped in at Coachella.' 'He opened a mall in Paramus."'
The S.U.V. turned onto North La Cienega Boulevard. Mr. O'Brien pointed at a building.
"That's where I got started in this business," he said. "The Coronet Theatre. I took improv classes there with a talented young person named Lisa Kudrow. If you had told me then that 33 years from now I'd be in a car with a writer from The New York Times on my way to interview Robert Caro, I would have said, 'That sounds about right."'
In the rabbi's study at Temple Emanuel, he didn't have to wait long for Mr. Caro.
"They probably told you," Mr. O'Brien said, "I'm a fan to a disturbing level."
"I want to say, if I've ever been asked to be on your show, my publisher never told me," Mr. Caro replied.
"I like this way better," Mr. O'Brien said. "I respect you too much to have you on my show."
After a handshake that lasted 30 seconds, they sat at a conference table. Then something strange occurred. Mr. Caro effectively started interviewing Mr. O'Brien. What was his thesis at Harvard? After Mr. O'Brien said it was on the works of Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner, Mr. Caro asked him if he had ever spent time in the South and followed up by asking the host what he thought of the region's relationship to the larger United States.
"Wow, I love that you're asking my opinion on anything," Mr. O'Brien said.
The conversation tilted toward President Trump.
"You don't know if this is an aberration or not, if Trump is something outside, and he's going to lose, and we'll forget," Mr. Caro said. "Or, is he the first of the mad Roman emperors?"
They briefly went over Mr. Caro's appearance on Mr. O'Brien's new podcast, "Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend," which was scheduled for the next day. "We have a very young audience," Mr. O'Brien said. "I want them to hear about work ethic."
It was almost 7:30. Show time.
They stepped out of the study and into a standing ovation from the 550 people who had paid $20 for general admission or $38 for a seat and a copy of "Working." Mr. O'Brien called the event, which had been organized by Writers Bloc, a nonprofit literary series in Los Angeles, the "thrill of a lifetime." He added, "I also want to thank you, Mr. Caro, for finally writing a book that'll fit on my night table."
Mr. O'Brien gave a shout-out to Mr. Caro's wife and longtime working partner, the historian Ina Caro, who was seated in the front row. He noted the dedication she displayed in agreeing to move with her husband to the Texas Hill Country, where President Johnson was raised, back when Mr. Caro was looking for insights into his subject's early years.
Mr. O'Brien added that his wife, Liza Powel O'Brien, who was also in attendance, wouldn't have gone along with such a thing; but Ms. Caro, he said, was completely on board.
"Not exactly," Ms. Caro whispered to the person seated next to her.
Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Caro dug into Lyndon Johnson's life. His father. His mistress. His ambition. They also talked at length about Mr. Caro's writing process. As the discussion went on, Mr. O'Brien found himself far from the talk show format. Mr. Caro spoke the way he writes, answering questions in shapely monologues that lasted five or six minutes.
An hour in, Mr. O'Brien asked the author how he felt about the Horace Mann School, his high school alma mater in the Bronx, having named a prize after him.
"No one has ever asked me that," Mr. Caro said.
"I've been waiting a long time," Mr. O'Brien replied.
The host then asked Mr. Caro if he agreed with Ernest Hemingway's comment that a writer should not "exhaust the fuel tank in one writing session," so that it's easier to start again the next day.
"Yes, and you're the first person that ever mentioned that," Mr. Caro said, before noting that he had written his thesis at Princeton on Mr. Hemingway.
"Why am I in comedy?" Mr. O'Brien said.
Did Mr. Caro ever take breaks? Sneak away from his desk to an afternoon movie?
"See the new 'Avengers,"' Mr. O'Brien suggested. "Ina doesn't have to know about it."
"Never in my entire life," Mr. Caro replied.
Mr. O'Brien proposed coming by Mr. Caro's office one day and taking him to a matinee.
"If I don't answer," Mr. Caro said, "it's because I'm so deep in the work."
After a Q. and A. session and another round of applause, Mr. Caro seemed pleased. "I thought these questions tonight were exceptional," he said in a side room. "Incisive."
To think, the event had almost been scuttled.
On Tuesday morning, Mr. Caro's flight from Austin to Los Angeles was canceled. Mr. Caro said he immediately thought of Mr. O'Brien. "That was in my mind," he said. "I said, 'He's never going to believe it, if I said the flight got canceled."'
His publishing house, Knopf, had to make a decision: pull out of the interview, or find a way to make it happen. The publisher quickly booked a charter flight -- Mr. Caro described it as an eight-seater jet -- to Van Nuys Airport.
"The downside of canceling the event was disappointing Mr. Caro's legion of admirers," said Paul Bogaards, a spokesman at Knopf. "Additionally, the prospect of sending Conan into an irrevocable tailspin did not sit well with me. God knows, he's waited long enough for this to happen."

Texto completo: The Mueller report is like a legal version of a thriller movie in which three malevolent forces are attacking a city all at once. Everybody's wondering if the three attackers are working together. The report concludes that they weren't, but that doesn't make the situation any less scary or the threat any less real.
The first force is Donald Trump, who represents a threat to the American systems of governance. Centuries ago our founders created a system of laws and not men. In our system of government there are procedures in place, based on certain values - impartiality, respect for institutions, the idea that a public office is a public trust, not a private bauble.
When Trump appears in the Mueller report, he is often running roughshod over these systems and violating these values. He asks his lawyer to hamper an investigation. He asks his FBI director to take the heat off his allies. He tries to get the relevant investigators fired. I don't know if his actions meet the legal standard of obstruction of justice, but they certainly meet the common-sense standard of interference with justice.
The second force is Russia. If Trump is a threat to the institutional infrastructure, the Russians are a threat to our informational infrastructure. We knew this already, but it was still startling to see the fact declared so bluntly - that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election "in sweeping and systematic fashion."
It may not be bombing buildings or shooting at people, but if a foreign government is attacking the factual record on which democracy runs, it is still a sort of warfare. The Russians are trying to undermine the information we use to converse, and the trust that makes conversation possible.
The third force is Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. They are a threat to our deliberative infrastructure. Any organization needs to be able to hold private conversations in order to deliberate. Whether it is State Department cables or Democratic National Committee emails, WikiLeaks has violated privacy and made it harder for institutions to function. 
The Mueller report indicates that Trump was not colluding with Russia. But it also shows that working relationships were beginning to be built, through networkers like Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and Roger Stone. More important, it shows that many of the Trumpists, the Russians and the WikiLeaks crowd all understood that they were somehow adjacent actors in the same project.
I would say that's the report's central importance. We are being threatened in a very distinct way. The infrastructure of the society is under threat - the procedures that shape government, the credibility of information, the privacy rules that make deliberation possible. And though the Chinese government does not play a big role here, it represents a similar sort of threat - to our intellectual infrastructure, the intellectual property rights that organize innovation.
These forces are motivated by self-interest, but their common feature is an operational nihilism. They are trying to sow disorder at the foundation of society. The goal is not really to convert anybody to a cause; it is to create cynicism and disruption that will open up the space to grab what you want to grab. They rig the system and then tell everybody, "The system is rigged!" And therefore, all values are suspended. Everything is permitted.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: Clare Bronfman, heredera del imperio licorero Seagram’s, se declaró culpable ayer en un tribunal del distrito neoyorquino de Brooklyn por el caso de la secta sexual Nxivm, acusada de tráfico y esclavitud en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Bronfman (40) era considerada la directora de operaciones de la organización Nxvim, junto con su fundador, Keith Raniere, y la actriz Allison Mack, de la serie de televisión “Smallville”.
El 8 de abril, Mack (36) admitió la culpabilidad de dos cargos de crimen organizado y conspiración, pero aún tiene pendientes otros relacionados con tráfico sexual, usurpación de identidad y blanqueo de dinero.
Raniere (58) es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de quince años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.
Además de Bronfman, también se espera que se declare culpable otra de los miembros del grupo, Kathy Russell, apuntaron medios locales.
El pasado 13 de marzo, la presidenta de Nxivm, Nancy Salzman, también se declaró culpable de conspiración para crimen organizado, robo de identidad y alteración de documentación. Otra acusada es su hija Lauren Salzman.
Así, Raniere es el único de los acusados que podría acabar enfrentándose a un juicio , destacó EFE.
Raniere ha negado todos los cargos presentados contra él. Su abogado, Marc Agnifilo, ha informado que piensan ir a juicio, y se mostró aliviado de que Bronfman y Russell no vayan a pasar por el proceso judicial, ya que no cree que “se las debía haber acusado”.
La fiscalía acusa a estos miembros de la cúpula directiva de Nxivm de una serie de crímenes, entre ellos conspirar para cometer robo de identidad, blanquear dinero, tráfico sexual, extorsión y posesión de pornografía infantil.
En abril de 2018 Raniere fue deportado desde México tras ser acusado formalmente en un tribunal de Nueva York.
En 1998, este supuesto gurú de la motivación personal creó la organización “Programas Ejecutivos de Éxito”, a través de la cual impartía talleres de cinco días por los que cobraba hasta $5 mil dólares.
Años más tarde fundó Nxivm, la secta que estableció en el norte de Nueva York y donde obligaba a los asistentes a tomar clases adicionales a mayor precio y a traer a otras personas para “ascender” dentro de los rangos internos de la organización y así obtener “privilegios”.
En 2015, Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes”, donde él era el único hombre y líder. La secta operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.

Actriz en silla de ruedas hace historia al protagonizar un musical en Broadway

Texto completo: Dos triángulos de amor, uno trágico y otro relajado, han hecho de “¡Oklahoma!” uno de los musicales más resistentes al tiempo , desde su estreno en marzo de 1943, hace exactamente 76 años, como la primera colaboración entre el compositor Richard Rodgers y el libretista Oscar Hammerstein.
Ahora está de vuelta en Broadway, igualmente ambientado en 1906, pero con giros muy contemporáneos a la sociopolítica y el mercadeo el siglo XXI: mujeres liberales, una pareja protagónica es biracial -ella negra, él blanco-; y en el elenco hay una actriz en silla de ruedas (Ali Stroker), algo inédito en el teatro musical de Nueva York, y que la coloca en ruta a las nominaciones a los premios.
Stroker es una actriz rumbo a los 32 años, nativa de Ridgewood, Nueva Jersey . A los 2 años un accidente de tránsito la dejó paralizada de la cintura para abajo, debido a una lesión de la médula espinal. Pero ello no detuvo la meta profesional que se fijó desde que, a los 7 años, vio un primer musical de Broadway.
Estudió y en 2009 se convirtió en la primera actriz en silla de ruedas en obtener un título del Departamento de Teatro de Tisch de la Universidad de Nueva York , con un título en Bellas Artes. Que se sepa, es la primera intérprete en silla de ruedas en un musical de Broadway, donde como todos debe cantar, bailar y actuar.
Su rol (Ado Annie) no es nada sumiso, al contrario, es el personaje femenino más liberal, infiel y pícaro en la trama. Las críticas han sido muy favorables a todo el equipo, e incluso con ironía Ben Brantley escribió en The New York Times, “¿Cómo es posible que el nuevo show más genial de Broadway en 2019 sea un musical de 1943?”
Además se está presentando en una sala muy peculiar, Circle in the Square , que coloca al público cerca de los actores, planteando un reto adicional para el director, Daniel Fish, apoyado en una interesante iluminación de Scott Zielinski.
Aquí la audiencia no está al frente, sino alrededor del escenario, que es más largo que ancho. Para lograr más interacción aún, los presentes son invitados a probar, en el intermedio, la comida que los personajes “cocinan” durante el primer acto.
Este musical “country” o rural está basado en la obra “Green Grow the Lilacs” (1931) de Lynn Riggs, autor de sangre indígena cherokee. Se centra en la vida sencilla de unos granjeros y vaqueros , mayormente ingenuos, celosos y conservadores, amantes de la caza, los caballos, el baile y el alcohol, y para quienes el honor siempre está a un balazo de distancia.
No son en esencia violentos, sino simples en su manera de ver el mundo y resolver los problemas en la mentalidad de 1906, vigente hoy en muchas zonas rurales en EEUU. En ese entonces, Oklahoma aún no era un estado, sino un “territorio de reserva indígena”.
Las coreografías originales se mantienen simples, mayormente integradas a la trama, cuando los personajes celebran en algún establo dentro de su rutina de “pueblo pequeño, infierno grande”, donde la amistad se debate entre camaradería, celos, amor, venganza y envidia. Así, una boda puede mutar a un funeral y luego a un juicio penal, pues también son rápidos a la hora de imponer justicia, al estilo “Fuenteovejuna” (1619) de Lope de Vega.
En su largo periplo, “¡Oklahoma!” fue adaptada al cine y ganó dos premios Óscars en rubros técnicos en 1955, entre cuatro nominaciones. También se ha producido para TV y teatro en varias ocasiones y lugares. En Broadway estuvo por última vez en 2002 y el estreno actual es la 6ta producción en Nueva York.
La más exitosa fue la primera, que sumó 2.212 presentaciones en poco más de cinco años, aliviando los horrores de la 2da Guerra Mundial. Esta vez el calendario es limitado, sólo de abril al 1 de septiembre.

Texto completo: [Video: A preview of "BlackKklansman." Watch on YouTube.]
Spike Lee's Oscar-winning joint airs on HBO. And Netflix rings in 4/20 with a new documentary on marijuana.
What's on TV
BLACKkKLANSMAN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. Spike Lee finally won his first competitive Oscar for this timely biographical drama. John David Washington stars as Ron Stallworth, a black officer in Colorado Springs who infiltrates his local Ku Klux Klan chapter in the 1970s with the help of his white colleague, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver). Stallworth builds the Klan's trust by posing as a white supporter on phone calls with the society's grand wizard, David Duke (Topher Grace), while Zimmerman acts as his surrogate, meeting with paranoid Klan members in person. Lee sprinkles moments of comic relief, but the movie is tense all around: The suspense grips you until the very end when all the main characters gather in the same room. What makes the film all the more powerful is that it's grounded in reality (the screenplay is adapted from Stallworth's memoir) and that it speaks volumes about today's political climate. A. O. Scott named the movie a Critic's Pick in his New York Times review, writing that "'BlacKkKlansman' is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth."
I AM SOMEBODY'S CHILD: THE REGINA LOUISE STORY (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. This new drama tells the true story of Regina Louise (Angela Fairley), a black woman who had been in and out of 30 foster homes before the age of 18. When she was a child, Regina met Jeannie Kerr (Ginnifer Goodwin), a white counselor at a children's shelter in California; Jeannie tried but failed to adopt Regina because a ruling prevented white people from taking in black children. Decades later, they cross paths again in a miraculous reunion.
HOW HIGH 2 (2019) 9 p.m. on MTV. MTV is celebrating the high holiday with this new sequel to the 2001 stoner comedy "How High." The follow-up centers on two "potrepreneurs" (played by Lil' Yachty and D.C. Young Fly) who discover a weed bible in a basement and wind up growing some very potent buds. When someone steals their new guide and magical marijuana plant, the pair light some joints and set out on a journey to find their "super weed." Other cast members include Deray Davis, NeNe Leakes and Mike Epps, who reprises his role as Baby Powder.
What's Streaming
GRASS IS GREENER (2019) Stream on Netflix. For a more serious take, watch this documentary by the hip-hop pioneer and first-time feature director Fred Brathwaite, also known as Fab 5 Freddy. Experts and celebrities -- including Snoop Dogg and Damian Marley -- reflect on marijuana's influence on jazz, hip-hop and pop culture over the years. They also dissect the darker strands of the plant's history, weighing in on how the war on drugs allowed for a crackdown on marijuana users and the racial disparity in drug-related arrests. "As cannabis goes mainstream," Brathwaite narrates, "it's easy to forget the past."

Texto completo: Personal sanction against CEO would be a rare rebuke from regulators
Federal regulators investigating Facebook for mishandling its users' personal information have set their sights on the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, exploring his past statements on privacy and weighing whether to seek new, heightened oversight of his leadership.
The discussions about how to hold Zuckerberg accountable for Facebook's data lapses have come in the context of wide-ranging talks between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook that could settle the government's probe of more than a year, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because the FTC's inquiry is confidential under law.
Such a move could create new legal, political and public-relations headaches for one of Silicon Valley's best-known - and most image-conscious - corporate leaders. Zuckerberg is Facebook's co-founder, chief executive, board chairman and most powerful stock owner, and a sanction from the federal government would be seen as a rare rebuke to him and the tech giant's "move fast and break things" ethos.
In recent weeks, Zuckerberg has promised to reorient Facebook into a "privacy-focused communications platform" as the company looks to change its "reputation" and focus instead on secure, intimate communications between users along with content that "won't stick around forever."
But on Thursday, Facebook revealed another privacy mishap, admitting it mishandled millions of users' passwords for Instagram, the company's photo-sharing app. Facebook tucked news of the development into an old blog post as Washington scrambled over the release of the U.S. government's findings from its probe of Russia and the 2016 election. To privacy advocates and congressional critics, Facebook's move amounted to the latest sign that the company and its leaders have failed to learn from past mistakes - and should face heightened oversight.
"The days of pretending this is an innocent platform are over, and citing Mark in a large-scale enforcement action would drive that home in spades," said Roger McNamee, an early investor in the company and one of Zuckerberg's foremost critics.
In past investigations of Facebook, the U.S. government opted to spare Zuckerberg from the most onerous scrutiny. Documents obtained from the FTC under federal open-records laws reflect that the agency considered, then backed down from putting Zuckerberg directly under order during its last settlement with Facebook in 2011. Had it done so, Zuckerberg could have faced fines for future privacy violations.
Asked about the negotiations, Facebook said in a statement it "hope[s] to reach an appropriate and fair resolution." The FTC declined to comment.
The FTC began investigating Facebook in March 2018 following reports that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy, improperly accessed data on roughly 87 million of the social networking site's users. The federal probe has focused on whether Facebook violated an agreement, brokered with the FTC in 2011, that required the company to improve its privacy practices. Since then, Facebook has acknowledged a series of additional privacy lapses, including its Instagram admission Thursday.
Appearing before Congress last year, Zuckerberg sought to take personal responsibility for a range of his company's recent missteps, such as Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica. "I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here," he told lawmakers. But the Facebook chief still maintained that the company did not commit a "violation of the consent decree" it had struck with the FTC.
Settling that federal inquiry could force Facebook to make significant concessions, including paying a fine ranging into the billions of dollars, The Washington Post previously has reported. It could result in new obligations targeting Zuckerberg, too. One idea that has been raised could require him or other executives to certify the company's privacy practices periodically to the board of directors, two people familiar with the matter said, along with heightened oversight by the FTC.
It is unclear if the FTC and Facebook are still contemplating such a requirement, or if they've struck an agreement on these or other outstanding matters. But Facebook has fought fiercely to shield Zuckerberg as part of the negotiations, one of the sources familiar with the probe said. Either Facebook or the FTC could choose to walk away from talks, resulting in the matter heading to court.
The idea of holding Zuckerberg accountable - and even subjecting him to penalties for Facebook's alleged mishandling of users' data - has gained political traction in Washington. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement that the top executive "wasn't just aware of Facebook's invasion of consumer privacy, he signed off on it and publicly downplayed legitimate concerns."
"Holding Mark Zuckerberg and other top Facebook executives personally at fault and liable for further wrongdoing would send a powerful message to business leaders across the country: You will pay a hefty price for skirting the law and deceiving consumers," Blumenthal added.
Some of the FTC's own decision-makers also have aired their support for penalties against executives when their companies are under investigation. In a May 2018 memo, Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra said the agency "should hold individual executives accountable for order violations in which they participated, even if these individuals were not named in the original orders." He didn't mention Facebook by name, and he did not respond to requests for comment.
Zuckerberg still could escape largely unaffected as a result of negotiations with the FTC. If he does, it would not be the first time. More than eight years ago, when the FTC cobbled together its initial settlement with Facebook, agency staff weighed whether to target Zuckerberg personally. An unreleased and undated early draft of the FTC's consent order against Facebook, obtained by The Post through a Freedom of Information Act request, explicitly named Zuckerberg as a respondent - meaning he would have faced heightened federal oversight and the risk of fines and other penalties in the event of future privacy missteps.
In the end, however, the FTC dropped mention of him from a version of the order shared around April 2011, according to email records obtained from the agency under open-records laws. The agency also considered, then removed, a provision from its early settlement that would have required Facebook to pay an unspecified sum to the government, the records show. The form of punishment, called disgorgement, requires a company to return ill-gotten monetary gains. The draft consent decree included only "xxx" instead of an exact amount, and the language was ultimately removed by the time the FTC announced its agreement with Facebook in November 2011.
This time, FTC veterans have encouraged the agency to take direct aim at Zuckerberg, even putting him personally under order and subjecting him to further federal oversight. David Vladeck, who served as the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC in 2011, criticized the company this week because it "did not take that first consent decree seriously."
"I would hope any future order names Zuckerberg," he said, adding that doing so "ratchets pressure up on the company to make the CEO responsible."
The FTC's 2011 consent decree with Facebook requires the company to be more upfront with consumers about the data it collects and obtain their permission before it overrides their existing privacy settings. Facebook also is barred from misrepresenting what it does with users' data, while submitting to 20 years of privacy checkups.
Talks between Facebook and the FTC have intensified in recent weeks, as the agency's investigation passed its first anniversary. Top Facebook officials, including general counsel Colin Stretch, met with individual Democratic and Republican commissioners in March, according to two additional people familiar with the agency's work who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a private probe.
While the FTC probes Facebook, a number of states' attorneys general have embarked on their own investigation. Karl A. Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, has filed a privacy lawsuit against the company.
Other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, have investigated Facebook's relationship with Cambridge Analytica. And a federal grand jury in March sent subpoenas to two tech companies with which Facebook struck data-sharing agreements, the New York Times reported, noting that the target of such a criminal probe remains unclear.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand said at a campaign stop in Iowa Thursday that she and her colleagues miss Al Franken, who she helped pressure into resigning from the Senate in 2017 over his apparent sexual misconduct.

"We are all concerned about Sen. Franken and we all miss him. He was someone who really served us well on the judiciary committee and was a strong senator," the New York lawmaker said in Council Bluffs. "But the truth is he had eight credible allegations against him for groping and forcible kissing."

Her remarks were taped by America Rising, a Republican opposition research group.

Gillibrand was the first Democratic senator to call for Franken to leave office after a number of women shared uncomfortable experiences with him. Over two dozen other Democratic senators eventually joined Gillibrand in asking Franken to step down.

"Of course he had every right to stick out and go to his ethics committee investigation. That might have taken another six months, nine months. Of course he had that right. Of course he had the right to sue all the women who accused him all his rights," Gillibrand said. "He chose to resign. that was his decision and his decision alone. No other member of Congress or senator can make another member resign."

Gillibrand's charge against Franken created a fissure among certain Democratic voters over what some feel as an overly-harsh reaction to his alleged behavior. The New York Times reported in March that Gillibrand's presidential campaign fears that some prominent donors are withholding money over the incident.

“There’s no question that the first quarter was adversely impacted by certain establishment donors — and many online — who continue to punish Kirsten for standing up for her values and for women,” an internal campaign memo read. In quarter one of 2019, Gillibrand's presidential campaign raised only $3 million.

Recent polls also show Gillibrand struggling to gain a foothold in an increasingly large Democratic primary field. A Monmouth survey released in April showed Gillibrand polling at 1% among Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa.

Trump's actual greatest sin

Texto completo: It has long been presumed that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation was based on an original sin: President Trump's May 2017 decision to fire James B. Comey as director of the FBI.
But Mueller's long-awaited report argues that an action of greater potential criminality on the president's part was one that came a month later, on June 17.
On that Saturday, Trump twice telephoned his then-White House counsel Donald McGahn from Camp David and told McGahn to get rid of Mueller himself.
Though one of the qualifications required of those who work for this president is a high tolerance for his impulsive and questionable behavior, the White House counsel was shocked when Trump told him, "Mueller has to go."
McGahn refused to carry out an order that, according to the special counsel's report, he believed was on a par with President Richard M. Nixon's infamous "Saturday Night Massacre" during the Watergate scandal.
"McGahn considered the President's request to be an inflection point and he wanted to hit the brakes," the special counsel's report said.
From there, McGahn "called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told [then-White House Chief of Staff Reince] Priebus that the President had asked him to 'do crazy s---.' "
Ultimately, McGahn decided to stay in his job for another 16 months, and Trump dropped his efforts to remove Mueller. But the relationship between the president and his White House counsel remained strained and was made more so when it became known that McGahn had given 30 hours of testimony to Mueller.
The broad outlines of Trump's effort to get rid of Mueller had been known, though the president himself had lied when the New York Times first reported it in January 2018. "Fake news, folks," Trump said at the time.
"Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the President's awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper," the special counsel's 448 -page document noted.
The Mueller report not only provides a striking and much fuller narrative of Trump's actions themselves but also shows why they might put his presidency in jeopardy. Though Trump would not be criminally prosecuted while in office, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said at a news conference Thursday that the Mueller report showed "clear evidence" Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and that impeachment is "one possibility."
Mueller also rejected claims by the president and his allies that he is shielded from obstruction-of-justice laws, writing: "The Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize the president."
One reason Trump's effort to fire Mueller could be so damaging is what it says about the president's frame of mind; as the report notes, obstruction is a crime only if the perpetrator acted "knowingly and dishonestly" or "with an improper motive."
When Trump fired Comey, according to the report, he believed - based on assurances from the FBI director himself - that he was not personally under investigation. But as a result of Comey's dismissal, the probe did indeed pivot toward Trump himself, which the president learned in a Post article published three days before he demanded that McGahn fire Mueller.
So began what the report described as the second of "two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President's motives."
"The President became aware that investigators were conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked a significant change in the President's conduct and the start of a second phase of action," the report said. "The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation."
In stopping Trump from firing Mueller, McGahn no doubt thought he was saving the president from himself, and - not incidentally - the White House counsel's own reputation.
Standing firm to rescue Mueller's job was the right thing to do, and an act of defiance that we see too rarely among those with whom Trump surrounds himself. But the fact that McGahn had to do it could be the most damning evidence of all to be produced by the investigation - and the dogged investigator - that the president could not make go away.

The 10 Trump actions Mueller spotlighted for potential obstruction

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declined to say whether President Trump committed a crime. But his report laid out 10 episodes of potential obstruction of justice by Trump.
"The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgment," the report states. "At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment."
Here's a breakdown of the situations examined by the special counsel's office:
1. "Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn" Shortly after Trump fired Flynn, the White House's national security adviser, for lying about his interactions with the Russian ambassador during the transition, he pressured James B. Comey, then the FBI director, to "let it go."
"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go," Trump said, suggesting Flynn should not be subjected to additional legal scrutiny.
Trump has denied saying such a thing, but Mueller says it happened.
Trump also directed deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland to send an email denying that Trump instructed Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador. McFarland declined to do so, since she didn't know whether it was true.
2. "The President's reaction to the continuing Russia investigation" Trump attempted to prevent Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the investigation before the special counsel was appointed. He said he needed an attorney general who would protect him.
Trump also tried to get top intelligence officials and Comey to publicly distance Trump from the investigation. His outreach to Comey came despite guidance from White House counsel Donald McGahn not to get involved in internal Justice Department matters.
3. "The President's termination of Comey" The report indicates that the breaking point for Trump was when Comey testified to Congress that there was a Russia investigation but declined to elaborate or say whether anyone on the Trump campaign was a target - including whether he had ruled out Trump personally.
Trump quickly declared to Sessions: "This is terrible, Jeff. It's all because you recused." Then the next weekend, the report says, "the President stated that he wanted to remove Comey and had ideas for a letter that would be used to make the announcement." The implication was that Trump was trying to protect Flynn from legal scrutiny.
A memo was drafted explaining Comey's firing, but one aide wrote at the time that the White House Counsel's Office had decided that it should not see the "light of day" and that they should instead rely on justifications offered by Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.
4. "The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him" Trump responded to the May 2017 appointment of Mueller as special counsel by saying he was "fucked" and that it was "the end of his presidency." Trump insisted that Mueller had conflicts of interest, but was told they were meritless and that they had already been a part of his consideration.
Three days after the media reported that Mueller was looking into potential obstruction, Trump called McGahn and told him to have Rosenstein publicly attack Mueller's alleged conflicts and call for his removal. McGahn declined.
5. "Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel's investigation" The report says Trump, two days after the above event, also tried to get Sessions to attack the investigation.
"On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was 'very unfair' to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special Counsel and 'let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections,' " the report states. "Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do."
But Lewandowski dragged his feet. Eventually, when Trump followed up a month later, Lewandowski asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to do it. "Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through," the report says.
6. "Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence" Mueller fills in the details of previous Washington Post reporting that Trump sought to mislead about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
"On several occasions, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited," the report states. "Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with 'an individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have information helpful to the campaign' and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children."
7. "Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation" Trump called Sessions at home in summer 2017 to ask him to un-recuse himself and take control of the Russia probe. Sessions declined. Trump asked Sessions in October 2017 to take another look at investigating Hillary Clinton. He also told him in December 2017 that if he un-recused, he would be a "hero."
Trump told Sessions, "I'm not going to do anything or direct you to do anything, I just want to be treated fairly."
8. "Efforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special Counsel removed" This episode was originally reported by the New York Times in March 2018, but Mueller fills in the details.
According to the report:
"On January 26, 2018, the President's personal counsel called McGahn's attorney and said that the President wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest. McGahn's attorney spoke with McGahn about that request and then called the President's personal counsel to relay that McGahn would not make a statement. McGahn's attorney informed the President's personal counsel that the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed. Accordingly, McGahn's attorney said, although the article was inaccurate in some other respects, McGahn could not comply with the President's request to dispute the story. [White House spokeswoman Hope] Hicks recalled relaying to the President that one of his attorneys had spoken to McGahn's attorney about the issue."
9. "Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, [REDACTED]" Flynn pleaded guilty to lying and cut a deal with Mueller to cooperate - and accordingly had to withdraw from his joint defense agreement with Trump's legal team. But Trump's personal lawyer reached out to Flynn's team and assured them that Trump still had warm feelings for Flynn. The lawyer also asked for a heads-up in case Flynn had any "information that implicates that President." When Flynn's lawyer said such information couldn't be shared, Trump's lawyer said he would relay the message of "hostility" to Trump.
The report also noted that Trump continued to praise Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, during his trials and that he left open of the possibility of a pardon. Manafort also agreed to cooperate before he voided his deal by lying to investigators.
10. "Conduct involving Michael Cohen" While Michael Cohen has said Trump didn't directly tell him to lie to Congress about the effort to build a Trump Tower in Moscow lingering into the 2016 campaign, Cohen accuses Trump's lawyers of guiding his testimony. And one key figure declined to dispute that.
"While preparing for his congressional testimony, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President's personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should 'stay on message' and not contradict the President."
When Cohen didn't contradict Trump (by lying), he earned praise. According to the report: "Cohen recalled that the President's personal counsel said 'his client' appreciated Cohen, that Cohen should stay on message and not contradict the President, that there was no need to muddy the water, and that it was time to move on. Cohen said he agreed because it was what he was expected to do. After Cohen later pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, this Office sought to speak with the President's personal counsel about these conversations with Cohen, but counsel declined, citing potential privilege concerns."

Texto completo: NORWAY — Author and Registered Maine Guide Earl Brechlin will read from his new collection of evocative and heartfelt essays about Maine’s iconic landscapes, the power of family, and the search for meaning and renewal in the embrace of wilderness, during an appearance at the Norway Memorial Library on Tuesday, April 30, from 6:30 to 8 p.m.
Along with the reading, he will share a slideshow showing the connections between the great figures of Maine’s outdoor heritage.
Attendees are encouraged to share their stories of great adventures in the Maine woods. Brechlin’s book will be available for purchase and signing the night of the event for $18. The program is part of the library’s series Conversations about Nature. The series explores our relationship with nature.
“Return to Moose River, In Search of the Spirit of the Great North Woods,” was released this last summer by Down East Books, a division of Rowan and Littlefield. It includes more than a dozen narrative non-fiction essays chronicling adventures across the breadth of Maine, from the iconic Moose River, to the top of Mount Katahdin in Baxter State Park, Telos, to the Appalachian Trail’s 100-Mile Wilderness and Moosehead Lake, to the majestic St. Croix River on the border with New Brunswick.
Whitewater canoeing, backpacking and snowmobiling adventures are all included. Each essay focuses on the featured area’s natural and human history. For Brechlin, it is the spirits of those who have traveled Maine’s woods and waters, as much as anything, that give these areas special significance.
“We’ve done such a great job of conserving land and water in Maine, but we haven’t done as well preserving the human history and legends that populate these places,” Brechlin explains.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, but the 448-page report outlining the results of his nearly two-year investigation is chock full of interesting tidbits.
The Mueller report, which Attorney General William Barr made public on Tuesday, offers enticing behind-the-scenes details about some of the more notable events of Trump’s campaign and the early days of his presidency.
It was a joke, people!
At a news conference in July 2016, Trump encouraged Russia to hack into Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s personal emails. "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said.
But Trump told Mueller he was joking. Trump said he made the statement “in jest and sarcastically” and said it should have been apparent to “any objective observer. ”
Trump also told the special counsel that he had not been informed during the campaign of any efforts by Russia to infiltrate or hack Clinton’s emails.
But it turns out the Russians were listening.
Within about five hours of Trump's request, Russian military intelligence agents "targeted Clinton's personal office for the first time" and "sent malicious links targeting 15 email accounts," including one belonging to a Clinton aide whose name was redacted, according to the report.

Trump Tower meeting
A now-famous meeting between three senior members of Trump’s presidential campaign and a small group of Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016 fueled suspicions the Russians meddled in the presidential election.
Yet some key questions have remained unanswered: What did Trump know about the meeting? And when did he know it?
Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. , agreed to the meeting after Hollywood publicist Rob Goldstone sent him an attention-grabbing email claiming that “the Crown Prosecutor of Russia” had information to share that would incriminate Clinton “and her dealings with Russia. ”
“If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr. wrote back immediately.
But the meeting was a bust: The Russian lawyer offered just vague remarks about Russian fund-raising for Democrats and, after a few minutes, switched gears and started talking about U. S. -Russian adoption policies.
So what did Trump know? Not much, he says.
Trump told the special counsel’s office in writing that he had “no recollection” of learning about the meeting in advance. Nor did he recall knowing during the campaign that the meeting had taken place or that Trump Jr. had been in contact with Goldstone or the Russian pop star who's outreach to Goldstone was the impetus for the gathering.
Trump said he didn't even recall where he was that day, although he conceded that his calendar put him in New York City.

'It said too much'
Trump may not have known about the Trump Tower meeting in advance, but he eventually did find out about it and try to put his spin on what happened.
The Mueller report confirms news accounts that Trump personally dictated a misleading statement about what went on in the meeting.
On July 7, 2017, about six months into his presidency, Trump was in Hamburg, Germany, for the G-20 summit when his aides learned The New York Times was working on an article about the meeting.
The next day, on the flight home, Trump's communications director Hope Hicks gave the president a draft statement that was to be released by Trump Jr. , which acknowledged the meeting came about because of the possibility the Russians might have information valuable to the Trump’s campaign.
The president, however, "directed that the state not be issued because it said too much,” the Mueller report says. “The president told Hicks to say only that Trump Jr. took a brief meeting and it was about Russian adoption. ”
The final statement issued to the Times described the meeting as “a short introductory meeting” and said the participants “primarily” discussed the adoption of Russian children. It made no mention that the presidential campaign had been discussed or that the Russians had managed to get the meeting by offering to divulge dirt on Clinton.

Comey and 'what really happened'
Two days after he fired FBI director James Comey, Trump gave an interview to NBC in which he contradicted his previous statements and those of his staff on the reasons for Comey’s dismissal.
The day of the firing, the White House claimed that Comey’s termination resulted from the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy over Comey’s mishandling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.
But Trump had in fact decided to fire Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice, the Mueller report confirms.
Not happy with how his aides were spinning the story, Trump decided to give an interview to NBC’s Lester Holt, telling the White House counsel’s office in advance that “the communications team could not get the story right” and that he was going to tell Holt “what really happened,” according to the Mueller report.
Trump told Holt he decided to fire Comey in part because “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. ”

WikiLeaks blames a dead man
There's no one better to take the fall than a dead man, right?
After it released a trove of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in 2016, WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange tried to place the blame on Seth Rich, a young DNC staffer who had been murdered just a few weeks earlier.
Rich, 27, was shot to death July 10, 2016, in what Washington, D. C. police say was a random robbery attempt. But conspiracy theorists have tried to tie him to the release of thousands of DNC emails that hobbled Hillary Clinton's campaign for president.
Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements that falsely implied Rich had been the source of the stolen emails, according to the Mueller report. WikiLeaks even offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich’s killer.
Asked in an interview why he was so interested in finding Rich’s killer, Assange said, “We’re very interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged WikiLeaks sources. ”
But the Mueller report outlines what it says was an elaborate effort by the Russians to obtain the emails and says that the special counsel’s investigation discredited WikiLeaks' claims regarding the source of the stolen materials.

How tragic church fires can inspire decency in others

Texto completo: Seeing the iconic church on fire was stunning. After firefighters extinguished the inferno, the heartbreaking scenes of the charred church, which had been a beloved home for generations of her family, were almost too much for Monica Harris.
"Seeing the church in the condition it is now," the 57-year-old Christian said for a story in The New York Times, "it’s almost like losing a family member."
That loss, and the beauty destroyed by that blaze, hadn’t even had time to register before a man of the cloth added some perspective.
"They burned down a building. They didn’t burn down our spirit," he said.
The gofundme rebuilding fund for three overwhelmingly black churches burned in Louisiana in the past month had topped out under $100,000 until Monday’s fire at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris reignited the cause. None of those structures was on par with the world-famous, centuries-old, magnificent cathedral of Notre Dame, but black churches matter. As of Wednesday, online donations for the three black churches were nearing the $1.8 million goal. Donations for Notre Dame are expected to top $1 billion.
"As we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let’s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana," Hillary Clinton tweeted Tuesday. Journalist Yashar Ali and CNN anchor Jake Tapper posted similar tweets asking people to remember those black churches, too.
As the world watched the flames consuming the iconic spire of the cathedral of Notre Dame, people used words such as heartbreaking and tragic to describe the damage to the centuries-old architectural wonder, which is a monument to Christianity. But one of the first online comments I read came from a suburban Catholic priest, who noted, "This is really, tragically sad. But God is NOT confined to even beautiful and ancient structures." He went on to explain how asylum-seekers and other people suffering hardships deserve that same outpouring of empathy and assistance.
Easter celebrates the belief that Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead, the keystone of the Christian faith. But it also offers a more universal message that bad things can get better. Easter signals hope and a new start.
On the same day Notre Dame was burning, every Major League Baseball player, coach and umpire wore a No. 42 jersey to honor Jackie Robinson, the first black player allowed to play in the majors. It is heartbreaking and tragically sad that there was a time when black players were banned from the National Pastime, but in honoring Robinson, we celebrate how the world can change for the better.
At the same time, we can continue to find it heartbreaking and tragically sad that MLB now is investigating racist messages sent to Carl Edwards Jr., a relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs who got off to a bad start this season and happens to be black.
Clearly, today’s world gives us plenty of opportunities to right wrongs and make bad things better. Louisiana officials on Monday charged a 21-year-old white man with arson and hate crimes in connection with the fires set at the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, as well as the St. Mary Baptist Church in nearby Port Barre.
Every cowardly and hateful act can inspire a commitment to decency and good in others. Not only can we take some comfort in the fact nobody died in any of these tragic church fires, we can also find something good in the response of ordinary people.

Anti-union group blasts UAW with full-page ad

Texto completo: A new anti-union campaign launched Wednesday in full-page Detroit newspaper ads portrays the UAW as having a "culture of corruption" that's willing to "sell out union members."
The ads, purchased by a Washington-based group with a history of activism in Michigan and nationwide, appeared in both the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News. The message strikes at the heart of the UAW, based in Detroit and mired in an ongoing federal criminal probe tied to corruption centered at the union's joint training center with Fiat Chrysler.
Behind the campaign is the Center for Union Facts, which is described on its website as an "online empire exposing big labor." The center excerpted quotes from news articles about the corruption case, which has resulted in eight criminal convictions.
"Think the UAW has the best interests of union members in mind?" the ad asks. "Think again."
This comes just months before the UAW begins negotiating four-year wage and benefit contracts with Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler. The current contract expires in September.
The newspaper ads dovetail with the launch of a website designed specifically to undermine the credibility of the powerful UAW with sections titled, "corrupt leadership" and "lavish lifestyles" and "member neglect" and "plant closures." It names top officials with individual pages devoted to various elements of the federal lawsuit.
"For the last year, the UAW has claimed that the corruption scandal unearthed by the ongoing federal investigation is just the result of a couple of bad apples. But as the investigation continues to unfold, it's becoming obvious that there's a pervasive culture of corruption at the union that goes all the way to the top," Charlyce Bozzello, communications director for the Center for Union Facts, told the Free Press.
"The site makes that clear for union members and employees who might be considering bringing the UAW to their workplace."
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg told the Free Press that the ad is no surprise.
"For what it's worth, this is a well-known anti-worker organization," he said. "The UAW has repeatedly expressed its disappointment and efforts to adopt a clean slate reform agenda to make sure these issues never happen again."
Campaign cost: $6,800 The cost of the black and white full-page ads, for both newspapers, is $6,800, according to Charlie Hunt, regional account executive at Michigan.com.
The same ad would have cost $17,000 if run on Thursday, Friday or Sunday, which have higher circulation because they are delivered to subscribers' homes. Color ads are slightly more expensive.
This ad also comes during renewed UAW efforts to organize the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The UAW filed for an election last week and has a National Labor Relations Board hearing that potentially impacts more than 1,700 assembly workers who build the Volkswagen Passat, a midsize car, and Volkswagen Atlas, an SUV.
Rothenberg, who is based in Detroit but had traveled To Tennessee, said, "Chattanooga workers are the only VW workers in the world that don't have the right to bargain. VW workers throughout the world have unions. Why are they treated differently in Chattanooga?"
VW labor talks On Wednesday, Volkswagen told the Free Press the union situation is fluid.
"We believe we can achieve more for the company and our workers by continuing an open dialogue," said VW spokesman Mark Clothier. "For a few examples, we've heard the concerns that our workers have raised in this open dialogue and we've responded with improvements in working conditions: we've adjusted shift work, we've reduced overtime to have more predictability and we've raised wages."
Clothier added, "Nevertheless, we respect our workers' right to decide on representation and have always believed that any election for the Chattanooga plant should include both production and maintenance employees. We will now take steps to ensure that the prior maintenance-only petition is properly resolved first. As a company, and as colleagues, we will respect the decision of our team."
Taint of corruption While the UAW works to grow its ranks, most recently having seen significant growth among Las Vegas-based casino workers, the worker training corruption case risks doing long-term damage that harms the union's ability to recruit new members and retain members already paying dues.
"The statements in the ad consist of accurate quotes and facts and anti-UAW rhetoric," said Gary Klotz, a longtime employment lawyer based in Detroit.
"This is the kind of negative commentary that the UAW will be confronted with in organizing campaigns for years to come," he said.
"In addition, if more UAW officials, especially (former president) Dennis Williams and past or present UAW senior officers, are indicted and plead guilty or are convicted, the UAW will be attacked as a corrupt union by employers for a very long time in union organizing campaigns."
Klotz emphasized, "The long-term reputational damage to the UAW from this scandal will be severe."
While commonly known as the United Auto Workers, the official name is the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. It represents more than 400,000 active members in the U.S. and Canada who work in everything from casino gaming to beer production to higher education.
Despite a diverse membership, the UAW is known for its autoworkers.
Drunken drivers and puppies In addition to the UAW, the tax-exempt, nonprofit Center for Union Facts has targeted unions that represent teachers and workers employed in home care, nursing homes, hospitality, food service, manufacturing and laundry.
The organization, founded in 2006 by lobbyist Richard Berman, has run ads in Michigan, Montana, Oregon and Nevada attacking public employee unions, according to The Oregonian of Portland. The group spent big money to fend off the recall of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker during his union battles in 2012.
The group's website, which also includes activist tracking of celebrities including Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand and Betty White, is focused on curbing the influence of unions. Tax records show the group has raised millions and spent millions on national print and broadcast campaigns.
The UAW isn't the only target of Berman and Company.
The public affairs firm has created nonprofits that have challenged organizations including Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Humane Society of the United States and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, according to USA Today, the New York Times and the Baltimore Sun.

Texto completo: Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has attracted little financial support locally for her presidential bid, with just 3% of the $1.95 million she raised in the first quarter of this year coming from residents of her home state. Noticeably missing from her donor list are influential leaders in the business and political community who are known to contribute generously to local candidates.
While the lackluster financial showing at the local level is of little consequence to Gabbard’s presidential aspirations as she tours the country drumming up support and campaign contributions in key primary states. Still it could be an indication of where political support is aligning at home if she runs again next year for her congressional seat.
State Sen. Kai Kahele, who jumped into the race early, announcing in January that he would seek Gabbard’s congressional seat representing the neighbor islands and rural Oahu, has by comparison received donations from a substantial number of well-known political players and lobbyists. In total, he raised $250,000 in the first quarter, a considerable haul for a first time congressional candidate who has only held elected office for three years.
Of the $1.95 million Gabbard raised during the quarter ending March 31, about four dozen Hawaii residents contributed a total of $56,880. Among her contributors were her father and mother, state Sen. Mike Gabbard and his wife, Carol Porter Gabbard, who contributed the maximum of $2,800 each, Lois Mitsunaga of Mitsunaga & Associates and David Carey, former CEO of Outrigger Hotels.
Gabbard has trailed significantly behind her competitors in the Democratic presidential primary race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders brought in the most this quarter, with $18.2 million in individual contributions, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris with $12 million and former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke with $9.4 million. In the money race, Gabbard finished 12th among primary contenders, according to a New York Times analysis of major candidates.
While Gabbard is trailing in cash and in the national polls, her campaign recently announced that 65,000 people had donated to her presidential campaign, a mile­stone that’s expected to make her eligible to join the televised Democratic debates in June. Making the national debate stage is a significant opportunity for lesser known candidates like Gabbard.
By early next year it should be clear who the front-runners are in the Democratic primary for president, at which time Gabbard may be turning her attention back to her current seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Candidates in Hawaii can begin officially filing to run in the August 2020 congressional primary in February, with a final deadline in June 2020.
Gabbard, who didn’t respond to a request to comment for this story, has not responded to questions from the Honolulu Star-Advertiser in recent months about whether she intended to seek her congressional seat again next year. But political analysts in Hawaii have said they expect she will. And while she has trailed her opponents in fundraising so far during the presidential primary, those contributions for the most part can be transferred to her congressional campaign committee if she does bow out of the presidential primary, according to the Federal Election Commission.
In the meantime, Kahele has gotten off to an aggressive start in his campaign for the congressional seat with a donor list including such notable figures as Walter Dods, a longtime political strategist and supporter of leading Democrats. Dods is former chairman of First Hawaiian Bank and served as campaign chairman for the late U.S. Sen. Dan Inouye. Also donating to Kahele’s campaign are developer Stanford Carr; Alicia Moy, president and CEO of Hawaii Gas; Robert Nobriga, executive vice president and chief financial officer at American Savings Bank and a Kamehameha trustee; and Tim Johns, CEO of Zephyr Insurance who in the past chaired Mazie Hirono’s U.S. Senate campaign.
Kahele has also received contributions from Micah Kane, CEO of the Hawaii Community Foundation; Richard Egged, president of the Waikiki Improvement Association; William Kaneko, a partner in the Honolulu office of Denton’s; former Attorney General David Louie; Ivan Lui-Kwan, a director at Starn O’Toole Marcus & Fisher and former board chairman for the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation; and Art Ushijima, president and CEO of The Queen’s Health Systems.
“I think it shows a lot of great momentum,” said Kahele of the contributions. “I think it’s a great first start in what I view as an uphill battle and a long road ahead.”
Kahele said that while it was unconventional for him to enter the race so early, he felt that he needed to in order to attract enough money and name recognition to seriously compete.
“I really felt that the work that I would need to put in and the amount of money I would need to raise and the grassroots, organizational structure I would need to develop over all of the neighbor islands and Oahu will take up a lot of my time,” he said.
He noted that he is still flying full time as a Hawaiian Airlines pilot, attending his monthly drills with the Hawaii National Guard, serving in the state Legislature and flying back to Hilo be with his wife and young kids.
“And so this is not something I just wanted to do on a whim six months before the primary,” he said. “I knew if I was going to do this that I needed to start now.”
While Kahele has already attracted a list of influential donors, that doesn’t mean that Gabbard won’t also attract significant support if she begins campaigning locally for the House seat she has held since 2012.
And the lack of financial support among political and business leaders in Hawaii for her presidential bid doesn’t mean she is losing support among regular voters, said John Hart, chairman of the communications department of Hawaii Pacific University. Gabbard has enjoyed high popularity ratings since being elected to Congress.
“She is a Democrat,” said Hart, “but she’s really never had the support of the party establishment and has never really sought it.”

SEED &amp; BEAN BRINGS CAFE, CBD GOODIES DOWNTOWN

Texto completo: Seed & Bean Market opened quietly this month in the downtown Fort Myers space previously occupied by Rebel Coffee.
"We're using April as a soft-opening month," said Cole Peacock, who owns the cafe and market with business partners Kyle Schaid, Bruce Wendorf, Mike Smuts and Ron Greenstein.
"We'll do an official grand opening in May."
Seed & Bean is introducing the area to what Peacock calls a "new funky chill marketplace," testing out its unique concept of offering traditional coffees, teas, beers and food alongside a range of CBD-infused products.
CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a compound that occurs naturally in marijuana plants. CBD is a phytocannabinoid related to tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, another compound found in cannabis. While THC is psychoactive, making users feel high or stoned, CBD has no such effects. CBD is known for its ability to calm and relax.
Seed & Bean's products include CBD-infused cosmetics, face masks, bath bombs, lotions, transdermal patches and traditional vape pens.
"The CBD is the healing and wellness component that comes out of the plant," Peacock said. "CBD is federally approved and legal. We're not selling marijuana. We're selling CBD products."
CBD has been gaining traction lately as a treatment for a range of ailments and conditions, especially in natural wellness circles.
"It has a variety of wellness impacts on your body," Peacock said.
"People are taking it for everything from helping them go to sleep at night to anxiety to joint pain. They use if for spot irritation on their skin. Some people use it for PTSD. Often times, they use it for things they had a pre-existing condition for, and they want to take a more natural, whole-health approach. This is a great alternative for them."
Seed & Bean isn't just a CBD market.
It's also a cafe offering coffees and teas, beer from downtown's Millennial Brewing Co., plus a full menu. Some of its food offerings include shrimp and grits, panini, waffles made from hemp flour, muffins, pastries, breakfast burritos and salads with a house-made bacon vinaigrette that Peacock called "fantastic."
"Conceptually, it blends well," Peacock said of the combined marketplace and cafe.
"When you've got really good food, really clean foods, and that wellness way of life — it just kind of flows. It's a concept that marries very well together."
In addition to its regular weekday menu, Seed & Bean offers brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. Happy hour starts daily at, of course, 4:20 p.m. (a longtime code used by marijuana fans). And on April 20, that's 4/20, the shop and cafe is hosting an all-day event to introduce the community to its concept with menu specials and discounts on store products.
Seed & Bean is for everyone, Peacock said, and it looks nothing like a marijuana head shop. Instead, it provides what he calls "a CBD wellness atmosphere."
"You very easily can see people in here of any age and any lifestyle," he said. "We want anyone who wants to come."
That means people in tie-dye, people in business suits, and everyone in between.
"It's a hip, funky thing downtown," he said. "A new face, a new change, helping the city grow."

Bernie Sanders nurses 2016 grudge as he fundraises off hating on Clintonworld

Texto completo: In sign that the 2016 Democratic Primary never truly ended, Bernie Sanders is raising money off of comments by Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, who is trying to block Sanders from gaining the nomination.

Brock was among those who spoke to the New York Times for an article quoting members of the Democratic Party cautioning its primary voters against nominating a socialist in 2020.

In an email to supporters, the socialist Vermont senator, running for president as a Democrat, called Brock's comments "a serious threat to our campaign" and labeled him an impediment to the campaign's "political revolution."

"Mr. Brock — who smeared Anita Hill and who led an effort to stop our political revolution four years ago — is almost correct. They don’t just hate Bernie Sanders. They hate everything our political revolution embodies. They hate Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, breaking up big banks, free public college for all," Sanders said.

Sanders then proceeded to solicit donations citing Brock's comments "as part of our emergency 48-hour fundraising drive to fight back against the 'anti-Sanders' campaign being hatched by the financial elite of this country."

Brock admitted to the Times that he has been meeting with other party operatives about how to nix Sanders' chances for the nomination.

"There’s a growing realization that Sanders could end up winning this thing, or certainly that he stays in so long that he damages the actual winner,” Brock told the Times.

Sanders' antagonism toward Clinton and his unhappiness with the 2016 process has been a feature of his campaign.

Just last weekend, an organizer for Sanders was caught on video in an expletive-filled rant against Clinton at a rally in Warren, Mich.

"Fuck Hillary! Fuck Hillary!" Mark Craig could be heard shouting at the event. Sanders also attacked the Democratic National Committee for allowing elite Democrats to serve superdelegates, whose votes help ensure a strong establishment voice in the primary process.

“Then we said, four years ago, you know, maybe it doesn’t make a lot of sense for a small number of superdelegates at the Democratic National Convention to control the outcome,” Sanders said.

Yet other Democrats expressed concern that infighting could make the eventual nominee more vulnerable in his or her matchup against President Trump — and worried that wounds from the last Democratic presidential primary never truly healed.

"First of all, speaking to Democrats generally, I'd recommend they focus on their own messages instead of pointing their fire on one another. It's too early to start beating up on one another," Brad Bannon, a Democratic pollster, told the Washington Examiner . "On the other hand, if you're a Democratic presidential candidate you'll never miss a chance to raise money, and there's definitely an element to people who supported Bernie in 2016 who are hostile against the Clintons and the Democratic establishment."

Brock, a former GOP operative who switched parties in the 1990s and went on to be a close adviser to Clinton, has long been critical of Sanders. In March, Brock warned those within the party that "there are some very dyed-in-the-wool Democrats that wouldn't at all be enthusiastic about supporting [Sanders] in a general election," during a segment of "Hardball" on MSNBC. Those remarks also resulted in another fundraising push from the Sanders campaign.

"We saw this play out with in the GOP primary last time around, this is not a new mixtape the DJ is playing," Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright told the Washington Examiner , referring to Republican establishment anxiety about nominating Trump in 2016 . "Obviously there are some people who like Bernie who see Brock as an enemy, but these things don't happen by chance. The Sanders campaign knows what it's doing."

Texto completo: ERIC WEBB
Schitt’s Creek: Up Close & Personal. Every generation has one. No, not a vampire slayer. A warm-hearted, laugh-out-loud funny TV comedy that you can’t stop telling your friends to watch (and to stick it out because the first season is a little quiet). It used to be “Parks and Recreation”; now it’s the CBC/Pop TV series “Schitt’s Creek,” about the zany antics of a formerly rich family navigating life in the titular small town, which they once bought as a joke. Eugene Levy, Daniel Levy, Annie Murphy, Noah Reid, Emily Hampshire and eternal goddess/queen of all she surveys Catherine O’Hara will hold court at the Paramount for an insider’s look at the series some (me) are calling “the thing I watch when I want to laugh but then also dab my eyes with Kleenex.” (7 and 9:30 p.m. April 27 at Paramount)
Nick Offerman. Speaking of “Parks and Recreation” ... Offerman, the erstwhile Ron Swanson from that NBC comedy has branched out into a pretty interesting film and comedy career. He anchored the incredibly sweet music comedy “Hearts Beat Loud” in 2018 and wrote multiple New York Times bestsellers playing on his red-blooded American man image, in addition to character actor turns in too many movies to mention. Expect grizzliness, but also cuddliness. Also, he owns a wood shop! (7 and 9:30 p.m. April 24, Paramount)
Enzo Priesnitz. This local comic won the Funniest Person in Austin contest in 2017. And gotta say, truth in advertising! He also one time at Cap City Comedy Club asked me a question about my “girlfriend” from the stage (I was in the front row), and I had to tell him I was gay, and he handled it very well! (8 p.m. April 25 at Cap City Comedy Club; 10:15 p.m. April 26 at Fallout Theater; 6 p.m. April 27 at the Velv Comedy Lounge)
Matt Rogers. Oh, I do think so, honey. One half of the podcast Las Culturistas along with Bowen Yang, also one of our picks, Rogers is a rising star in the New York City comedy scene. (He won’t make it to Moontower for the podcast taping on April 26, according to the fest; comedian Joel Kim Booster will fill in with Yang.) If you like your punchlines with a side of Broadway belting, he’s for you. He also writes “RuPaul’s Drag Race” recaps for Vulture, which I cannot recommend highly enough. (8 p.m. April 27 at Palm Door on Sixth)
Amanda Seales. The self-styled “Jedi Khaleesi with a patronus that’s a Black Panther with wings” is having a real moment. She has a comedy special for HBO, “I Be Knowin’,” and is also a regular on the channel’s “Insecure.” She’s tackling race, cat-calling and oh so much more. (7 and 11:30 p.m. April 27 at Stateside)
Jenny Slate. The “Parks and Recreation” (“Money, please!”) and “Kroll Show” scene stealer is one of the greats when it comes to a funny personal story (and a funny voice to match). Google any of her late-night talk show appearances for proof. Slate’s headliner slot is a can’t-miss. (9:30 p.m. April 26, Paramount)
JOE GROSS
Vir Das. An Indian actor, comedian and musician, Das began as a stand-up, performing mostly observational stuff about relationships and Indian culture, before becoming a Hindi cinema sensation. He started to break out in America with his 2017 Netflix special, “Abroad Understanding.” He also plays Jai on action comedy “Whiskey Cavalier.” (7 and 9:30 p.m. April 24 at Stateside Theatre)
Chris Redd. One of the best additions “Saturday Night Live” has made in a good, long time, Chris Redd is just one of those guys you are always happy to see in a sketch, whether he is playing Kanye West, Sterling K. Brown or Louis Farrakhan. Check out his new album, “But Here We Are,” on CC Records. (Redd headlines a show that starts at 9:30 pm. at the Parish April 26 with Eliza Skinner, Mike Vecchione and Bryson Brown. Opening for David Spade 7 p.m. April 25 at Paramount; 7:30 p.m. April 25 at Antone’s Nightclub; 8 p.m. April 25 at the Parish; 8 p.m. April 26 at the Velv Comedy Lounge; 9:30 p.m. April 26 at the Parish as headliner; 11:30 p.m. April 26 at Stateside Theatre; 6 p.m. April 27 at Speakeasy; 9:30 p.m. April 27 at 800 Congress; 10 p.m. April 27 at Palm Door on Sixth)
SHARON CHAPMAN
Nicole Byer. What a treat, what a dream. Nicole Byer truly is one of the funniest people working right now — and she works a lot; her credits are too many to list. If you only know her as host of “Nailed It,” well, that’s some G-rated fun, but you need to check out her stand up, which is way more for adults, and her podcast, “Why Won’t You Date Me?” (10:15 p.m. April 25 at Palm Door on Sixth; 11:30 p.m. April 25 at Stateside Theatre; 8 p.m. April 26 at Palm Door on Sixth; 7:30 p.m. April 27 at 800 Congress; 10 p.m. April 27 at Palm Door on Sixth)
Jon Glaser. We come back again to “Parks and Recreation,” which gave us Glaser’s politician we loved to hate (“You’ve been Jammed!”), and then we say a quick and sad “hi” to Laird on “Girls.” Glaser is everywhere, making appearances on “Inside Amy Schumer” and various late-night shows, creating his own TV shows, voicing characters (“Bob’s Burgers” and “Aqua Teen Hunger Force,” to name just two), and writing and directing (books and music videos!). (9:30 p.m. April 25 at Stateside; 8 p.m. April 26 at Speakeasy)
KELSEY BRADSHAW
Taylor Tomlinson. Tomlinson, who you may know from her appearances on “The Tonight Show,” “Conan” and Netflix’s “The Comedy Lineup,” feels like your older sister telling you how it is. I don’t have an older sister, but I imagine she would let me know that, hey, your 20s aren’t all they’re cracked up to be and dating is weird. She started doing standup at 16 and will be putting in work during the festival, so make sure not to miss her. (7:30 p.m. April 25 at Antone’s Nightclub; 11:30 p.m. April 25 at Stateside Theatre; 8 p.m. April 26 at the Velv Comedy Lounge; 10 p.m. April 26 at Palm Door on Sixth; 7:30 p.m. April 27 at 800 Congress; 8 p.m. April 27 at the Velv Comedy Lounge; 10 p.m. April 27 at Palm Door on Sixth)
Emma Willmann. Willmann, fresh off her run on “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” playing a not-crazy girlfriend, is really, really funny. She’s appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and Netflix’s “The Comedy Lineup.” I watched her quick set on the latter and was hooked. Maybe you will be, too — she’s performing seven times during Moontower. (8:15 p.m. April 25 at Palm Door on Sixth; 8:30 p.m. April 25 at Fallout Theater; 10:30 p.m. April 25 at Fallout Theater; opening for Ronny Chieng, 7 p.m. April 26 at Stateside Theatre; 9:30 p.m. April 26 at Townsend Stage; 8:30 p.m. April 27 at Fallout Theater; 9:30 p.m. April 27 at 800 Congress)
Bowen Yang. He’s got the range. Yang has taken on Meryl Streep’s Miranda Priestly from “The Devil Wears Prada” and Sandra Oh’s Christina Yang from “Grey’s Anatomy” in viral lip-syncing videos. He recently stepped in as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on an episode of “Saturday Night Live,” where he is a writer. You’ll have six chances to see the Brooklyn-based comedian at Moontower this year, where he’ll also be recording an episode of Las Culturistas, his podcast with comedian Matt Rogers. (8:15 p.m. April 25 at Palm Door on Sixth; 6 p.m. April 26 at Speakeasy; 9:45 p.m. April 26 at Antone’s Nightclub; 7:30 p.m. April 27 at 800 Congress; 8 p.m. April 27 at Palm Door on Sixth; 9:30 p.m. April 27 at 800 Congress)
PHIL JANKOWSKI
Nate Bargatze. Fresh off the release of his hour-long Netflix special, “The Tennessee Kid,” it’s hard to continue calling the clean and relatable Bartgatze an up-and-comer. He is here. (9:30 p.m. April 25 at Paramount Theatre as headliner)
Off Book. Zach Reino and Jessica McKenna bring their improvised musical podcast to the stage. You read right: It is a completely original improvised musical. (6 p.m. April 27 at Speakeasy)

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump’s sister retired recently as a federal appellate judge, it illuminated the need to change the rules for judicial ethics investigations.
Former Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, 82, was appointed to a U.S. District Court in New Jersey by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, Philadelphia, by President Bill Clinton in 1999.
After The New York Times reported extensively last year on suspect dealings involving Trump family real estate businesses, in which the judge had a share, several people filed ethics complaints against her. The complaints were assigned for investigation to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, New York.
Under federal rules, the ethics investigation ended when Barry resigned, meaning that she can collect her full judicial pension without a resolution to the ethics complaints.
She is not alone. In December 2017, for example, multiple sexual harassment complaints against Appellate Judge Alex Kozinski of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ended when he retired.
The Supreme Court should amend the rule to ensure that ethics investigations of federal judges are completed, since they involve the judges’ conduct while in office, rather than rendered irrelevant by retirements.

In rebuilding Notre Dame, Europe can renew its soul

Texto completo: As the world mourns the destruction of a large part of Notre Dame, we should nonetheless hope and pray that the project of rebuilding it will also inspire the regeneration of faith and religion in a spiritually moribund Western Europe.

For the better part of a decade, thinkers on the Right have warned repeatedly that Western Europe is committing “cultural suicide.” Among the commonly cited indices are the rapid rise in immigration of nonacculturating Muslims, the feeble economic growth (apart from Germany and Great Britain) surely caused in part by welfare-state habits, and the frighteningly declining birth rates of native Europeans.

Underlying all of these, though, is the remarkable decline of both organized religion and of more amorphously defined religious “faith” in the cultural heart of what was known as “Christendom” (or, more broadly, of Judeo-Christian civilization). It is sickeningly ironic, for example, that the same French people who love their cathedral do not find much relevance in the god the cathedral was built to honor.

Only 18% of today’s French describe themselves as “church-attending Christians.” Another 46% say they are nonpracticing Christians, and 36% are “unaffiliated” or “other.” So, for some 82% of the French, not even the glories of their Gothic cathedral can lead them to think Paris is worth a mass.

The percentages of practicing Christians are even worse in six other of the largest 15 nations in Western Europe, and the proportions of those completely unaffiliated or “other” are higher in four of them. Indeed, France’s percentages of faithless or nonpracticing (semi-)believers are almost exactly the median for all of Western Europe.

Faithlessness is growing in the United States, too, but as Pew Research reports, “while secularization is evident on both sides of the Atlantic, unaffiliated Americans are much more likely than their counterparts in Europe to pray and to believe in God, just as U.S. Christians are considerably more religious than Christians across Western Europe. In fact, by some of these standard measures of religious commitment, American ‘nones’ are as religious as — or even more religious than — Christians in several European countries, including France, Germany and the UK.”

This void of faith in Western Europe is an epic tragedy. It makes substantially more likely the scourges of deep unhappiness and of civic disengagement. In turn, civic disengagement leads to decline in civic, economic, and physical health. A polity whose people lack faith is, in the long run, likely to be less stable, less compassionate, and less free.

As the culturally astute Rod Dreher wrote, “Europe has lived through Christianity, and has largely discarded it. … [Europeans] consider themselves virtuous in sending Christianity into history’s dustbin. What they don’t comprehend is that in so doing, they are cutting their own national throats as people who presumably would like to preserve liberal democracy.”

Those are all, in some sense, utilitarian concerns. They are, of course, important. Still, even those considerations pale in comparison to the calamity that is the loss of faith itself. God, as first mover and as caring guide and intervenor in our lives, is the entity greater and more loving than ourselves who, if not recognized and loved in return, leaves us incalculably bereft of meaning, purpose, and perspective.

Notre Dame, for all its wonders, was not a testament to human magnificence. It was an homage to our loving God. In the words of New York Times columnist Pamela Druckerman, “Notre-Dame’s hulking, Gothic presence has long suggested that there is something mysterious and unknowable at the center of it all.”

The horrid fire at Notre Dame draws attention not just to the building but to its purpose. As people around the world rush to donate money for its reconstruction, a task French President Emmanuel Macron promises to complete within five years, they ought to realize that a cathedral’s worth lies not in its physical characteristics but in its other-directed meaning. God is quite literally wonder-full, and worthy of the most grand and beautiful tribute that human ingenuity and artfulness can create.

Rebuilding Notre Dame should not be an act of mere engineering. It should be a renewing, and renewable, act of deepest faith.

Texto completo: CIA Director Gina Haspel was briefing President Trump shortly after she took over the agency when the president became distracted by flies swarming around the Oval Office.

After leaving the meeting, Haspel sent Trump flypaper, according to the New York Times.

The gesture was described by the publication as one of the ways Haspel has used her observational spy skills to connect with the president who is often dismissive of the intelligence community.

It was also another instance of Trump becoming distracted by the insects during meetings in the Oval Office.

The Washington Post reported in 2017 Trump once asked his then-chief of staff Reince Priebus to kill a fly buzzing overhead.

The West Wing has a regular issue with flies.

During the Obama years, anti-insect lights were installed in the National Security Council suite and lower press office. Staffers were given fly swatters. Former President Barack Obama himself even chased down the insects.

Most people don’t realize they got a tax cut, and the press actually wonders why

Texto completo: “Face It: You (Probably) Got a Tax Cut,” New York Times reporters Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley said this weekend in a headline conveying exasperation.

That members of the media are mystified that the general public does not realize it got a tax break in 2018 is a bit rich, considering the role the news media played in demonizing the law that created the apparently little-known tax cuts.

Casselman and Tankersley write, “Ever since President Trump signed the Republican-sponsored tax bill in December 2017, independent analyses have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law. Preliminary data based on tax filings has shown the same.”

Put in plainer terms, “Most people got a tax cut,” they report, adding that, “Taxes were down, on average, in every state.”

Roughly 65% of Americans paid less last year because of tax reform, while a much, much smaller 6% paid more, according to the Tax Policy Center. The tax-preparation group H&R Block also said that roughly two-thirds of its returning customers paid less in taxes in 2018 than they did in the previous year.

The general public, however, does not appear to realize any of this.

In fact, only 40% of Americans believe they got a tax cut, while a much smaller 20% say they are certain they got one, according to new data compiled for the Times by SurveyMonkey. A separate NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows only 17% of Americans believe their taxes will be lower following the successful passage of the GOP tax reform bill, while a much larger 28% say they believe they will “pay more.” Twenty-seven percent in the same poll say they believe they will “pay about the same” in taxes in 2018, while 28% say they “don’t know enough.”

The widespread perception that the tax law did not lead to cuts is rather astonishing, considering it is the opposite of reality. So, who is to blame for misleading the public? The Times points an accusing finger at Democratic lawmakers and liberal activist groups. I would suggest the newspaper also take a look at the mirror, as the media was more than happy to amplify, or participate in, partisan opposition to the tax law.

The opinion sections of the Times and the Washington Post, for example, have pumped out articles with headlines like, “A Tax Plan to Turbocharge Inequality, in 3 Charts,” “Apparently Republicans want to kick the middle class in the face,” and “Yes, the Senate GOP tax plan would cause ‘thousands’ to die.”

MSNBC has provided a platform to a nearly endless string of anti-tax reform activists, including former Republican policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, who alleged in 2017 the tax reform bill is, “akin to rape. It really is."

Let’s not forget that there was an entire news cycle this year revolving around reporters seizing on incomplete filing data to claim, inaccurately, that tax refunds were smaller in 2018.

“Get ready for an unhappy tax surprise,” Yahoo Finance announced in a headline that, in retrospect, seems pretty stupid. Speaking of retroactively bad takes, this New Yorker op-ed, titled “No, the Media Has Not Been Unfair to the GOP Tax Bill,” also seems disingenuous, if not outright dishonest, considering the tax bill did not jump-start the apocalypse as newsrooms claimed it would, or even rape anyone.

If we want to talk about who has been fair throughout the entirety of the tax reform news cycle, I would suggest we start with the people who actually delivered on their promises. That excludes most of the national press.

What separates Assange from the ranks of real journalists

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador’s interior minister.
Assange’s behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he’s a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans — including many in the U.S. media — long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange’s publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first?
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone’s personal emails and under what circumstances? One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn’t accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government’s decadeslong campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham’s bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts — all while risking great personal and financial loss — was epic.
Assange’s process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole — and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal — and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg’s charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
WikiLeaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that’s just me.

Texto completo: Aunque en redes sociales hay mensajes de júbilo de fanáticos y miembros del Estado Islámico ( ISIS ) sobre el incendio masivo que consumió gran parte de la catedral de Notre Dame en París , las autoridades indican que no están tratando el hecho como un “acto deliberado”, sino como un accidente.
Las investigaciones formales del siniestro comenzaron, reportó el New York Times, que indicó que los primeros reportes indican que el histórico inmueble permanece estructuralmente sano, pero la conflagración que destruyó el techo de madera y plomo y la aguja de encaje también dejó tres agujeros en el amplio techo abovedado. Insistieron en que no se indaga un atentado.
“Nada en esta etapa sugiere un acto voluntario” , dijo el fiscal de París, Rémy Heitz , quien señaló que la indagatoria será “larga y compleja”, e insistió que, por el momento, estaban considerando el desastre como un accidente.
El Times indicó que las autoridades destinaron a casi 50 investigadores, quienes se enfocarán en entrevistar a los trabajadores que habían abandonado el sitio, pero que habían participado en la restauración de la catedral poco antes de que se desatara el incendio .
Son varias la preguntas que han surgido, sobre todo si el siniestro pudo haberse evitado, pero es una respuesta difícil de dar, aunada a la incógnita de la verdadera causa.
“Los investigadores enfrentaron la difícil tarea de determinar una causa en la aparente ausencia de evidencia, destruida por las llamas que estallaron en el ‘bosque’ (como se le conocía), el marco de madera de vigas antiguas debajo del techo de plomo”, indicó el diario.

Media provides a distorted portrayal of Venezuela

Texto completo: Backed by a chorus of U.S. corporate media singing in unison, the Trump administration has prepared the American people to believe that the United States is going to do whatever it takes to rescue the suffering people of Venezuela from their despotic and incompetent ruler, Nicolas Maduro.
The media behavior is quite stunning really, unless you happen to recall that the national media always respond this way when government propaganda prepares the public for a U.S. war or other form of intervention - from Vietnam and Central America to Afghanistan, Iraq, and many others.
From Fox News on the right spewing Trumpian rhetoric about the "failed socialism" of Venezuela to the New York Times, MSNBC and New Yorker on the so-called "left" side of the spectrum, the media have been cheerleading for what amounts to a Big Lie from this and previous administrations. Anyone wishing to examine the media chorus can check the media watch-dog www.fair.org and review any of its few dozen articles that document mass media coverage on Venezuela.
Let us first acknowledge that, yes, the Maduro administration, and to a lesser degree its predecessor under Hugo Chavez, has been increasingly authoritarian, suppressing opposition forces. Arguably, too, there has been mismanagement of the state-owned oil producer (PDVSA) and corruption among government officials. And, although the reasons are understandable, Chavez erred in failing to diversify Venezuela's economy when oil was such a rich resource.
But we need to be clear about a few things. This is not about authoritarian government in Venezuela.
The United States has over the decades supported scores of authoritarian regimes - consider, for example, that bastion of human rights, Saudi Arabia. Readers might check William Blum's documentation of case after case in his book, "Killing Hope." This is not about bringing democracy to Venezuela. And very importantly, it is not about bringing aid to the suffering people of Venezuela.
No, instead, the U.S. has engaged in economic warfare against Venezuela going back into the Barack Obama administration, and, prior to that, staged a brief coup against Chavez during the George W. Bush years. Donald Trump has sharply escalated the U.S. effort to strangle the Venezuelan economy through devastating sanctions and a financial embargo.
For U.S. policymakers, the Venezuelan government's cardinal sin has for years been that, in defiance of the United States, it used its ample oil revenue to provide the Venezuelan poor and working classes with a better life while also providing aid to other Latin American governments to free them from the boot of "Yankee Imperialism," i.e., centuries of U.S. hegemony over "our backyard."
As documented by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, poverty and extreme poverty declined precipitously under Chavez. Inequality, unemployment and infant mortality all fell significantly. The economy nearly doubled and the private sector grew faster than the public sector.
After Chavez's death, global oil prices dropped radically, severely straining the Venezuelan economy. Then, claiming Venezuela was "an extraordinary threat to U.S. national security," the Obama administration imposed sanctions that made it more difficult for Venezuela to attract investment and financing.
Meanwhile, the U.S. actively supported opposition groups through the so-called National Endowment for Democracy, a government funded organization with a record of working for regime change in "unfriendly" countries. Along with other opposition groups, the U.S. was grooming a young right-winger named Juan Guaido to this end.
The five separate Trump administration sanction orders have all but eliminated Venezuela's ability to produce oil for export in order to provide revenue for public needs. Indeed, the nation's economy is being strangled, and food and medicine shortages are increasing public desperation. Hence, the U.S. named Guaido as Venezuela's "legitimate" interim president and announced $20 million in U.S. "humanitarian aid."
The media provided unending visuals to back up administration claims about the heartless Maduro blocking aid for his people - what was in fact a publicity stunt designed to wean military supporters away from Maduro.
I believe the real aims of U.S. policy toward Venezuela are: 1) to gain control over Venezuelan oil reserves, the largest in the world, 2) to reassert U.S. domination over all of Latin America, after bringing about rightist regimes in Honduras, Brazil and Paraguay, and 3) to ensure that other nations do not seek a form of economic development independent of the U.S. neoliberal model.

Pulitzer judges: ‘Not one anywhere close to a conservative'

Texto completo: Here’s a prediction about today’s anticipated Pulitzer Prize announcement: Stories questioning the 2016 Trump campaign’s “collusion” with Russians won’t be on the list of winners.

That’s because the board that presides over the judging process leans heavily liberal and the history of winners in the Trump era favors his critics, including those who got the collusion story wrong.

Consider last year’s distinguished reporting award to the Washington Post and New York Times. The Pulitzer read: “For deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the president-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration.”

And of the 18 members on the board, sometimes dubbed "the deciders," there are no notable conservatives, but several famous liberals and Trump critics.

Standouts include Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, himself a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize who also writes for the New Yorker. The Pulitzer homepage features this from one of his New Yorker pieces, “President Trump, for all his demagoguery, has yet to marginalize professional reporting. In many newsrooms, investigative journalism is enjoying a renaissance, and it is having a strong impact, within and beyond Washington.”

There’s Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, a Pulitzer winner and regular Trump critic on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe." From a recent column, “The president of the United States gave a rambling and incoherent two-hour speech in which he raved like a lunatic and told crazy, self-serving lies from start to finish. If that no longer qualifies as alarming, we’re in serious trouble.”

There are a few judges who keep their opinions in check, like Neil Brown, president of the Poynter Institute and the AP’s John Daniszewski, vice president and editor at large for standards.

But in a review, the conservative media watchdog Media Research Center found nobody from the center-right.

“If this isn't the ultimate evidence of the left — and far left — dominance of the so-called ‘news media,’ what is?” asked L. Brent Bozell, president of the center.

“Eighteen judges and not one — let this sink in — not one anywhere close to a conservative. The Pulitzer Prizes have always been liberal, but this is now not just leftist, it is a mockery of itself. And then they wonder why they're not trusted to tell the truth,” he added.

The prize will be awarded today at 3 p.m.

Texto completo: Sydney Paige Monfries , una estudiante de 22 años, cayó de más de 12 metros de altura por querer tomarse una “selfie” panorámica de Nueva York, desde la torre del reloj de la Universidad de Fordham.
Los hechos ocurriero el domingo en la madrugada, alrededor de las 2:00 a.m., cuando la joven –becaria de la revista InStyle y estudiante de periodismo– y otros compañeros subieron a la torre, a pesar de que estaba prohibido.
Ella era asidua a las selfies, como se puede ver sus perfil de Facebook, pero el domingo murió, tras caer al interior de la torre, tuvo una fractura craneoencefálica, incluso los paramédicos lograron resucitarla en el lugar, pero la joven originaria de Portland, Oregón, murió más tarde en el hospital.

“Con gran tristeza informo que Sydney Monfries, estudiante del Fordham College en Rose Hill, murió hoy después de sufrir una caída dentro de la torre del Reloj Keating en las primeras horas de la mañana. Nuestros corazones están con los padres de Sydney, su familia y amigos” , escribió el presidente de la escuela, Joseph McShane . “No hay palabras suficientes para describir la pérdida de alguien tan joven y lleno de promesas, y solo semanas antes de la graduación”.
El funcionario académico indicó la joven recibirá una licenciatura póstuma, la cual entregarán a los padres.
La torre es un lugar prohibido para los jóvenes, pero eso no ha detenido a los estudiantes curiosos de echar un vistazo.
“Es como una cosa de alto nivel ir al edificio más popular del campus” , dijo Priscilla Morales, una estudiante de psicología, al New York Times. “Recientemente supimos que la puerta estaba abierta o se encontró un acceso. Por lo general, van tarde por la noche alrededor de la 1 o 2 a.m. para beber y disfrutar la vista”.

It's time to spring clean your finances, too

Texto completo: Think of making a budget like spring-cleaning: It's a great way to get things in order around your house, and you'll feel so much better after it's done.
I know lots of people think of a budget as something that limits freedom. (I know because I was one of them.) But just like getting all those old clothes out of a closet and into a yard sale or finally Marie Kondo-ing your kitchen cupboards, there's a sense of relief once it's done. Both spring cleaning and budgeting give you freedom and space to do more of what you want to do.
Here are three things to remember that will make budgeting and spring cleaning much easier:
1. Tackle one area at a time
Don't think you have to clean the entire house in one fell swoop. Pick a small room to start and go after it. Once you have a little task done, go on to something larger. Same goes for your budget. Don't focus on saving 15 percent of your income or tens of thousands for your kids' college fund — that gets overwhelming fast. Start with Baby Step 1: Get $1,000 saved for emergencies. Then, tackle each Baby Step as you get there. For more on the Baby Steps, go to rachelcruze.com.
2. Start with a small task
If you begin cleaning and organizing in your bedroom, do something small and simple like cleaning out a drawer to get yourself into a work groove and see some progress. Just like budgeting for your debt snowball where you target one debt at a time (starting with the smallest), this approach will get you motivated to clean the rest of the rooms in your house.
Here's the next small thing to check off your list. It couldn't be easier to make sure your family, your savings, and your identity are covered with the right insurance policies. Take this 5-Minute Coverage Checkup to see what you need and what you don't: daveramsey.com/coverage-checkup.
3. Give yourself plenty of time
You don't need to have a schedule that would make the hosts of Hoarders beg for a rest. Set a timetable for yourself for each task. It's your house, so that means you get to operate on your clock. There's no need to compare your progress to anyone else's — and no need to think you're not winning because you're not at their level. Same goes for your progress as you budget, save money, and pay down debt.

Texto completo: Think of making a budget like spring-cleaning: It's a great way to get things in order around your house, and you'll feel so much better after it's done.
I know lots of people think of a budget as something that limits freedom. (I know because I was one of them.) But just like getting all those old clothes out of a closet and into a yard sale or finally Marie Kondo-ing your kitchen cupboards, there's a sense of relief once it's done. Both spring cleaning and budgeting give you freedom and space to do more of what you want to do.
Here are three things to remember that will make budgeting and spring cleaning much easier:
1. Tackle one area at a time
Don't think you have to clean the entire house in one fell swoop. Pick a small room to start and go after it. Once you have a little task done, go on to something larger. Same goes for your budget. Don't focus on saving 15 percent of your income or tens of thousands for your kids' college fund — that gets overwhelming fast. Start with Baby Step 1: Get $1,000 saved for emergencies. Then, tackle each Baby Step as you get there. For more on the Baby Steps, go to rachelcruze.com.
2. Start with a small task
If you begin cleaning and organizing in your bedroom, do something small and simple like cleaning out a drawer to get yourself into a work groove and see some progress. Just like budgeting for your debt snowball where you target one debt at a time (starting with the smallest), this approach will get you motivated to clean the rest of the rooms in your house.
Here's the next small thing to check off your list. It couldn't be easier to make sure your family, your savings, and your identity are covered with the right insurance policies. Take this 5-Minute Coverage Checkup to see what you need and what you don't: daveramsey.com/ coverage-checkup.
3. Give yourself plenty of time
You don't need to have a schedule that would make the hosts of Hoarders beg for a rest. Set a timetable for yourself for each task. It's your house, so that means you get to operate on your clock. There's no need to compare your progress to anyone else's — and no need to think you're not winning because you're not at their level. Same goes for your progress as you budget, save money, and pay down debt.
You may feel like your house and money situation are both in a mess — and who hasn't at one time or another? That's totally normal. But the good news is, both situations can change starting right now.

How to avoid another Trump-like president

Texto completo: Rather than focus on the corruption, incompetence and lack of civility in the current administration, we must change the narrative in 2020. Not only must Trump be defeated, but any possibility of a similar administration being elected must be avoided.
Could a future president embrace toxic policies and practices such as those of the last three years? Who knows? But why take a chance?
Caucuses can make invaluable contributions in this regard. In vetting possible candidates, the caucuses can demand adherence to strict requirements. Candidates seeking support in 2020 should be required to disclose information and adhere to guidelines that caucuses set.
Here are several requirements the caucuses should impose on each candidate as a prerequisite for support:
Submit a job application for the presidency that includes the candidate's specific skills, experience and temperament that correlate with the demands of the presidency.
Agree to due diligence investigations designed to identify "red flags" that might result in subsequent scandals or disqualifications. Included would be releases of at least five years of federal and state tax returns, university transcripts, and records relating to civil and criminal matters involving the candidate or any entity with which he or she is associated.
Pledge to "conduct the campaign and any subsequent administration with civility." The candidate would define civility and agree to embrace dignity and respect in dealing with the press, other candidates, and opposing political parties and interests.
Pledge to fully vet campaign and future administration employees to ensure all personnel, including any family members, are qualified for their positions.
Pledge to enhance current ethics standards as applied to the candidate and all personnel associated with them. All associated with the candidate must agree not to attempt to profit from their work with the candidate/administration for at least three years.
Provide a list of the candidate's five most important policy proposals. Each policy should include specific goals, objectives and implementation steps, as well as a summary of not less than three pages.
Finally, candidates must specify how they will hold themselves accountable for implementing their platforms — in essence, provide a report card on their progress with each policy. Credible national news organizations, including the Des Moines Register, New York Times, NPR, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and others would be encouraged to opine on the content of these platforms and the feasibility and ramifications of implementing such approaches.
These proposals may be viewed as naive by some, but that's OK. They are a start. If the caucuses flex their muscles and see themselves as the first step in a disciplined hiring process, progress will have been made.

Texto completo: Craig has worked as a lawyer in Washington, D.C., since the 1970s and also served as President Bill Clinton's director of policy planning from 1997 to 1998. He served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010.
A one-time White House counsel to President Barack Obama has been charged with lying and concealing information from federal authorities in a case that stemmed from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
The case centers on Gregory Craig's work for the Ukranian government in 2012 as part of an illicit lobbying effort by Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chair.
Those who lobby on behalf of foreign governments are required to register with the Justice Department. The accusation is that Craig did not and also repeated his lies about his involvement to Mueller's team of investigators in 2017.
Craig's attorneys have called the government action an abuse of power.
"Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion," a joint statement from Craig's attorneys said.
Craig has worked as a lawyer in Washington, D.C., since the 1970s and also served as President Bill Clinton's director of policy planning from 1997 to 1998. He served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010.
Before moving to the nation's capital, Craig spent time in Vermont.
He's called Vermont his home state Despite being born in Norfolk, Virginia, Craig's family moved to Vermont after spending time in Kansas and California.
The family, who had three other boys, settled in Middlebury, where Greg's father, William G. Craig, went to college.
In a 2008 New York Times interview profiling future members of President Obama's administration, Craig said he considered Vermont to be his home state.
Father attended Middlebury College The elder Craig captained an undefeated football team at Middlebury College, a private liberal arts college that has played football since 1893. As his father put it, the team never had a huddle, signal or a "coach-scout in the press box to telephone the bench of every play."
Craig Sr. was the team's captain. He played right end and blocked a punt in the fourth quarter of his team's season opener. They went on to post an 8-0 record, the first undefeated record in school history.
Dad lost Vermont governor's race By the time Gregory Craig was working as a lawyer in Washington, D.C., his father had become chancellor for the Vermont State Colleges, a position he held from 1973 to 1976. According to a 2005 San Diego Union-Tribune article, his wife, Lorenza Craig, said he lacked support from the Statehouse.
"He felt they didn't understand the needs of higher education," Lorenza Craig said.
So he declared his candidacy for governor, running as a Republican on a platform to increase support for higher education in 1976. He lost in the primary to the eventual winner of the governorship, Richard Snelling. It was the first of five times Snelling would be elected the state's governor.
Snelling also beat out Bernie Sanders for the office that year. Sanders ran as a Liberty Union Party candidate, a political party the developed out of the anti-Vietnam War movement. Sanders resigned from the party in 1977, but in 1981, Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington for the first of four terms during the decade.
Craig has worked as a lawyer in Washington, D.C., since the 1970s and also served as President Bill Clinton's director of policy planning from 1997 to 1998. He served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010.

George Conway escalates attack on Trump's mental state

Texto completo: George Conway, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's husband, gave another scathing evaluation of President Trump's mental state Saturday evening.

The president criticized the New York Times on Twitter, accusing the outlet of false reporting on immigration to make him look bad. He then jumped to the 2016 election, claiming the Times "had to beg" for forgiveness from subscribers for its campaign coverage, apologized to him, and then moved on to "even worse, really corrupt reporting."

In response, Mother Jones journalist David Corn tweeted, "Once again, does he know he’s lying? Probably, right?" Conway replied to Corn, saying Trump's mind is a mess.

"Lies, half-truths, exaggerations, distortions, misrcollections [sic], ignorant misconceptions, wishful thinking, things that randomly pop into his mind that he thinks sound good at any particular moment, random babble—all of [these] things swirl around in his head in an endless jumble," Conway tweeted. "What’s true and what’s not—and what’s consistent with what he’s said previously and what’s not—really doesn’t matter to him. He finds no shame in being caught in a lie, so why should he distinguish truth from falsity in his own mind?"

Conway also reacted to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un commenting on how he didn't think Trump administration was prepared for his second summit with Trump in Vietnam earlier this year. "It’s amazing to think that we’ve reached a point where it’s difficult to say who has more credibility—the President of the United States or the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea," Conway said.

Conway, a conservative lawyer who is a vocal critic of Trump, ensnared headlines last month when he repeatedly questioned the president's mental health.

Responding to a frenzy of tweets from the president on a variety of subjects, ranging from the possibility of a federal investigation into “Saturday Night Live” to criticizing the late Sen. John McCain, Conway said, “His condition is getting worse."

Conway then suggested Trump has narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder by tweeting out their respective pages from the fifth edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association .

The president reacted to Conway's tweet-critiques with umbrage.

"George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!" Trump tweeted last month. Although Trump and his associates have suggested George Conway was either fired, quit, or rejected from a job at the Justice Department, he claims that he turned down a position at the agency heading the civil division because of Trump’s attacks on agency leaders and the firing of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.

The pointed tweet from Trump came just after Conway told the Washington Post he attacks the president on Twitter so he doesn’t “end up screaming” at his wife. He later called Trump the "worst kind of dumb."

Meanwhile, Kellyanne Conway defended her boss.

“He left it alone for months out of respect for me,” Kellyanne told Politico last month. “But you think he shouldn’t respond when somebody, a non-medical professional accuses him of having a mental disorder? You think he should just take that sitting down?”

“Don't play psychiatrist any more than George should be,” she added. “You're not a psychiatrist and he's not, respectfully.”

Trump, 72, received good health news after his annual physical in February. “While the reports and recommendations are still being finalized, I am happy to announce the President of the United States is in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond,” a statement from White House doctor Sean Conley said.

PULITZER PRIZE WINNER PLUMBS IMPACT OF THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM IN ELEGANT DEFENSE'

Texto completo: The biological system charged with preserving human life, diversity and reproduction is also the instrument which will kill the majority of us.
It's one of the paradoxes that fascinates Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Matt Richtel in his new book, "An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of The Immune System" (William Morrow, $28.99, 409 pages).
The San Francisco-based Richtel has written several thrillers, but his first nonfiction outing, 2014's "A Deadly Wandering," about distracted-driving, combined compelling human narratives with in-depth science writing. He is a reporter for The New York Times, the creator and former writer of the daily comic strip "Rudy Park" and has appeared on NPR and PBS NewsHour.
Subtitled "A Tale in Four Lives," "Elegant Defense" examines the immune system's history and future through the lens of science, records and research and the case histories of four individuals. It describes the wide umbrella of the immune system's astonishing domain: HIV, diabetes, asthma, colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, cancer, infections, fever, overprescribed antibiotics, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and other vital components. Despite the topic's staggering complexity and the extensive information in Richtel's fact-filled coverage, the heart and fine craft of a storyteller emerges most memorably throughout the book.
"I love fiction," Richtel said. "I deeply appreciate story that moves. I love nonfiction when it has momentum. When I read a book that's dryly factual, one that feels more like white paper than story, I cannot engage with it."
Richtel's book includes the personal accounts of two women who suffer hard-to-diagnose autoimmune diseases, a miracle HIV survivor and Jason Greenstein, a close friend of Richtel's whose episodic battle with cancer entails both a celebratory "festival of life" and a grim foreshadowing of inevitable mortality.
"What the stories do is show you the nuance; what science looks like in real life. They're my favorite parts to write," Richtel said.
The emotions and struggles of the people featured in his book are a "big crayon box of colors," Richtel said, and their stories "exploded" into his hands and helped flesh out the science.
"I get to see that everybody is their own Ferrari. Science takes me under the hood, but first I get to see them drive, hear them sing their own opera," he said.
It's not accidental that Richtel, a guitar player and songwriter, mentions music. Self-described as "scrappy and fiercely joyful" in his nonwriting pursuits tennis, singing, espresso-drinking and activities with his wife, Stanford neurologist Meredith Barad, and their two children Richtel finds his greatest bliss in words well chosen, spartan language that avoids clichés and celebrates storytelling.
"Whether I write a song or prose, I'm trying to have the language be consistent with the story, engaging to the audience, but reflective of the core emotion I'm trying to communicate," he said.
Recalling childhood years in Boulder, Colorado, he finds possible origins for his interest in the immune system and wellness. Richtel's father ran marathons and favored trail mix, he said, and "I had a mom who was an insanely early adopter of what is now seen as a very thoughtful approach to health. In two words: carob chips. We didn't have sugar, soda. She thought eating healthy, getting rest were extremely important. She only violated that herself by buying double stuff Oreos and sneak-eating them at night. We'd conduct special ops searches for them."
In the new book, Richtel tells not merely facts about the immune system, but how it plays out for him and in the lives of Jason, Bob, Linda and Merredith. "The narrative arc of the book is that we all die," he said. "That scares the publisher because what sells books is, I'm going to tell you to eat this one thing, and you're going to live longer.' This book isn't the magic pill. I offer the reader a bitter pill. How to live with more peace and happiness, but not forever. The stories are about the realness of living and, in some cases, dying."
Which is not to say Richtel avoids offering advice: foremost is getting enough sleep. "If there's a single tool you have, it's sleep. It can take its toll if you compromise it," he warns. Also, handle raw meat cautiously, due to its many pathogens; avoid super-boosting the immune system, which can trigger autoimmunity, allergies and other diseases; engage in exercise; follow a balanced diet and practice stress reduction.
Up next for Richtel is "The Man Who Wouldn't Die," a comedic neo-noir novel set in San Francisco and so unusual that William Morrow will publish it in August under a pen name, A.B. Jewell. "They said we love it, but it doesn't fit your brand,' whatever that means, so they'll use a pen name. I said, Hey, have a ball.'"
When beginning a new project, he says he must believe, "I will create something brilliant," but he can only proceed by telling himself repeatedly that whatever comes out will be fine. How it's received isn't of ultimate importance. Writing, he says, is acknowledging the divine spark of life, then allowing it to run freely.

Texto completo: Paula McLain had published a book of poetry, a memoir and a novel when she got this crazy idea to venture into the realm of historical fiction.
Since she felt that nobody had paid much attention to her previous books, she didn’t think anyone would be bothered by her audacity at tackling the story of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson.
“Nobody had ever read my books before,” says McLain, who will visit Lancaster County later this month for the annual Author Luncheon, a fundraiser for local libraries. “When the idea hit I didn’t feel like there was a dramatic level of exposure. Oh, I’m writing about Ernest Hemingway, like how cheeky. I just assumed that I’d finish the book and no one would read it.”
McLain, who lives with her husband and two of her three children in Ohio, spent the next seven months writing the first draft of her book.
Much to her surprise, when it was published in 2011, “The Paris Wife” connected with readers and the book rose to the higher reaches of the New York Times best-seller list — where it stayed.
“It changed my life,” McLain says. “It changed everything about my writing life,” McLain says.
Abandoned at 4
McLain, 54, was born in Fresno, California. Her father was in and out of jail and her mother abandoned her and her two sisters when she was 4 years old.
She spent the rest of her childhood moving from one foster home to another until she was 18, when she was suddenly expected to make her way alone.
Her harrowing childhood is the subject of the memoir, “Like Family; Growing Up in Other People’s Houses,” which was published in 2003.
“I wanted to write a beautiful book,” she says. “I wanted to write something I could be proud of. I meant to write a literary book. It probably would have sold better if I had been more lurid.”
She started writing the memoir while attending graduate school at the University of Michigan, where she earned a master of fine arts in poetry.
She published a collection of poems in 1999 and her first novel, “Ticket to Ride,” in 2008.
The books did not sell well and money was tight. McLain, who had three children at home at that time, also had three different teaching jobs, none of which paid particularly well. She lugged her laptop to a Starbucks every day for seven months because she couldn’t concentrate at home, even when her husband or a baby sitter were watching the children.
“It was really hard to hold on to any creative ambitions or dreams, you know,” McLain says. “I had always written. I was always going to do it. Certainly, the success of ‘The Paris Wife’ made it easier for me to do that. I don’t have to sit and write at Starbucks. I don’t have to teach if I don’t want to.
“And people actually read my books.”
Following the success of “The Paris Wife,” McLain’s editor blithely pointed out that Hemingway had four wives, suggesting that she might consider writing books about each of his marriages.
“I laughed at her and said, ‘No way in hell,’ because I was never going to write about Hemingway again.”
She did, however, continue down the path of historical fiction as her next book, “Circling the Sun,” published in 2015, is about aviator Beryl Markham. She was the first pilot to make a solo, nonstop trip across the Atlantic Ocean, from east to west.
McLain was unsure of her next project, until she had a dream. She swears this is true.
“I hadn’t thought about (Hemingway) for years, and then I was fishing with him in a dream. And Martha Gellhorn was on the boat. And I woke up thinking, ‘What the hell was that?’ ”
What that was was her next book, “Love and Ruin,” published in 2018.
Hemingway’s wives
Much more than simply being Hemingway’s third wife, Martha Gellhorn, a journalist and novelist, is thought to be one of the best war correspondents of the 20th century.
She accompanied Hemingway to Spain during the Spanish Civil War and later covered World War II. Gellhorn, who attended but did not graduate from Bryn Mawr College outside of Philadelphia, was the only woman who landed at Normandy during the D-Day invasion.
“She’s just unbelievable, what she does,” McLain says. “Hemingway called her the bravest woman he’d ever known, and I believe it’s hard to argue with.”
Theirs was a tumultuous relationship, and they divorced in 1945 after five years of marriage. She was the only one of Hemingway’s wives who left him.
McLain tells the story in first person through Gellhorn’s voice, though there are some brief interludes in the book, where Hemingway becomes the narrator.
Beautifully written, “Love and Ruin” is both a wrenching tale of a troubled marriage and an illuminating look at two enormously gifted writers with a consuming desire for experience and adventure.
McLain’s gift is her ability to inhabit her characters so completely and write in a voice that sounds absolutely authentic. That her characters are real people who walked the Earth and have a recorded history makes her achievement all the more remarkable.
“It’s kind of my sweet spot as a writer, that channeling, I guess,” McLain says. “I’ve described it as finding an acting role and being plunged into that character and speaking through a consciousness, as if I’m in her skull and looking out her eyes and speaking with her voice.
“Of course, I’m not,” she sayd. “It’s a contrivance. It can’t be her, obviously. It’s someplace in the middle of where she becomes me and I become her simultaneously.”
McLain was noncommittal about whether her next book will also be historical fiction. Perhaps she’s waiting to see what her dreams tell her.

Silent partners in '20 presidential campaign deserve a better script

Texto completo: By Karen Tumulty

The Washington Post

Richard Nixon once offered Bill and Hillary Clinton some unsolicited advice on how married couples should conduct themselves if one of them happens to be running for president.

"If the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent," the former president told The New York Times in 1992, "it makes the husband look like a wimp."

But what if she is the one on the ballot?

There are no fewer than five couples testing that proposition as we ramp up to the 2020 election season. When it is the wife who is making her case to the voters, the answer thus far appears to be: The husband makes himself scarce.

John Bessler, Bruce Mann, Douglas Emhoff, Jonathan Gillibrand and Abraham Williams are in no immediate danger of becoming household names. (You might be drawing a blank. They are the spouses of Democratic presidential contenders -- respectively, Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.)

The husbands give few, if any, interviews. While you might spot them occasionally at campaign events, it is usually at a distance from the stage. As Gabbard gives her stump speech, Williams, a cinematographer, can be found in the crowd behind a camera, not in front. After Warren's rallies, more of her fans clamor to have their picture taken with her golden retriever Bailey than with Mann, Warren's legal-historian husband.

This, no doubt, will change, whether the men know it yet. As recently as 2004, Howard Dean's wife, Judith Steinberg Dean, a physician, tried to tend to her patients, rather than her husband's effort to win the Democratic nomination. When her absence became an issue, she was practically dragooned onto the former Vermont governor's campaign bus in Iowa.

The Clintons, of course, are not particularly instructive when it comes to figuring all of this out. They offered themselves as a package deal from the start. "Buy one. Get one free," he quipped, setting off a national argument that saw her branded as "the yuppie wife from hell" and "Lady Macbeth of

Arkansas." When she twice ran for president, it was far from clear whether her husband's looming presence and occasional outbursts helped or hurt.

That so many women are in the 2020 race is only one factor that may redefine the expectations Americans have of those who would share the residential floors of the White House with the next president.

The campaign's crop of partners also includes Chasten Glezman, the husband of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Glezman is a teacher who does comedy on the side and who gins up support for his spouse on his highly entertaining Twitter feed.

And if Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., remains single and is elected, he would be the first bachelor to enter the White House since President Grover Cleveland in 1885. (Cleveland married the following year.)

All of which suggests the time has finally arrived for a long-overdue reconsideration of the role of the presidential consort.

The traditional title of first lady comes with no job description beyond the presumption that she should take on an unobjectionable cause or two and enthusiastically offer her unpaid services as event planner, decorator and catering manager. As first gentleman, would venture capitalist Gillibrand or litigator Emhoff be picking out the china?

Standards are changing, even for couples playing more familiar roles.

It was considered unremarkable -- even expected -- for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush to be seen and not heard on the campaign stage, silent presences beaming at their husbands. But when former congressman Beto O'Rourke's wife, Amy Hoover Sanders, did that during his announcement video, the image generated a torrent of commentary and an article in The New York Times.

O'Rourke, meanwhile, felt compelled to apologize for joking in Iowa that his wife has been raising their two sons and daughter "sometimes with my help."

But Democratic pollster Celinda Lake notes that when women with young children run for office, they often deliberately put their husbands in their campaign ads to make precisely that point. "They're there to reassure voters that someone is there to take care of the kids," Lake told me.

Meanwhile, with so many women in the race, male candidates are likely to be relying on their wives more heavily than usual for validation with female voters.

The true running mates in 2020 will be a diverse cast. They are male and female, straight and gay. What we can hope is that, at the end of it all, they will have at last written a new script -- which is no script at all -- for the most difficult supporting role in politics.

It's time to spring clean your finances

Texto completo: Think of making a budget like spring-cleaning: It's a great way to get things in order around your house, and you'll feel so much better after it's done.
I know lots of people think of a budget as something that limits freedom. (I know because I was one of them.) But just like getting all those old clothes out of a closet and into a yard sale or finally Marie Kondo-ing your kitchen cupboards, there's a sense of relief once it's done. Both spring cleaning and budgeting give you freedom and space to do more of what you want to do.
Here are three things to remember that will make budgeting and spring cleaning much easier:
1. Tackle one area at a time
Don't think you have to clean the entire house in one fell swoop. Pick a small room to start and go after it. Once you have a little task done, go on to something larger. Same goes for your budget. Don't focus on saving 15 percent of your income or tens of thousands for your kids' college fund — that gets overwhelming fast. Start with Baby Step 1: Get $1,000 saved for emergencies. Then, tackle each Baby Step as you get there. For more on the Baby Steps, go to rachelcruze.com.
2. Start with a small task
If you begin cleaning and organizing in your bedroom, do something small and simple like cleaning out a drawer to get yourself into a work groove and see some progress. Just like budgeting for your debt snowball where you target one debt at a time (starting with the smallest), this approach will get you motivated to clean the rest of the rooms in your house.
Here's the next small thing to check off your list. It couldn't be easier to make sure your family, your savings, and your identity are covered with the right insurance policies. Take this 5-Minute Coverage Checkup to see what you need and what you don't: daveramsey.com/coverage-checkup.
3. Give yourself plenty of time
You don't need to have a schedule that would make the hosts of Hoarders beg for a rest. Set a timetable for yourself for each task. It's your house, so that means you get to operate on your clock. There's no need to compare your progress to anyone else's — and no need to think you're not winning because you're not at their level. Same goes for your progress as you budget, save money, and pay down debt.
You may feel like your house and money situation are both in a mess — and who hasn't at one time or another? That's totally normal. But the good news is, both situations can change starting right now.
As a #1 New York Times best-selling author, host of The Rachel Cruze Show and The Rachel Cruze Show Podcast, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt.
She's authored three best-selling books, including Love Your Life, Not Theirs and Smart Money Smart Kids, which she co-wrote with her father, Dave Ramsey. You can follow Cruze on Twitter and Instagram at @RachelCruze and online at rachelcruze.com.

In Australia, Muslims Call for Pressure on China Over Camps

Texto completo: ADELAIDE, Australia -- Growing up as a member of the Uighur ethnic group in China's far west, Farhad Habibullah never felt that his people were oppressed by the state. He came from a family of Communist Party loyalists, part of an elite segment of Uighur society celebrated by the party as model minority members.
But now he has joined other Uighurs in doing what was once, to him, unthinkable -- and unthinkably dangerous, even in his new home in Australia: calling for an independent Uighur nation.
"My parents worked for the Chinese Communist Party all their lives, and look at what has happened to them," Mr. Habibullah said. They and several other relatives, he said, are among as many as one million Uighurs and other Muslims held in indoctrination camps in China.
"You could say I grew up under the red Chinese flag," he said. "But now I think we have to fight for independence."
About 3,000 Uighurs have found sanctuary in Australia. But as some of them draw attention to China's camps, they are putting their adopted homeland in an awkward position, pressing it to speak out against its largest trading partner.
More than a dozen Uighurs who are Australian permanent residents are missing in China and presumed to be in detention, activists say. Former detainees say China's camps are meant to root out devotion to Islam and replace it with loyalty to the state. Uighurs have lobbied Parliament to act, circulating petitions and holding regular protests, chanting: "China, out! Out, out, out!"
Some Uighurs say that while they feel welcome here, they also fear that Islamophobia is on the rise. They say some people at rallies have said their people were terrorists who deserved to be in camps.
Some Uighurs also say they have been harassed by the Chinese authorities even while living in Australia. And they feel powerless over the fate of relatives back home, some of whom they have not heard from in years.
Mr. Habibullah finds support at gatherings like the one held in an Adelaide dinner hall on a recent Monday, attended by about 300 Uighurs, many in traditional dress. The flag of their hoped-for republic, East Turkestan, was on display, and the aroma of Uighur dishes like lamb pilaf and walnut cake filled the room.
As she held her 6-month-old baby, Zulihumaer Aibibula, 32, showed several pictures of relatives who were missing in China's far western region of Xinjiang, including her 35-year-old brother. For families abroad, who are not notified when a member disappears into one of China's secretive camps, prolonged silence is usually the only sign that it has happened.
Ms. Aibibula said the Chinese authorities had been pushing her family to ask her for her Australian passport number, address and other personal details. She refused to hand the information over, and shortly after, her brother disappeared.
"The Chinese government is putting so much pressure on Uighurs," she said, wiping her eyes. "They are forcing people to go up against them."
Xinjiang has long been troubled by tension between Uighurs, who are Sunni Muslims, and the government. Some Uighurs have carried out acts of violence against the government, which has imposed heavy restrictions in the region. The Chinese government depicts its detention camps as schools that steer Uighurs and other Muslims away from violent extremism by providing skills training.
Uighur activists say the government unfairly depicts Uighurs trying to escape its persecution as extremists.
In Australia, many Uighurs live in the Adelaide suburb of Gilles Plains, where one in 10 residents is Muslim. At the heart of the community is a mosque and a center where a Uighur group runs a language school and a soccer club.

Their political cause is never far from their minds, says Anna Hayes, an expert on Xinjiang at James Cook University in Cairns, who spent time studying Uighurs here in 2011. That year, the community held a cultural exhibition that featured images of Uighur rallies and the blue flag of East Turkestan, as they call their homeland. Such displays would be banned in China.
In the past two years, many local Uighurs have been traumatized by the mass detentions back home and told her they were depressed, Dr. Hayes said. "I thought maybe it would be described like survivor's guilt."
The Uighurs want the Australian government to step up its criticism of China's camps. Australia was relatively muted about the issue until November, when it joined other Western nations in urging China to release the detainees.
But Canberra's ties with Beijing are in a delicate state, as it tries to balance Australia's economic needs with national security concerns over expanding Chinese influence in the country.
Officials worked to retrieve three citizens of Uighur descent who were detained in Xinjiang in 2017, who have since returned. But Nurgul Sawut, an activist based in Canberra who helped compile the list of Australian permanent residents missing in China, said recent requests for help have been passed from one agency to another.
"We have been let down," said Ms. Sawut. "We're just falling through the cracks as they escape their responsibilities, but the families cannot afford to wait."
Australia's slow response to the issue is due in part to its dependence on trade with China, said James Leibold, a scholar of China's ethnic policies at La Trobe University in Melbourne. "We're incredibly vulnerable to China over the economic front," he said.
Australia's foreign affairs department said in a statement that the country "continues to urge China to cease the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and other Muslim groups."
The apparent detention of Mr. Habibullah's parents underscores the expansive nature of the security crackdown in Xinjiang.
His mother was a city police superintendent, while his father had served in the People's Liberation Army and later held a senior post at a state-run broadcaster. Mr. Habibullah himself attended an elite high school in Beijing, which paved the way for him to leave China for a comfortable life abroad.
His parents were the last people who would ever criticize the Chinese government, he said.
Despite living abroad, Mr. Habibullah chatted with his parents regularly on the Chinese messaging service WeChat. Suddenly, in August, they stopped answering his messages.
He contacted police stations in Xinjiang and his parents' old workplaces, and he tried an official in the state security agency, all to no avail. With nine others in his family already missing, he feared the worst.
"I have lost everything," he said repeatedly during an interview in February.
Late last month, however -- days after The New York Times submitted requests to the Chinese authorities for comment on Mr. Habibullah's family -- he was told by a relative in Switzerland that his parents and sister-in-law had just been freed. The Xinjiang government said in a fax to The Times later that the three were living "normal lives" in Karamay, the city where they have resided.
For the first time in many months, Mr. Habibullah spoke to his parents by phone, he said, in a call he described as strange for how normal they sought to sound. Much was left unsaid -- and unexplained.
"I really wanted to ask my mother where all our other relatives are," Mr. Habibullah said, "but I couldn't because our call was definitely being monitored."
Ms. Sawut, the Uighur activist, said the news gave her hope.
"End of the day, we'd like to see or hear that our relatives or parents are safe," she said. "Are they safe?"

Texto completo: The United Nations-backed government of Libya sought on Saturday to reassure its Western supporters by distancing itself from terrorists and extremists.
Some fighters with extremist ties or who have been targeted by United Nations sanctions have said this week that they were joining the Libyan government's fight against an attack by a militia leader.
The militia leader, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, 75, has long portrayed himself as commanding a fight against terrorism as he has tried to establish himself as a new military ruler of Libya. He has promised an end to the mayhem of warring factions and fiefdoms that has followed the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi during the Arab Spring uprising of 2011.
But his critics say his often indiscriminate attacks have only ended up driving more mainstream opponents into alliances of desperation with militants and extremists.
That debate has now taken on new urgency because over the last nine days, General Hifter, who loosely controls much of eastern Libya, has begun a new attempt to take over the headquarters of the United Nations-backed government in the capital, Tripoli.
The government said Saturday it "strongly denies the allegations that among our ranks there are fighters who belong to terrorist organizations."
Its main defenders have been powerful militias based in the nearby cities of Zintan and Misrata that led the fight to oust Colonel Qaddafi and are not considered extremists. Militias from Misrata had previously played the leading role in defeating the militants of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, after they had established a Libyan base.
But several fighters with extremist ties or under United Nations sanctions have also said they are joining the battle against General Hifter.
Among them is the warlord Salah Badi, who has previously allied with Islamist extremists and who is under United Nations sanctions for undermining stability. Also joining the fray is Brigade Defend Benghazi, which largely absorbed an earlier coalition that included a militia under United Nations sanctions as a terrorist organization.
The militia it included was Ansar al-Shariah, whose fighters played a major role in the attack on a United States diplomatic compound that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in 2012.
Ziad Bellam, a brigade leader who also fought against General Hifter in Benghazi, said in an online video last week that he was returning to the battle in Tripoli to avenge a deceased leader of Ansar al-Shariah and other comrades considered extremists.
Western governments have almost universally condemned General Hifter's advance on the capital, which upended United Nations efforts to negotiate a solution to the Libyan fighting.
But the European Union said Thursday that its members "express their concern at the involvement of terrorist and criminal elements in the fighting, including individuals listed by the U.N. Security Council."
The New York Times also reported on Friday about extremists and others under United Nations sanctions rushing into the fight against General Hifter.
In an apparent response to that report and the European Union, the government in Tripoli said Saturday that it "was and still is fighting terrorism and hunting down its remnants."
The government argued on Saturday that it was General Hifter's attack that had "opened the road to the reactivation of the terrorist sleeper cells that are waiting for the opportunity."

Why Does Trump Want to Debase the Fed?

Texto completo: AS FAR AS I know, the Federal Reserve — the world's most important economic policy institution — doesn't have an anthem. But if it were to adopt one now, the choice would be obvious: “Send In the Clowns."
You see, the Fed's governing board currently has two vacancies, and Donald Trump has proposed filling those vacancies with ludicrous hacks. If he succeeds, one of our few remaining havens of serious, nonpartisan policymaking will be on its way toward becoming as corrupt and dysfunctional as the rest of the Trump administration.
Stephen Moore and Herman Cain are, of course, completely unqualified — I say “of course" because their lack of qualifications is, paradoxically, a key qualification not just for Trump but for the GOP in general.
There are plenty of genuine monetary experts with conservative political leanings, some of them quite partisan. But modern Republicans have shown consistent disdain for such experts, perhaps because of a sense that anyone with real expertise or an independent reputation might occasionally be tempted to take a stand on principle.
There's no risk that either Moore or Cain will ever take such a stand. In fact, what seems to have recommended both men to Trump was their evident willingness to completely reverse their policy views when politically expedient.
Both were hard-money men during the Obama years, demanding higher interest rates despite very high unemployment. Both have now taken to berating the Fed for failing to print more money in the face of low unemployment — because that's what Trump wants.
That said, there's a difference between the two men.
I wrote about Moore a couple of weeks ago, noting that he has long been a prominent fixture in the conservative movement; he is, basically, a classic right-wing hack who tries (incompetently) to impersonate an economic expert. Cain, on the other hand, is a spam king whose business model involves making his email list available to direct marketers.
Put it this way: In recent years Moore has been out there predicting magical results from tax cuts, putting out fake economic numbers and giving speeches to FreedomFest. At the same time, Cain has been offering a platform for peddlers of get-rich schemes and cures for erectile dysfunction. So it says something about what Trump wants that he apparently sees the two men as equally valuable allies.
What does Trump want? His attempted beclowning of the Fed follows, I'd argue, from the fact that his one major legislative success, the 2017 tax cut — which he predicted would be “rocket fuel" for the economy — has turned out to be a big fizzle, economically and, especially, politically.
It's true that U.S. economic growth got a bump for two quarters last year, and Trumpists are still pretending to believe that we'll have great growth for a decade. But at this point last year's growth is looking like a brief and rapidly fading sugar high.
Meanwhile, the tax cut remains unpopular, partly because few people perceived personal benefits, partly because voters appear to be less concerned about paying too much than with the sense that the rich — the prime beneficiaries of the Trump cut — are paying too little.
Some leaders might see such disappointments as reasons to make a course correction. But this is Trump: When the going gets tough, he blames someone else. Everything would have been great, he insists, if the Fed hadn't thwarted his plans.
There's a good argument to be made that the Fed misjudged the economy's strength, that it raised interest rates too fast and that the economy would be doing somewhat better if it hadn't. In fact, it's an argument I agree with.
But that's not what Trump is saying. He wants the Fed to act as if we were still in a deep depression; he wants it both to cut rates and to resume the emergency policies it pursued — and he denounced — when we had more than twice as much unemployment as we do today. This would, he insists, turn the economy into the “rocket ship" he originally promised.
You don't have to be a gold bug or even an inflation hawk to see these demands as deeply irresponsible. Indeed, they sound a lot like the “macroeconomic populism" that has repeatedly led to economic disaster in Latin America, with Venezuela the latest example.
Running the printing presses to fight a depression, as the Fed did after the financial crisis, is prudent and sensible; running them because you refuse to accept the reality that your policies aren't delivering an economic miracle is different, and always ends badly.
Now, even putting both Moore and Cain on the Fed board probably wouldn't be enough to push America over the monetary edge. And so far, markets don't seem worried about the potential for runaway inflation.
But maybe investors should be worried, at least a bit, by the spectacle of a president who would rather appoint hacks and debase the Fed's integrity than admit that his policies aren't working as promised. U.S. policymaking is looking ever more like that of a corrupt third-world regime. And that is bound, sooner or later, to have consequences.

Your lawyer is unreal: How to spot the scammers

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Texto completo: La hermana mayor del presidente Donald Trump, Maryanne Trump Barry, se retiró como jueza federal de apelaciones, poniendo fin a una investigación sobre si ella violó las reglas de conducta judicial al participar en planes de impuestos fraudulentos con sus hermanos.
Una investigación realizada por The New York Times descubrió el pasado octubre que los Trump se habían comprometido en dudosos planes fiscales durante la década de 1990, incluyendo casos de fraude, que aumentaron considerablemente la riqueza heredada por Trump y su hermanos.
La juez Barry no solo se habría beneficiado financieramente de la mayoría de esos esquemas de impuestos, según este diario, sino que ella también estaba en posición de influir en las acciones que tomaba su familia.
Según el periódico, Barry presentó sus documentos de retiro diez días después de que los funcionarios judiciales notificaron a los reclamantes que el asunto estaba “recibiendo toda la atención” de un consejo de conducta judicial. Como juez inactiva, Barry ya no enfrentará ahora la acusación de mala conducta judicial, ya que el estatuto solo se aplica a los jueces activos, según el Times.
La información aún no se ha anunciado públicamente, pero los reclamantes, al menos dos de ellos vinculados a la profesión legal, se dieron cuenta la semana pasada de que el caso se había retirado sin conclusiones sobre las denuncias.
Si bien antes se arriesgó a ser reprendida, castigada o incluso acusada por la investigación de la revisión del consejo judicial, ahora tiene derecho a un salario de jubilación que podría oscilar entre los 184.500 y 217.600 dólares anuales. Barry no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios del Times.
El presidente Ronald Reagan seleccionó a Barry, una exfiscal, para servir en el Tribunal del Distrito Federal en Nueva Jersey en 1983. El presidente Bill Clinton la nominó para el Tribunal de Apelaciones del Tercer Circuito de los Estados Unidos en 1999.

Texto completo: La emergencia de salud pública que enfrenta la ciudad de Nueva York por el brote de sarampión está centrada en los planteles educativos de la comunidad judía ortodoxa conocidos como Yeshivas . Pero datos del Departamento de Educación (DOE) demuestran que al menos 2,700 niños las escuelas públicas regulares , tampoco se han vacunado contra la enfermedad.
Cifras del Departamento de Salud de la Ciudad (DHMH) indican que de las 285 personas enfermas de sarampión hasta ahora, al menos 256 son niños de las Yeshivas. Y aunque no se ha registrado una crisis similar en el sistema escolar en general de la Gran Manzana, las cifras de la falta de vacunación están causando preocupación.
Pero las autoridades de la Ciudad aseguran que esos 2,700 estudiantes apenas representan el 0.3% de la población estudiantil, que en total es de 1.1 millones de estudiantes , más del 41% de ellos de origen hispano .
Las cifras sobre alumnos no vacunados las reportó el Daily News, y estarían relacionadas a exenciones por razones médicas o religiosas. Sin embargo, el total de niños que no han sido inmunizados podría ser de hasta más de 20,000 en todos los cinco condados , según el DOE, por diferentes razones que no tienen que ver con el rechazo a las vacunas.
Actualmente, para que un niño pueda ser admitido en las escuelas se les exige a los padres que les pongan 10 diferentes vacunas, un proceso que se realiza entre el pre-kinder hasta el décimo segundo grado, incluyendo el sarampión, la polio, hepatitis y la influenza.
“Los estudiantes que asisten a las escuelas del Departamento de Educación deben ser vacunados, y con el 98% de los estudiantes totalmente vacunados, nuestras escuelas públicas están seguras”, dijo Doug Cohen , portavoz del DOE.
El rechazo en la comunidad judía a las vacunas ha estado provocado, en parte, por las creencias religiosas, pero también a una fuerte campaña anti-vacunación de grupos que se basan en falsos reportes científicos.
En Williamsburg , el vecindario de Brooklyn con la mayor comunidad judía ortodoxa de la ciudad de Nueva York, circula una publicación que promueve a los padres a no vacunar a sus hijos, alertando de que las vacunas portan “ADN de mono, rata y cerdo” .
El ‘Manual de Seguridad de la Vacuna’ también publican falsas advertencias de que las vacunas causan autismo y contienen células de fetos humanos abortados, según reportó The New York Times.
“Creemos que no hay mayor amenaza para la salud pública que las vacunas”, indicó la publicación en uno de sus artículos en el manual, contradiciendo el consenso científico de que las vacunas son generalmente seguras y altamente efectivas.
Y precisamente para evitar ser obligados a vacunar a sus hijos, varias familias judías planean damandar a la Ciudad, en rechazo a la orden emitida el pasado lunes como parte de la emergencia de salud, que obliga a los padres a vacunar a los pequeños o se enfrentan multas de hasta $1,000 dólares , y alerta a las escuelas que reciban a los niños no vacunados a enfrentar el posible cierre.
Las autoridades de Salud de la Ciudad exigieron que todos los niños de seis meses o más en los códigos postales 11205, 11206, 11211 y 11249 , que son vecindario de judíos ortodoxos en Brooklyn , deben recibir la vacuna.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING – Bailey Kowalski wants to fight for the silent sexual assault survivors.
She knows what it's like to be one of them.
Known only as "Jane Doe" since filing a lawsuit against Michigan State University last April, Kowalski held an East Lansing news conference Thursday to put her voice and face behind her claim that university counselors coerced her to not report her sexual assault to police or campus officials. She was young and terrified then and believed the counselors who told her it would be best to keep silent.
She chose Thursday for her news conference — exactly four years from when she says three former MSU basketball players sexually assaulted her. Kowalski spoke to the New York Times for an article that published Wednesday as well.
"The silent survivors matter and they're worth fighting for," Kowalski said. "I want the system surrounding Michigan State University to change."
The 22-year-old MSU senior was visibly nervous before stepping to the podium in front of dozens of journalists from local and national outlets, but her confidence grew as she spoke, just as it has in the four years since the assault.
"I became a shell of who I once was," Kowalski said of the time immediately after the attack. "I became anxious, depressed and closed off."
Although she's not fully healed now, and not the same person she was before, Kowalski said that might not be a bad thing.
"I look forward to who I will become because I took this step," Kowalski said.
The rape followed a night at a bar Kowalski's lawsuit says she was an 18-year-old freshman at MSU when she was sexually assaulted by three basketball players at one of their apartments. She'd met the players at Harper's bar, where she'd used a fake ID to enter. The team was fresh off its loss to Duke in the 2015 NCAA Final Four.
She said one of the men invited her to a party, but, when they arrived, only a few others were there. Her lawsuit says she felt "discombobulated" and could not control her thumbs to send a text.
One of the men pulled her into a bedroom, according to the lawsuit, saying "You're mine for the night."
His words made her uncomfortable, and she made her way back to the living room. She couldn't move her hands properly, according to the lawsuit, and thought she might have been drugged.
A second man offered to show her his basketball memorabilia and took her to his bedroom. The room went dark.
She was thrown face down on the bed, held in place while he sexually assaulted her, according to the lawsuit. She couldn't move or speak. Two other men took turns sexually assaulting her as well.
About a week later, she went to the university counseling center to talk to someone about the assault. After she told them basketball players were involved, the staff discouraged her from reporting it to police or the university, according to the lawsuit.
A counselor told her it would be an "uphill battle" and that she would be "swimming with some really big fish" if she chose to pursue the case.
"I took it as a threat, but I trusted the university at the time, so I thought she was probably telling me the truth," Kowalski said Thursday.
Why she came forward now Kowalski will graduate from MSU this year with a major in integrated biology. She said Thursday that she didn't want to walk across that stage without saying something about the assault.
She said she's been living a double life since 2015; she had to make up a story about why she switched her major from sports journalism to biology, why she went from a bleed-green Spartan fan to not caring about this year's Final Four game.
"If I didn't (speak out), I would be neglecting other victims and leaving them behind," Kowalski said. "Knowing I can be there for somebody right now, knowing there are women and men who exist as survivors, I look forward to being their support system if they do not have one.
"They do not have to be silenced, this isn't a burden they have to carry on their own."
Kowalski has not reported the assault to the police and is not sure if she will do so in the future. When asked why, she and her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, declined to answer.
Truszkowski said they did not have any settlement agreement with the individual players, who now play professionally. Neither Truszkowski or Kowalski would release the players' names.
Moving on requires action Even once Kowalski graduates, the problems will still exist at MSU, she said, and the only way to fix things is with accountability.
"I want the system surrounding Michigan State to change," Kowalski said. "I want all people to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their status."
Truszkowski has litigated several cases involving sexual assaults at MSU.
"There's obviously a problem here that needs to be addressed," Truszkowski said. "We need to start putting some pressure on the people who need the pressure."
Kowalski made a point of saying she does not have a vendetta against the basketball team.
"For me, this is not a basketball story. I did not choose who my rapists were," she said. "This is not about bringing attention to basketball team. I want to be a voice for individuals."

Bret Easton Ellis turns to nonfiction to talk Trump, Kanye West, ‘American Psycho’ and our whiny culture in ‘White’

Texto completo: By the fall of 1990, Bret Easton Ellis had enjoyed the success of his debut novel “Less Than Zero,” seen it adapted by Hollywood, and published a second novel all before he’d turned 27.
And then “American Psycho” happened.
Or more accurately, at first it didn’t happen: Just weeks before publication, Simon & Schuster canceled the book amid outcry over the violence in the black satire about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer.
And then it was back on. Knopf plucked “American Psycho” off its rival publisher’s scrapheap and published it 1991 to widespread publicity that zigzagged between acclaim and scorn.
While Ellis found success with the book, and the movie adaptation that followed years later, in that moment of controversy something changed. These events would influence his perspective on the world, on the role of the independently minded individual and on the ability to be truly free. All this flows across the pages of “White,” his first-ever book of non-fiction, and first book at all in nine years.
“That for me was a wake-up call,” Ellis says recently from his home in West Hollywood just over the hills from the San Fernando Valley of his childhood and adolescence. “That a corporation was making decisions about what creatively a subsidiary could do creatively. What a publishing house was allowed to publish and was not allowed to publish.”
It was, Ellis says, his close-up look at a mob mentality, a hysteria over fiction that nearly no one, including all of the individuals and organizations arguing against “American Psycho,” had read.
“Like the cancellation was going to save something in America,” he says. “It was a moment. My friends were right. Jay McInerney (author of “Bright Lights, Big City,” which made a similar splash to that of “Less Than Zero”) said recently in the New York Times that he believes that’s where my freedom of expression and hating censorship and self-censorship really began.”
In “White,” which is crafted as a series of loosely themed essays, many of them adaptations of pieces originally written as monologues for “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Ellis shows readers where that mindset – fiercely independent, sometimes controversial, and always outspoken – has led him today.
“It came together very quickly in terms of the mood I was in at this moment,” he says. “And the changes I was feeling as a member of a generation who really, you know, was mostly noted for not really be able to take offense at anything, and finding myself forced into a way of thinking that I never that I would before.
“I never thought I would have been labeled or considered, as my democratic socialist boyfriend calls me, very much in the center, rather than what I always thought was a progressive gay guy.”
So what offends the 55-year-old Gen X-er today? He points to groupthink and virtue-signaling, trigger warnings and safe spaces, the culture of victimhood, and perhaps most of all, what Ellis views as the tension between the righteousness of rationality and logic and the wrongheadedness of emotion-fueled sensitivity, though he admits that inside his own home that distinction depends on one’s particular point of view.
“He thinks I’m nuts,” Ellis says of his 32-year-old millennial boyfriend of more than a decade now. “I’m over-emotional, I’m a drama queen, I don’t see anything rationally or with logic whatsoever.
“That is where we are,” he says, and laughs.
The book runs in a relaxed chronology, from an adolescence in the Valley focused on horror movies, the beauty of Richard Gere in “American Gigolo,” and the furtive pursuit of porn in the pre-digital age, to the publication of “Less Than Zero,” the unsatisfying adaptation into a movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy, the “American Psycho” controversy, and eventually, his dismay at the dismay of Democrats and the mainstream media at the rise of Trumpism in the United States.
Not because he agrees with Trump on much of anything, but because of his distaste for what he considers the dishonest arguments and overkill with which Trump foes attack him.
“I do think if this had been written, I don’t know, 10 years ago, I would have totally gone after the Tea Party and the birther movement or whatever,” Ellis says. “It’s always an extreme or something that is hysterical or so rooted in kind of fundamentalism that bothers me. I sensed that a lot in the last four years, and it’s just kind of gotten out of control.”
“White” will surely anger some readers, but if they’ve followed Ellis’ writing in fiction, journalism, or social media they shouldn’t be that surprised. His Twitter feed, in particular, was home to some of his darkest humor, eventually sparking so much outrage that he largely abandoned the platform but includes a chapter titled “Tweeting” in the book.”
“I loved Twitter,” he says. “A lot of it was funny, it was exciting. It was to titillate and outrage people, which is what creative people do. That is their instinct, to push boundaries. And then it started morphing.
“I guess it’s about power-grabbing, one group trying to shut down another group. Now it’s all negative, and it is not fun anymore.”
“White” closes with a section on Kanye West, a creative artist who like Ellis has had his share of public controversy. West approached Ellis to write a script for him, and they’ve worked on other projects in recent years, and Ellis says he quickly came to admire West for his iconoclasm and refusal to change to appease his critics.
“He has this notion of freedom that is extremely appealing to a lot of people,” he says. “Regardless of whether you agree with it all or not, he is really his own man. He’s contradictory, he makes mistakes, he falls down, he picks himself up.
“It’s not that I agree with Kanye 100 percent, I don’t,” Ellis says. “But I like the notion of Kanye, and I like that kind of person who is unencumbered by feeling he has to tell a narrative that he doesn’t believe in just to placate the press.”
Like West, Ellis has no interest in pacifying his public critics, though he says at home he and his boyfriend have reached a truce of sorts as the 2020 presidential campaigns begin, and his partner – “a committed Bernie bro” – rededicates himself to MSNBC’s coverage.
“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Texto completo: Every generation has a fresh take on parenting, its own personal stamp on how children should be raised. Lately, though, it seems we hear of a new style every few weeks. First there were attachment parents and helicopter parents, and now come the snowplow parents.
This last group is particularly infuriating because it means just what one might expect: to remove all obstacles in the path of a child. In other words, instead of preparing the child for the road ahead, the parent prepares the road itself. They plow it and pave it and block traffic. Sometimes, as in the case of the parents in the college admissions scandal, they even commit fraud.
As far as parenting styles named for heavy machinery are concerned, it seems that snowplows deserve more ire than helicopter parents — characterized as those who hover too close — because snowplows do more than hover. They do the work, sometimes even the dirty work, for the child.
Of course there's a big difference between over-parenting and engaging in criminal activity. Either way, I'm curious if there's anything positive to glean from the revelation of how far some parents go to shelter their children from the travails of growing up. How did we get here, by the way? And what can parents of more modest means (and probably stronger ethics) do instead to better prepare their children to succeed in the world?
First, let's remember: Failure is good. Not all the time, not as a way of being or way of life. But failure teaches kids resilience, creativity, and prioritization. Through failure, we learn what matters enough that we are willing to work relentlessly toward it no matter how many times we fail; or we learn to adapt and recognize new opportunities when something doesn't work out.
Jessica Lahey, New York Times best-selling author of the book, “The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed" and a longtime educator, puts it this way: “Kids need to have a positive, adaptive response to failures in order to learn from them, so every time we swoop in and save kids from a consequence, that's a learning opportunity lost."
When it comes to parenting, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Each kid is different. The strengths and resources of parents vary greatly. And yet, one technique stands out for me, which can be summed up in two words: Be present.
Practically speaking, babies and toddlers do not exist anywhere other than the present moment. When they are hungry, hunger is all that exists. When they are in pain, pain is all-encompassing. Older children understand the concept of time, but their needs are only slightly less immediate. You can reason that you'll go to the playground not today but tomorrow or request that no one wake you before 7 a.m. on Saturdays, but a child of any age still often needs a response in the moment.
When it comes to parenting, the most important question might not be which style we choose, but how we show up for our children in a given moment. One moment after the other. Every day. Year layered upon year, like tiers of birthday cake or bricks. Granted, no one is perfect, never distracted, or immune to a bad mood or short fuse, but before we can be “good" parents, we must first be present ones. We can borrow wisdom from all kinds of parenting styles: from Montessori or Tiger Mamas, attachment or anything goes, but it all seems secondary to the question of whether our faces light up when they enter a room. Do we take the time to be attentive in their presence?
We teach kids to stop and look both ways before crossing the street. It's a crucial safety precaution, but it can also serve as mindfulness inspiration as parents. How often do we take pause, stopping to consider what is happening as it's happening, rather than merely reacting? As parents, do we have a stop-and-look equivalent as the moment is unfolding?
To be present involves seeing a child for who he or she is, rather than, say, a variation of his/her face Photoshopped onto the body of an Ivy League soccer player. Ludicrous as it sounds, parents in the college admissions scandal used this technique. It's extreme and fraudulent and laughable to the rest of us, but it also stems from a place to which even the most well-meaning among us can probably relate. Haven't we each felt at some point that our own parents wished we might be a little different: more like a sibling, studying to be a doctor, or at least married by now?
Before becoming a mother, I confess to thinking that parenting might be a code that could be cracked if I read enough books. So, before my daughter was born, I started with sleep. I read all the sleep books. I polled friends whose children slept through the night early and easily. I would do what they did. I would read what they read. I highlighted these books, dog-eared important pages, read paragraphs aloud to my husband.
When the time came for our baby to sleep through the night, our pediatrician was adamant: We were not candidates for that approach yet. Our daughter was underweight, not dangerously so but worrisome enough, and the instructions were clear. If she awoke, she was to be fed. Not shushed, soothed, or left to cry as various sleep training methods suggest.
I never cracked those books again. I nursed our baby in the middle of the night, whenever she needed, until one night, she slept through. She made this determination of readiness on her own, and we followed her lead. This revelation was one of the first and most formative parenting lessons I experienced as a new mom. I had such a predetermined vision for how things would go, only to discover that it would be detrimental (if not dangerous) to proceed with it. The decision to recalibrate was easy and obvious, but I have thought about it a lot since because it was such a powerful example of how children have agency from the beginning. They are small people with their own needs and timing, and our role is not to enforce a future agenda but be as open and loving as we can with the realities we face together in the moment.
It should be noted that reality can often be a drag. Last week, my daughter vomited directly in my ear. If there's a parenting lesson there, it's probably that another human being can vomit directly in your ear and if that human being is your child, all you will think is, “Oh, god, I love you so much; I just want you to feel better."
Even when the moment is disgusting or disappointing, heartbreaking or tedious, our kids will notice and respond most to who we are being in the moment more than what we say or will them to accomplish. But amid the everyday parenting pressures, along with social media's drive to parent performatively, it's easy to forget. Our vision gets obscured by the cello lessons, test scores, and acceptance letters. This one speaks three languages. That one does Russian Math. It can feel like our report card, maybe more than theirs.
Stop. Breathe. Be here, in this moment, with yourself, with your kid whom you love. That's the job. Leave the plowing of snow and hovering at 460 rotations per minute to the heavy machinery.

Texto completo: Chuck and Mira Costa named their band after a piece of ancient Greek history they stumbled across.
"When these soldiers are coming back from war, back home to the ocean where they live, and they see home and they knew they'll survive, they cry, 'the sea, the sea!'" Chuck said.
The Sea, The Sea is one of the bands appearing at the 5th annual Word of South Friday through Sunday at Cascades Park.
The indie folk-pop wife and husband duo will be traveling to Word of South with two new band members — a percussionist and keyboardist — as one of the stops on their tour. The band has never been to Tallahassee.
"We're always re-imagining and sculpting the sets we want to play. Definitely, outdoor shows and festival shows, you're always, sort of, in a conversation with your environment," Mira said.
That conversation will include the song "Love We Are We Love," which has reached nearly 11 million people worldwide, Mira said.
"That song has, sort of, been a beautiful connector for us with people all over the country and all over the world," she said. "We tend to play that wherever we go because a lot of people, if they're familiar with us, are familiar with that song."
Chuck added: "I think that because (all our songs) come from an honest place when we write them, they always seem to resonate and ring true every time we play them."
Word of South is also hosting the induction ceremony for the Florida Artists Hall of Fame this year. Recording artist Bertie Higgins, painter George Inness, Jr. and sculptor Ann Norton will join the ranks of such names as Ray Charles, Burt Reynolds and Zora Neale Hurston.
Local and regional journalists will join together for a Journalism in the South panel to discuss and answer questions about the challenges and changes to the industry over time. The panel will be moderated by Leon County Commissioner and former Tallahassee Democrat editorial page editor Mary Ann Lindley.
Fans of the thriller genre can look forward to No. 1 New York Times Bestselling author of "Horns" — and son of Stephen King — Joe Hill, who will appear on stage with rock and roll musician Matthew Ryan.

Texto completo: The annual DETROIT GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY PARADE will be rousing downtown Detroit from its usual Sunday-afternoon slumber this weekend. Now in its 18th year, the parade is a celebration of Greece and Greek-American culture in Michigan, Ohio and Ontario and includes Greek dancers and musicians in traditional attire, floats designed by metro Detroit schools and businesses, and some of those giant papier-mache heads that turn up every year for Detroit's Thanksgiving parade. Some of your favorite Lions, Tigers and Pistons will be joining in the fun along with Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II. The procession starts at 3 p.m. at Campus Martius Park and proceeds along Monroe Street to the Greektown Casino Hotel. It will be followed at 4 p.m. by a post-parade ceremony, dance performances and a street festival in the Greektown neighborhood.
3 p.m. Sunday, downtown Detroit. detroit.greekparades.com.
The revered JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET, which is marking its 73rd birthday in 2019, is in town this weekend for two performances with the young Argus Quartet, which was founded just six years ago. Friday's performance at the Schaver Music Recital Hall on Wayne State's campus will include classical-era works by Haydn and Boccherini along with Bartok's String Quartet No. 3 and "Eight Colors for String Quartet" by Chinese-American composer Tan Dun. Former Free Press music critic Mark Stryker will lead a post-concert discussion. Saturday's program in Beverly Hills includes Dvorak's Quartet in F major (the "American Quartet") and works by Beethoven and American composer Lembit Beecher. The Argus will perform Debussy's String Quartet in G minor during a 7 p.m. pre-concert recital. The concerts are being presented by the Chamber Music Society of Detroit.
8 p.m. Friday, Schaver Music Recital Hall, Wayne State University. $30, $25 seniors, $10 students. 8 p.m. Saturday, Seligman Performing Arts Center, Beverly Hills. $20-$65 adults, $10-$32.50 students. 313-335-3300. cmsdetroit.org.
"He vas my boyfriend!" Cloris Leachman famously shrieked the line back in 1974 when she co-starred in the Mel Brooks movie hit "YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN," and Brooks revived it and set it to music when he adapted the movie for the Broadway stage 12 years ago. His musical, which ran for a little more than a year and got mixed reviews, has been dusted off this spring for a local staging by the Detroit Mercy Theatre Company, which will deliver its final three performances this weekend. The University of Detroit Mercy's Greg Grobis directs a cast that features professional guest artists, including Conor Sullivan (as Frederick Frankenstein) and Hayley Pulizzi (as the prudish Elizabeth, his fiancée). The story line mostly sticks close to the 45-year-old movie version, and Brooks has enlivened key naughty moments with songs like "Roll in the Hay" and "Please Don't Touch Me."
7:30 p.m. Friday-Saturday, 3 p.m. Sunday, Marlene Boll Theatre at the Boll Family YMCA Theatre, Detroit. 313-993-3270. detroitmercyarts.universitytickets.com. $15-$30.
More than 60 about-to-graduate Cranbrook students will showcase their work starting Saturday at the 2019 GRADUATE DEGREE EXHIBITION OF CRANBROOK ACADEMY OF ART, which will fill all the upper galleries of the Cranbrook Art Museum. The show will feature pieces that are the culmination of two years of studio work from students in 10 academy departments, including 2D and 3D design, architecture, metalsmithing, fiber and photography. An opening reception starts at 6 p.m. Saturday and is free to Cranbrook's ArtMembers. Non-members pay $20 at the door. The exhibit continues through May 12.
Cranbrook Art Museum, Bloomfield Hills. 248-645-3323. cranbrookartmuseum.org. Regular hours: 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday. $6-$10.
Organizers of the NOVI HOME & GARDEN SHOW say they've added significant square footage to this year's event and they're eager to show it off to southeast Michiganders interested in turning their backyard into an outdoor living area featuring cushion-y furniture, an entertainment system and even a kitchen. You can walk through 20,000 square feet of landscaped outdoor settings that include fountains and water features, enormous plants, fire pits, hot tubs and more. At the Plant Michigan Green Stage, visitors with green thumbs can listen in on presentations about outdoor entertaining, yard care and landscaping or get a head start on their garden at the event's plant sales. If your summer to-do list includes projects a bit more down-to-earth or practical, fear not. You'll have a chance to talk to pros about kitchen and bathroom remodels, basement upgrades, waterproofing and attic insulation.
2-8 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Saturday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday, Suburban Collection Showplace, Novi. novihomeshow.com. $10 ages 13 and older, $9 ages 55 and older, free to children 12 and younger.
"NEW MONEY" harkens back to the 1970s New Hollywood movement — think "Five Easy Pieces" or "The Last Detail" — that used location shooting and quirky realism to find something universal in specific journeys. The movie focuses on Debbie Tisdale (Louisa Krause of Showtime's "Billions) and her boyfriend, Steve, (Brendan Sexton III of Netflix's "Russian Doll"), a financially struggling pair of opioid addicts who are desperate to get their hands on the five-figure inheritance that Debbie is being denied because of her drug problems. Director-writer Jason B. Kohl, who grew up in Lansing and shot the film in Lansing, Detroit and other Michigan locales, was an artist-in-residence at Michigan State University in 2015 and prepped and filmed his narrative feature debut around that time.
Arriving Tuesday on Blu-Ray/DVD and through VOD on Amazon, iTunes, YouTube and other streaming platforms.
Metro Detroit husband-and-wife artists Nancy and Russell Thayer are uniting for "PAS DE DEUX," another of their joint shows, starting Friday at the Robert Kidd Gallery in Birmingham. Painter Nancy Thayer, whose work can be found at the Detroit Institute of Arts, museums in Poland and Hungary and in 100-plus private and corporate collections, recently completed a series of two-color "Diversity" paintings aimed at illustrating "the beauty and harmony of diverse identities living side by side." She is also known for her intense mountainscapes, which focus on what she calls the spiritual-emotional aspects of the wilderness. Meanwhile, sculptor Russell Thayer, a veteran Michigan art educator, creates small bronze figures and large aluminum sculptures that reflect his love for architecture, dance, poetry, history, and hard manual labor. "All these components have influenced and informed my work," he said in a statement about the exhibit.
Opening reception is 5-8 p.m. Friday at the Robert Kidd Gallery, Birmingham. 248-642-3909. robertkiddgallery.com. Regular hours: 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Saturday.
Local artists are the stars of the fifth annual DETROIT ARTIST BAZAAR, which kicks off at noon Saturday in the newly restored Hubbard Ballroom at the Ford Community & Performing Arts Center. More than 100 artists and artisans – all from the Detroit area – will be showing their paintings and prints, sculptures, fiber art and jewelry as well as items found less often at art fairs. We're talking beaded garden art, terrariums, handmade soaps and candles, and original jigsaw puzzles. Admission is free, and the participating artists get to keep 100% of what they make. Food trucks will be on the premises for art shoppers who work up an appetite.
Noon-8 p.m. Saturday, Ford Community & Performing Arts Center, Dearborn. detroitartistbazaar.com. Free.
The world of 24/7 broadcast news comes in for a skewering in "TRAGEDY: A TRAGEDY," the Puzzle Piece Theatre production that is finishing its run this weekend in Ferndale. As well-regarded playwright Will Eno's work gets under way, the sun has set at the end of another day, and an overwrought TV news team, eager to fill time, alarm viewers and ramp up ratings, begins to speculate on what the sudden darkness means and whether the sun will ever rise again. (Sound familiar, CNN viewers?) Eno, a Pulitzer finalist for 2004's "Thom Paine (based on nothing)" and acclaimed for 2014 Broadway play "The Realistic Joneses," has been compared to the absurdist playwrights of the mid-20th century. The New York Times labeled him "a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation." D.B. Schroeder is directing the local staging, which concludes the Puzzle Piece company's 2018-19 season.
8 p.m. Friday-Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday, Slipstream Theatre Initiative, Ferndale. 248-291-7188. puzzlestage.org. $20.

Texto completo: Guillermo del Toro's "Hellboy" airs on Syfy ahead of the series' imminent reboot. And a zombie spinoff hits Netflix.
What's on TV
HELLBOY (2004) 8:30 p.m. on Syfy. Hellboy, the cigar-chomping, lobster-colored satanic superhero born of Mike Mignola's comics in the 1990s, was brought to larger audiences by this Guillermo del Toro-directed romp. Wittier and infused with a sweeter disposition than the average big-screen comic book adaptation -- though still plenty violent -- del Toro's movie casts Ron Perlman ("Sons of Anarchy") as the title character, a demon with a devil tail whose origins involve both Grigori Rasputin and an interdimensional portal built by Nazis. (It's complicated.) He winds up working for a government agency (secret, naturally) that defends against paranormal threats. His fellow agents there include an amphibious man played by Doug Jones (who would later play another fish-man in del Toro's "The Shape of Water") and a woman with pyrotechnic abilities (Selma Blair). In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell wrote that del Toro "lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable." It will be interesting to see what the director Neil Marshall brings to the series when his reboot, also called "Hellboy," hits theaters on Friday.
What's Streaming
35 SHOTS OF RUM (2009) Stream on Fandor. The French filmmaker Claire Denis, whose "High Life" has a spaceship-dwelling Robert Pattinson currently brooding on the big screens, turned her attention to more terrestrial concerns in this slow-burner. The movie centers on Lionel (Alex Descas), a widower who operates commuter rail cars for a living, and Joséphine (Mati Diop), his university student daughter. The pair live together in a non-central Paris neighborhood, going through quiet routines that get rocked slightly by the romantic attentions of a pair of neighbors, Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue) and Noé (Grégoire Colin). While a slow separation between father and daughter is the film's clearest focus, A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times that "its real drama is in quiet moments, in glances and whispers captured by Agnès Godard's exquisite and expressive cinematography."
TYREL (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Jason Mitchell plays the odd man out on a nightmarish retreat to the Catskills in this comedy-drama. What was supposed to be an innocuous birthday party for a friend of a friend turns into something more sinister, thanks in part to the fact that the flock of partyers are young white men whose drunk antics do little to help Tyler (who is black) feel like anything other than an outsider. Michael Cera arrives late in the movie, as a rich kid with a Trump piñata.
BLACK SUMMER Stream on Netflix. Syfy's not-entirely-serious zombie apocalypse series "Z Nation" gets the spinoff treatment here, in the form of an eight-episode story of a mother (Jaime King) traversing the plains of zombie-land in search of her missing daughter. Assuming that it follows the lead of its mother series, expect tongue-in-decomposed-cheek action.

Texto completo: If you only went by the media’s coverage of his not-yet-official campaign, you’d think South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg was shooting to the top of the Democratic presidential primary polls.

But he’s not in any national polls. He hasn’t even said whether he’s officially running for the party’s nomination.

Buttigieg is the new Beto.

During former Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s run for Senate in Texas, the press turned him into a Kennedy.

The fawning attention apparently led O'Rourke to believe he should run for president, despite having lost his Senate race.

Now the opposite is happening to 37-year-old Buttigieg. There’s no obvious reason he thinks he might run for president, but he’s getting the same gauzy treatment.

Politico on Wednesday found it newsworthy that some conservatives have — whoa! — said nice things about him. A story at the website noted that Buttigieg was “getting rare praise from some unlikely voices,” like Rush Limbaugh, who on his radio show had called the Whoville-esque mayor “personable.”

Rare praise!

Vanity Fair in late March heralded Buttigieg’s “smarts and charisma.”

The New York Times said Buttigieg was “making waves” after “a series of well-received appearances on national TV.” (Well received by who? The media, naturally.)

You can always count on the media to determine who’s up and who’s down in a campaign simply by nature of declaring it so.

Kamala Harris is a serious contender! Cory Booker is a front-runner! Bernie Sanders is a threat!

Yet, to the extent that you can find out Buttigieg’s actual policy positions, you see that he’s a standard pro-higher taxes, pro-open borders, pro-single-payer healthcare Democrat. He just happens to be gay and talk about God in public. But even that attribute is a muddy mess.

In an interview with USA Today last week, he said it was “hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God.” But it was apparently an act of deep faith when Buttigieg prevented a pro-life group from opening near an abortion clinic in his city.

Like Beto O’Rourke before him, Buttigieg is the media’s new plaything. That doesn’t automatically make him a serious candidate.

Say, what ever happened to O’Rourke anyway?

"We have some of the best wineries and chefs in our region sharing their masterpieces for our guests to enjoy at this year's festival," said Danielle Beaudine, director of marketing at the Coeur d'Alene Resort in a news release. "There's a natural connection between enjoying great food and wine and appreciating incredible art and writing.

A Doubleback Wine Dinner is also scheduled for Friday evening featuring a meal by Beverly's executive chef, Jim Barrett, paired with award-winning wines from Doubleback Winery, owned by former NFL quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
Saturday events begin with a brunch bar, yoga or a guided hike of Tubbs Hill, followed by wine tasting classes, a cocktail class and a choice of lunch at Cedars Floating Restaurant; a Barrister Winemaker lunch at Beverly's; a Amavi Cellars Walla Walla Wine lunch or a Townshend Cellars Lunch on the Green at the Floating Green Restaurant.
Attendees can sample several of Idaho's finest wines at the Artist Den and Idaho Wine Tasting event Saturday afternoon from 1 to 6 p.m. while viewing work by three regional artists: Ben Joyce, Melissa Cole and Jesse Pierpoint.
Sunday festival events feature a signature brunch at Dockside and a "sip and signing" with New York Times and USA Today best-selling author Debbie Macomber, who's sold more than 200 million books with six novels adapted into made-for-TV movies. Macomber is introducing her newest book, "Be a Blessing, A Journal for Cultivating Kindness, Joy and Inspiration," at the event.
A grand wine tasting event will follow from 2 to 5 p.m. with demonstrations on preparing ceviche and lobster rolls from Spokane chef Chad White, who competed in season 13 of Bravo TV's "Top Chef."
The festival is held in partnership with the Coeur d'Alene Downtown Association's Wine Extravaganza on Saturday.
Individual festival events range from $10 to $225.

Reed has confidence outpacing his resume

Texto completo: Golf fans at the Masters are more polite than a teenager getting pulled over by the cops.
They roared for Rory McIlroy after he was nearly disqualified in 2009 over a possible rules violation in a bunker. They cheered for Tiger Woods in 2010 while a plane flew overhead with a banner reading: "TIGER: DID YOU MEAN BOOTYISM?"
It's an easy audience, a just-happy-to-be-here crowd that craves little more than birdies and barbecue sandwiches.
Yet when Patrick Reed won the Masters last year, the gallery around No. 18 responded with yawns and a golf clap. It's as if the spectators forgot that Reed was a Ryder Cup hero nicknamed "Captain America" -- or that he led Augusta State, the school down the road, to national titles in 2010 and 2011.
Actually, they knew all too well about Reed's past, which includes accusations of cheating during a college tournament and stealing from teammates at Georgia, his original college, and his estrangement from his family, who live six miles from Augusta National but were not welcome on the course.
The crowd instead pulled for Jordan Spieth, who threatened to break the Masters record for greatest Sunday comeback; Rickie Fowler, whose 14-under total fell one shot shy; and McIlroy, who fumbled his chance for a career Grand Slam.
Reed noticed that McIlroy, his playing partner, got a louder ovation when they were introduced on the first tee.
"That played into my hand," Reed said last year on Sunday. "Fueled my fire."
Reed returns to Augusta National this week lighter -- yet with similar baggage.
He looks great in his green jacket, having shed a dozen pounds.
"The reason I lost a little is because of tonight," he joked Tuesday, referring to his Champions Dinner menu of ribeye steak and sides such as creamed spinach and mac and cheese. "I need to leave a little room to be able to fit back into it."
But the baggage is such that Reed hasn't won a tournament since leaving the grounds last year.
He chose to air some dirty laundry after the United States got thumped in the Ryder Cup, piling on captain Jim Furyk and his downtrodden teammates. And he told the New York Times he "wouldn't at all be surprised" if alienated family members show up to watch him this week.
Reed's security detail asked to have his father, Bill, removed from the 2014 U.S. Open at Pinehurst, with a USGA official telling the Times that Bill's badge was taken away after he made "intimidating movements" toward Reed's wife, Justine. (The Reeds have declined to comment.)
Patrick's father and sister, Hannah, traveled to Paris to watch the Ryder Cup. And they will be allowed on the Augusta National grounds if they choose, as long as they follow the rules of etiquette in the tournament spectator guide: Do not cheer a player's misfortune.
Asked on Tuesday if it's important to be well-liked by the Masters spectators, Reed sidestepped, saying: "I feel like I have a lot of fans around here. One great thing about the sport we play is that a lot of the fans respect great golf."
Reed, 28, is famously cocky, calling himself "one of the top five players in the world" when he was 23. He had yet to even play in a major. He rose to 11th after winning the Masters -- three spots off his best -- and enters this week 18th.
The odds of him becoming the first defending Masters champion to win since Woods in 2002 are 50-1, via BetOnline.ag. There are 23 players with a better shot, according to the books.
Reed's last four results were a tie for 24th in the WGC Match Play, a missed cut at Tampa, a T-47 in the Players Championship and a T-50 at Bay Hill.
That doesn't bode well. But Reed believes it's harder to win a first Masters than a second.
"Once you get over that hurdle," he said, "your confidence goes even higher."

Washington's swamp rats cling to their hoax

Texto completo: For the Democrats, it's still all about the collusion narrative.
They don't care that the Mueller Report concluded that Donald Trump's campaign and the Russians did not cooperate to steal the 2016 election.
President Trump's crazed enemies in Congress and in the liberal media will never believe Trump won fair and square.
You can give the House committees headed by Democrats Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler two more years of digging around in Trump World for impeachable crimes.
You can give them 800 pages, a thousand pages, ten-thousand more pages of interviews. You can give them another $30 million to waste on lawyers and investigators. They won't find anything, but it won't matter.
The "Russia collusion" narrative of the Trump Hating Industrial Complex will never die.
The Democrats just "know" that the epic tragedy of Hillary Clinton's defeat could only have happened because Donald Trump cheated.
The president himself was never under investigation for collusion. Yes, but, but, but, the Democrats say, his son took that meeting with a Russian woman peddling dirt on Hillary.
And his national security adviser for 24 days, Michael Flynn, met with that jolly Russian ambassador.
And his longtime pal Roger Stone supposedly tried to get more hacked Hillary emails from Wikileaks.
It wasn't against the law for Trump's son or the others to meet with or talk to those Russians, by the way. In the deranged minds of Trump haters and the liberal media, however, those and a few other brief encounters with Russians by Trump underlings are solid proof of collusion.
But Muller and his gang of lawyers, including several who were closely connected with the Clinton mob, obviously didn't agree. No collusion, no obstruction was their verdict.
Meanwhile, while we wait for Attorney General Bill Barr to release the full but redacted Mueller Report, I wonder how long it'll take the liberal mainstream media to investigate the folks who really colluded with the Russians in 2016 — the Democrats.
Their collusion was instigated by Hillary's campaign and the Democratic National Committee when they paid the research company Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump.
Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, an ex-British spy, who created a fake, salacious dossier on Donald Trump that Hillary partisans in the highest offices of the FBI used to get FISA surveillance warrants against low-level Trump staffers like George Papadopoulos.
So far, Fox News, talk radio and conservatives in Congress have been the only ones talking about or investigating the partisan origins and FBI's misuse of the so-called "Steele dossier."
You'd think the crack investigative journalists at the New York Times or Washington Post would be covering the heck out of this shocking and dangerous abuse of power by the FBI.
You'd think they'd want to expose how far the Democrats and some top political appointees in the FBI were willing to go to prevent someone they didn't like from becoming president.
But so far, the great institutions of the liberal news media are sticking to the "Trump Collusion" script.
They hope to find new stuff in the footnotes of the Mueller Report to fit their Russian collusion narrative, which they refuse to accept has turned out to be the political hoax the president always said it was.
With the economy strong, black and Latino employment at their highest levels and a trade deal with China in the works, the Russian collusion narrative is the only issue the Democrats have.
You know the Muller team tried its best to get anything they could to nail President Trump on collusion. But they came up with zip, ultimately because they were professionals.
Unfortunately, the Democrats in the House running their purely political sideshows are not professionals interested in fairness or the truth.
Schiff and Nadler are partisan, power-hungry hacks who are out to do whatever they can to stymie Trump's agenda and prevent his reelection chances.
Michael Reagan is the son of President Ronald Reagan.

Baldwin says, 'Beating Trump would be so easy'

Texto completo: Alec Baldwin, who won an Emmy Award for spoofing President Donald Trump on "Saturday Night Live," is teasing the idea of running for president himself.
"If I ran for President, would you vote for me?" the Massapequa-raised actor, 61, tweeted Tuesday. "I won't ask you for any $. And I promise I will win. Beating Trump would be so easy. So easy. So easy."
About 25 minutes later he added, "These tweets save me millions in polling."
A host of Trump supporters reacted negatively, many posting personal insults. Trump, who often has lambasted the actor for his "SNL" parodies, did not comment on Twitter. It was unclear how serious Baldwin was being, and his spokeswoman told Newsday the actor was not commenting.
Baldwin has spoken offhandedly for years about running for political office, telling Interview magazine in 1989 that before discovering his vocation for acting, he had attended college in Washington, D.C., for three years, intending to go on to law school. "I wanted to be President of the United States," he said. "I really did. The older I get, the less preposterous the idea seems."
He told The New York Times in 2006, in response to a hypothetical question of what his ideal office would be, that, "If I ever ran for anything, the thing I would like to be is governor of New York." When asked for his qualifications, Baldwin pointed to bodybuilder-actor turned California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and said, "I'm Tocqueville compared to [him]." The 19th century French sociologist Alexis de Tocqueville wrote the 1835 book "Democracy in America," a still-influential political text.
In August 2011, following speculation he might run for New York City mayor, Baldwin told the Times that due to contractual obligations to the NBC comedy "30 Rock," for which he won two Emmys, and because of his desire to obtain a master's degree in politics and government first, he would sit out the 2013 election. He reiterated in a Bloomberg TV interview in April 2012 that he remained open to the possibility. 
Besides Schwarzenegger and former actor Ronald Reagan, who served as U.S. president from 1981 to 1989, numerous entertainers have been elected to high office, including singer and California Rep. Sonny Bono, comedian and Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, "The Love Boat" actor and Iowa Rep. Fred Grandy, actor and Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson, and pro wrestler and Minnesota governor Jesse Ve

Texto completo: The Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby is bringing her eye-opening humor back to New York this summer with her new solo show, "Douglas."
The show had its world premiere at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival last month. Ms. Gadsby will kick off an American tour in San Francisco on April 29 and will close it with a four-week run Off Broadway at the Daryl Roth Theater beginning July 23.
In "Douglas," named after Ms. Gadsby's dog, the comic discusses her autism diagnosis, which she received before working on her breakout show, "Nanette." Now she feels ready to unpack it in front of an audience.
"Nanette" played in Australia and Britain for 18 months, scooped up prizes in Melbourne and Edinburgh, had a run at SoHo Playhouse in New York and then became a Netflix special that introduced Ms. Gadsby to the rest of the world.
The show turned stand-up comedy onto its head -- many argued it wasn't comedy at all. In it, Ms. Gadsby dissected stand-up as an art form, shared what it was like growing up gay in Tasmania and tore into the culture that has historically kept men on top, no matter their flaws. She even announced she was giving up comedy.
"Quitting was always a theatrical device, and I'm delighted everyone took it so seriously," Ms. Gadsby said in a recent interview with The New York Times. "But that theatrical device, as I relived trauma night after night, felt really good to say it and mean it. I think I meant it and still mean it in the sense of the strictest definition of what comedy is -- yeah, I've quit that."
Ms. Gadsby has written about her post-"Nanette" success and diagnosis in a new memoir, "Ten Steps to Nanette." It will hit bookstores later this year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICY OBSESSION BORDERS ON IRRATIONAL

Texto completo: Donald Trump's purging of top leaders at the Department of Homeland Security illustrates just how extreme the president's immigration policy has become.
Trump forced out Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Sunday. That followed his rescinding last week of his nomination of Ronald Vitiello to be director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying he wanted to go in a "tougher" direction. Then, on Monday, U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph Alles was ousted.
There's more to come, The New York Times reports. L. Francis Cissna, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and John Mitnick, the department's general counsel and a senior member of Nielsen's leadership team, will soon leave, too.
The timing couldn't be worse. If ever there was a time our country needed to compromise on immigration issues, this is it. But Trump's uninterested in compromise. He's focused on separating families, building a wall and sealing the border with Mexico. The president's promise of a border wall may have helped put him in the White House in 2016. But he has turned it into an irrational obsession.
And a costly one. The mindless effort to use the wall as a political bargaining chip in January led to the government shutdown, which cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
When Nielsen isn't tough enough for Trump, that's troubling. The Homeland Security secretary was widely known as the most aggressive person to hold the position. It was Nielsen who presided over the separation of thousands of families in 2018. But it was her refusal to reinstate the policy in recent weeks that led to her departure.
Nielsen, according to reports, asked for a meeting Sunday with Trump seeking "a way forward" on the border issue. But the president, who has been delivering the message to migrants to "go back where you came from" because "we're full," refused to budge. Trump is now moving to fill the Homeland Security position with someone on board with his extreme anti-immigration views.
Meanwhile, days, weeks and years keep passing without comprehensive immigration reform. It's a tragic loss to the nation.
As Bay Area Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, points out, we're a nation of immigrants, from industrialist Andrew Carnegie to Google's Sergey Brin, who have brought innovations to our shores that have helped the country prosper.
The president should embrace the notion that we can both secure our borders without a 2,000-mile wall and still attract the best and brightest minds from around the world to further spur our economy. He needs to surround himself with people who understand that immigrants play a crucial role in supplying the workforce our country needs.
Trump's latest purge signals a deplorable shift away from America's most treasured values.

Barr says Mueller report will be released to public 'within a week'

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr said he will be ready to release his redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's final report to the public within a week.

During a House Appropriations panel hearing on the proposed Justice Department budget, Barr was prompted by Democrats to discuss the Russia investigation.

In response to a question from Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., the chairman of the subcommittee holding the hearing, Barr said his initial timetable for providing Congress with a redacted version of the report still stands.

"This process is going along very well, and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid April stands," Barr testified. "So I think that, from my standpoint, by, within a week, I'll be in a position to release the report to the public and then I will engage with the chairman of both Judiciary committees about that report and about any further requests that they have."

Barr provided a four-page summary of Mueller's roughly 400-page report to Congress last month which said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. The summary also said Mueller did not find President Trump committed obstruction of justice, but Mueller also did not exonerate the president. However, Barr said he concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a crime.

In a follow-up letter on March 29, Barr identified four categories of information that will not be made public, including material related to grand jury proceedings which by law cannot be made public, information deemed by the intelligence community to compromise sensitive sources and methods, details that could affect other ongoing investigations — including those referred by the special counsel’s office to other offices — and material that would “unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.”

Barr testified Tuesday that Mueller did not help him draft either letter to Congress, and although he invited the special counsel's team to review the correspondence they elected no to do so.

Democrats have accused Barr of trying to hide damning information about Trump from Mueller's Russia investigation under the guise of redactions.

Further adding fuel to their ire were reports last week from the New York Times and Washington Post in which anonymous sources said members of Mueller's team were frustrated with the way Barr portrayed the findings of their years-long investigation in a four-page summary. Reacting to those reports, Trump tore into Mueller's team on Sunday, accusing the "angry Democrats" of "illegally leaking" information to the media.

Although Barr said he is working with Mueller to release a redacted version of the final report for Congress to read this month, the Judiciary Committee, ruled by Democrats, voted last week in favor of subpoenaing Barr to turn over the entire Mueller report.

However, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said Tuesday his panel will not actually issue a subpoena for Mueller's full report until they see the redacted version provided by Barr.

Bipartisan threat: Senate leaders warn Turkey sanctions will follow its purchase of Russian missiles

Texto completo: The Republican chairmen and ranking Democrats of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees have issued a blunt warning to Turkey: Give up plans to buy Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles or kiss the American F-35 goodbye.

“It will not have both,” the senators vow in an op-ed in the New York Times, which is intended as a direct message to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a day after he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and said he would proceed with the deal to buy the Russian air defense system, which the United States says would compromise the high-tech stealth of the F-35.

“No one can expect us to give up this,” Erdogan told reporters, arguing that as a sovereign country Turkey cannot accept foreign interference.

If that’s the case, the bipartisan group of Senate leaders warns, Erdogan will face “profound consequences for his country’s place in the world, its relationship with the United States and its standing in NATO.”

The op-ed, written by the Armed Services Committee's Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., and the Foreign Relations Committee's Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., threatens Turkey with crippling sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

“Sanctions will hit Turkey’s economy hard — rattling international markets, scaring away foreign direct investment and crippling Turkey’s aerospace and defense industry,” they write. “Further, no F-35s will ever reach Turkish soil. And Turkish participation in the F-35 program, including manufacturing parts, repairing and servicing the fighters, will be terminated, taking Turkish companies out of the manufacturing and supply chain for the program.”

Turkey has already bought and paid for four F-35As, which are at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where Turkish pilots are learning to fly them. The country is one of eight international partners that help build the Lockheed Martin jet, making parts of the fuselage and cockpit displays.

“Turkey is an important partner in the F-35 program, but it is not irreplaceable,” the senators say. The Pentagon announced last week that it was seeking secondary sources of supply for Turkish-produced F-35 parts “to ensure prudent program planning and resiliency of the F-35 supply chain.”

Turkey has already invested more than $1.25 billion in the F-35 program, and planned to purchase 100 F-35s. The senators say that investment will be “squandered,” and Turkey will be forced to settle for a less-capable fighter aircraft that will not arrive for many years.

“Turkish companies that produce parts for the F-35 will see their orders dry up completely. Its F-35 engine maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade facility will see all its work go to other facilities in Europe,” they write. “President Erdogan’s hope to make the Turkish defense industry a key pillar of economic growth for the future will be dashed.”

America can't risk allowing Russian radars close access to its fifth-generation fighter aircraft, the senators say. "The S-400 is the most advanced system produced to date in Russia’s quest to defeat stealth technology — the system Russia built to shoot down the F-35 fighters."

The lawmakers say Congress is ready to help if Russia punishes Turkey for pulling out of the program. "We understand that Turkey has a relationship of necessity with Russia — on Syria, energy, agriculture, tourism and more," they write. "If President Erdogan walks away from the S-400, Mr. Putin may retaliate in one or more of these areas. In that unfortunate event, we commit to do all we can to assist Turkey as it weathers the storm."

What $780 million buys

Texto completo: In 2014, Mayor de Blasio said the flagship school-turnaround program he was unveiling would deliver never-before-seen academic gains in New York City's most troubled public schools.
"We will demand fast and intense improvement - and we will see that it happens," he promised.
A just-released independent analysis by outside experts of the first two years of results, a report New Yorkers paid for with their tax dollars but that City Hall long kept from public view, reveals that the mayor and schools chancellor had powerful evidence that was not what the Renewal Schools initiative were delivering. Not at all.
"We defined success as whether most of the schools could move substantially in the right direction - and that, we got," is how de Blasio shaded the truth when, late last year, he announced the end of the program, after the New York Times got ahold of the independent report.
Oh, really? The RAND Corporation's study systematically compared schools in the program to those with achievement levels that just missed the cutoff for entry. While it found modest improvements in student attendance, reductions in chronic absenteeism and high-school credit attainment, it also discovered slightly worse dropout rates at Renewal Schools than in the control group.
And, wrote the authors, "We find no statistically significant effect of the program on student achievement measures" - like test scores - "nor do we find any statistically significant effects on any of the measures in the New York City Quality Review rubric."
Four years. $780 million dollars. Precious little to show, except an unwillingness to learn hard lessons.

A Fungus Shrouded in Secrecy

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In 30 years, I've never faced so tough a reporting challenge -- and one so unexpected. Who wouldn't want to talk about a fungus?
Last year, I began spade work on a series of articles about drug-resistant microbes: bacteria and fungi that have developed the ability to evade common medicines that we have used for decades.
Early on, I stumbled onto a compelling example. A woman in Alaska named Sari Bailey woke up one morning with green and yellow gunk coming out of her ear. Her doctor told her it was an ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. They didn't work. Turns out she had a drug-resistant infection that rooted on her mastoid bone, just behind the ear. It nearly killed her and required multiple surgeries to clear.
Her experience showed the pronounced risk of these tenacious bugs and seemed like a good way to draw readers into a story about a very complex scientific topic. But I needed more details, and I needed context: How common was this? What was the science behind it?
When I went looking for answers, I hit my first curious wall. A hospital in Alaska declined my request to speak with a local doctor who has a lot of experience treating people with drug-resistant infections, including another woman who had been hospitalized for seven months fighting a drug-resistant staph infection.
Getting turned away is just another day at work for a reporter. But what made this incident unusual is that, in my experience, the medical community is generally eager to get the word out about public health issues.
From this germ of an observation grew one of the most curious aspects of our series: The rise in resistant bugs is cloaked in widespread and chronic secrecy.
As our reporting continued, we discovered it was common for hospitals, doctors and public health agencies to clam up when it came to talking about their troubles with resistant bugs, though they widely acknowledged the existence of the problem and even encouraged our efforts. This disconnect was at its most extreme when the issue turned to the subject of the first article in our series, which was published online on Saturday -- Candida auris.
C. auris is a drug-resistant fungus that has emerged mysteriously around the world, and it is understood to be a clear and present danger. But Connecticut state officials wouldn't tell us the name of the hospital where they had had a C. auris patient, let alone connect us with her family. Neither would officials in Texas, where the woman was transferred and died. A spokeswoman for the City of Chicago, where C. auris has become rampant in long-term health care facilities, promised to find a family and then stopped returning my calls without explanation.
There were rays of light. The State of New York, where many have died, told us they tried to connect us with families of people who had fallen ill, as did a Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital. But one after another withdrew. "They've backed out," a hospital official told my colleague Andrew Jacobs when we were hours from an interview with relatives of a C. auris patient who had died.
My emails to a researcher about C. auris in India, which has dealt with many cases, went unanswered, and that soon became common -- emails and calls just not returned. We put a call-out on the New York Times website asking to speak to families affected by C. auris, recognizing this came with the risk of tipping off others to our work, and got nary a bite.
We came to realize that the secrecy surrounding C. auris was a big part of the story. A doctor in Spain wrote me that the hospital didn't want bad press by seeming to be a hotbed of the fungus. I got the same message from a doctor in England. One doctor in New York told me that patients, and their families, don't like being associated with the illness, as if they had a scarlet letter -- "A" for auris.
The stakes are growing. The issue goes well beyond that one fungus. Ms. Bailey's bacterial infection continues to plague her. This week, she will have her gallbladder removed, thanks to complications from multiple courses of antibiotics and steroids used to treat her vexing infection, her family said.
As we prepare to move ahead with more articles on drug resistance, we understand that we are tackling an issue that is so scary, it feels easy for some people to ignore, less frightening to bury.
If our series gets more people talking, that would be a victory.

Texto completo: Three ProPublica projects have been named finalists for Deadline Club Awards in the annual contest honoring the best work by journalists in the New York City area.
“The Right to Fail,” a collaboration with PBS Frontline, is a finalist in the Newspaper or Digital Local News Reporting category. Led by ProPublica reporter Joaquin Sapien and filmmaker Tom Jennings, the investigation focused on a New York policy to move people out of institutions and into private apartments, revealing that social workers felt pressured to move individuals even when they were not good candidates for living on their own. Lacking the structure of institutions, it became much easier for individuals to slip through the cracks, with dangerous, dehumanizing and sometimes fatal results.
The day after our report co-published in the New York Times, federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who originally approved the 2014 settlement that resulted in the supported-housing policy, ordered an independent report to assess the effectiveness of its incident reporting system. Garaufis also got state officials to commit to examining their service-coordination program and suggested they develop a program to help residents learn basic life skills in supported housing.
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Crisis, a collaboration with the New York Times, is a finalist in the Business Investigative Reporting category. The series of investigations by ProPublica senior editor Charles Ornstein and New York Times reporter Katie Thomas detailed undisclosed relationships between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and for-profit health care companies, highlighting conflicts of interest. A story on Dr. José Baselga, MSK’s chief medical officer, detailed his failure to disclose corporate board memberships and payments from companies connected to cancer research in his published research articles, even when he was reporting on the results of studies conducted by those companies. Baselga resigned from his job at MSK within days, after initially insisting his conduct was appropriate and ethical, and he later stepped down as one of the editors-in-chief of Cancer Discovery, a prominent medical journal.
Following the series, MSK’s CEO, Dr. Craig Thompson, also resigned from his seats on the boards of Merck and Charles River Laboratories and made new conflict disclosures, as did other MSK staff. MSK additionally announced that a vice president who oversees hospital ventures with for-profit companies would turn over to the hospital a nearly $1.4 million stake in a biotech company that he received for representing MSK on the company’s board.
“The Billion-Dollar Loophole,” co-published with Fortune, was nominated in the Business Feature category. The investigation by senior reporter Peter Elkind exposed a popular charitable donation tax scheme for the very rich that is being manipulated to make big profits, and how it’s costing the government billions in lost revenue.

Commentary: It’s Norman Vincent Peale’s America

Texto completo: If Americans ever lived in a Billy Graham nation, they do so no longer. They live now in a nation defined by Norman Vincent Peale, though few Americans today may even know this name.
It is Peale’s influence that permeates the cultural landscape. He is a founder of our secular religion of achievement and well-being. His vision is echoed in the mystical certainties of figures like Oprah Winfrey. Even the Trump presidency is confirmation that our country is now Normal Vincent Peale’s America.
Certainly, Graham was the exemplar and perhaps the culmination of a religious tide that blanketed the whole of American history until his day. Even before the nation was officially born, there was a Billy Graham-style religious revival that first fashioned a people and then prepared them for the revolution to come. Historians have called this Great Awakening the “first intercolonial event.”
During the mid-1700s, from Georgia to Maine, the urgent call to reclaim faith in God swept the rising nation. There were prominent preachers, like George Whitefield. There were massive crowds that impressed even Founding Fathers like Benjamin Franklin. There were advance teams. There was fiery newspaper coverage. Tens of thousands were converted, and a “spirit of liberty” was celebrated throughout the land — all just before the revolution that gave Americans a place among the nations of the world.
More than one historian has concluded that had there been no religious revival at the time there would have been no American Revolution — at least, not a successful one.
It was much the same after the revolution, which had damaged the cause of religion. Firebrand preachers like Charles Finney urged vast crowds to return to the God of their fathers and take their fledgling nation with them. The transforming power of this movement is hard to exaggerate. Entire towns were so impacted that they changed their names to those of biblical cities like Bethel or Shiloh. Benevolent societies arose that endure to this day.
This pattern was often repeated. War and cultural crisis were followed by raucous revivals. There would be champions of faith like Dwight Moody or Billy Sunday. Millions were impacted. The media was riveted. New institutions of faith arose. The wider nation could not help but take note.
It was this heritage of revivalistic faith that helped feed the stunning rise of Billy Graham in the late 1950s. Americans were urged to return to God and thus to the God of their fathers, to the God who ruled over the American experience. Be born again and in so doing restore the nation to its divine purpose, immense audiences were told. The appeal of this message made Graham’s crusades prime-time media events. He became the “Pastor to Presidents,” the most influential clergyman of his age.
Yet even before Graham became prominent, Norman Vincent Peale was fashioning a new faith for a new age. He was a gifted orator who in 1932 became the minister of the esteemed Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan. Initially, he preached a “born again gospel,” much as Graham would later.
Peale was eager, though, to find language to inspire his sophisticated, business-obsessed Manhattan congregation. He began moving away from biblical theology in favor of motivational psychology. He came to believe that “given a normal intelligence, an individual can make of himself about what he wants to be.” He spoke of the Sermon on the Mount as a “practical program for personality building.”
His popularity soared as he introduced the wider world to the principles of self-improvement and achievement made famous in his massive bestseller, “The Power of Positive Thinking.” The book made Peale the most famous Protestant clergyman on earth after it was released in 1952.
His chapter titles tell the tale: “Expect the Best and Get It,” “How to Create Your Own Happiness,” “Inflow of New Thoughts Can Remake You,” “I Don’t Believe in Defeat” and “How to Get People to Like You.”
He taught of a “magnetic force in your mind which by a law of attraction tends to bring the best to you.” He assured his followers that what they “imagine may ultimately become a fact if held mentally with sufficient faith.”
Peale’s own father described this theology as “a composite of Science of Mind (New Thought), metaphysics, Christian Science, medical and psychological practice, Baptist Evangelism, Methodist witnessing, and solid Dutch Reformed Calvinism.”
It is the mention of “Science of Mind” and “New Thought” that is most surprising. Clearly, Peale drew from non-Christian sources to fashion his new faith. He knew that “I am what I think I am” and “I am what God makes me” represent two different faiths. Yet he baptized the former statement and offered it as a replacement for the latter before an eager global audience.
He is father, then, to much of what we know today. When Oprah Winfrey touts the message of the bestselling book and video series “The Secret” — with its core message, “thoughts become things” — she is echoing Peale. When Donald Trump denies facts and prefers bluster, he is echoing the man who called Trump “his greatest student of all time.”
It was Peale, after all, who wrote in “The Power of Positive Thinking” that “Attitudes are more important than facts.”
Indeed, whenever the internet sizzles with admonitions like, “If you can conceive it you can achieve it,” or “Your thoughts determine your destiny,” or “Imagine your way to success,” it is doing so in praise of Peale.
Billy Graham called for lives surrendered to God and guided by faith in Jesus Christ. It was the cry of American revivals past. Peale urged men to think the thoughts that fashioned their realities, to remake themselves with words and attitudes and imaginings centered upon success and acceptance.
We live in a Norman Vincent Peale nation now.
Yet even Peale’s values sound forth from our early national past. It was the visiting French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville who in 1831 complained of American preachers, “It is often difficult to ascertain from their discourse whether the principal object of religion is to procure eternal felicity in the other-world or prosperity in this.”
Still, we should not conclude that the Billy Graham tide in American history is at an end. His brand of evangelicalism is much maligned but is ever bent upon resurrection. The heirs of Graham, believing with him that the ideas of mere men fade quickly from history, may yet rise to reclaim the field from the now triumphant heirs of Norman Vincent Peale.

Texto completo: Nearly a year after his death on April 20, 2018, the album that Swedish electronic music producer Avicii had been working on before his passing is finally being released, his family told The New York Times.
Titled "Tim," after his real name, Tim Bergling, the album will come out in June, with its first single, “S. O. S. ,” arriving on April 10. The album, which was 75% to 80% finished at the time Avicii’s died, is not a bunch of "musical leftovers," the story stressed. It will feature vocals from Chris Martin of Coldplay and Aloe Blacc, the latter of whom sang on Avicii's hit “Wake Me Up. "
Avicii was found dead at 28 during a vacation in Muscat. While declining to go into detail, the Bergling family acknowledged it was a suicide in the Times article.
Last month, his family announced the creation of the Tim Bergling Foundation, which will focus on supporting people and organizations in the field of mental illness and suicide prevention. and will also be active on issues involving climate change, nature conservation and endangered species.
“It’s not even a year since it happened,” Klas Bergling, Avicii's father, told the Times, explaining that while his new music "should be released," his loved ones are still recovering from his death. “The family is very traumatized. We want peace. ”

Artist draws on Confederate history

Texto completo: In a second-floor gallery at the Fabric Workshop and Museum a woman used a dish towel printed with an image of the Confederate battle flag to clean a layer of dust from a section of the Declaration of Independence inscribed on the concrete floor.
The artist Sonya Clark repeatedly dipped the cloth in a metal bucket of water before using slow, circular motions to wash away the dust, revealing 111 words from the Declaration's preamble, beginning: "We hold these truths to be self-evident."
The silent, 20-minute performance accompanied the opening of Clark's exhibition titled "Monumental Cloth, the Flag We Should Know," in which she highlights the little-known Confederate Flag of Truce, a dish towel used by Confederate forces to surrender the Civil War at Appomattox, Virginia, on April 9, 1865.
A huge linen replica of the truce flag, measuring 15 feet by 30 feet, or 10 times the size of the original, has been woven by the museum, and sits in a separate gallery on the eighth floor, near 100 smaller versions of the flag, all woven to scale.
Clark, a professor of art and art history at Amherst College in Massachusetts, is presenting the truce flag as a counterweight to the familiar red and blue battle flag of the Confederacy that is commercially reproduced on merchandise including T-shirts, bumper stickers, and dish towels, and is seen by its critics as a symbol of racism.
That the truce flag - now housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. - is overshadowed in popular culture by the battle flag is, Clark argued, a sign that America has yet to erase a racist past that sparked the Civil War.
"This country has not reckoned with the fact that the Civil War was lost, that we haven't quite come to terms with when that truce was made," she said in an interview after the performance. "It meant that people put down their arms but they didn't actually attend in full to what the war was being fought about."
By giving new prominence to the truce flag through its scale and number at the exhibition, Clark is hoping that people will accept it as the symbol of reconciliation that it was meant to be, in contrast to the battle flag that opponents see as an emblem of division and defiance.
Susan Lubowsky Talbott, executive director of the museum, said the exhibition is especially relevant at a time of renewed white nationalist activity, like the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, where a counter-protester was killed.
"It's so important right now that sadly, the timing for this show couldn't be better," Talbott said. Recognition of the Confederacy is widespread. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported in 2019 that 114 Confederate symbols have been removed since the church attack in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015 - and that 1,747 still stand. Many of these monuments are protected by state laws in the former Confederate states.
Kate Masur, an associate professor of history at Northwestern University, said that drawing attention to the truce flag has the potential to shift public perceptions about the end of the Civil War that are now dominated by the battle flag.
"She's trying to help people imagine what it would have been like if that truce flag had become the flag we all remembered as the Confederate flag," Masur said. "What would be all of the cascading effects if the main Confederate flag that was passed down to us from history was a white flag of truce or a flag of surrender, maybe our history would have turned out very differently. It's a great idea for an artistic project."
The battle flag's associations with white supremacy and no-surrender are not likely to be dislodged among its adherents, Masur said, but people who attend the exhibition may come away with a new perspective. "Will it make people who engage with her exhibit think differently about American history? It certainly could," she said.
The huge truce flag was created in three sections by a commercial weaver in Pennsylvania, and stitched together, Talbott said. The weaver did not have the ability to incorporate three red lines from the original flag, so the lines were handwoven by museum staff after researching dyes that would have been available at the end of the Civil War.
Clark, 52, declined to say whether her use of a cloth printed with the battle flag to clean the gallery floor was an act of provocation, simply noting that the cloth was commercially available. "They are everywhere," she said. (The dust on the gallery floor came from two historic Philadelphia sites, Independence Hall, and the Declaration House, where Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence.) "As a woman of color," she said, "I'm embodying the idea of the domestic worker who is a whole living human being."
Brittany Webb, a curator at the nearby Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, called Clark's performance, titled "Reversals," a provocative and patriotic act that sought to highlight divisions between the battle flag and the founding principles of the Declaration.
"Somebody is using a battle flag to clear away the historical debris to remind everyone that this is an ideal that is supposed to be important to us all," Webb said.
"There's something heavy about the materiality of watching that dirty flag get squeezed out into the bucket over and over again," she said, "literally wiping away the historical dust off a phrase that is supposed to be fundamental, part of the philosophy of the founding of this nation."

Texto completo: A month ago, The New York Times had its editorial page claiming President Donald Trump declared a crisis at America's southern border "contrary to all evidence." It then followed with a story headlined "Border at 'Breaking Point' as More than 76,000 Migrants Cross in a Month."
Well? Which is it?
Ongoing events at the border have provided the answer. Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have been revealingly silent about their claim that Trump was "manufacturing" a crisis, yet they and other Democrats oppose his attempt to move money to pay for his "wall."
These hypocrites had no problem when President Barack Obama set the presidential "pen and phone" precedent, implementing his preferred agenda by executive order in the face of similarly typical congressional inaction. Initially acknowledging having no authority to bypass Congress, Obama proceeded to imperiously change immigration law with his unconstitutional decree authorizing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
President Trump can at least argue for constitutional authority and point to statutory law as he attempts to secure our southern border. He was absolutely correct in declaring a
National emergency over the border "disaster" because that's what it is, according to those charged with protecting that line.
His declaration should not, however, have had anything to do with funding a wall.
If an emergency exists, it's reasonable to ask why building a wall would be the primary focus of the response. Building walls take time. Emergencies require immediate action.
Still, having presidents (Obama's making immigration law and Trump "creatively" funding a wall) bypass Congress with arbitrary executive action is dangerous precedent.
Those who value individual liberty are well aware of ascendant left-wing Democrats, unhinged about the "emergency" of "climate change," who are prepared to effectively shut down our economy and micromanage our lives with their "Green New Deal."
One could easily imagine another left-wing Democratic president declaring an emergency to shut down the fossil fuel segments of our energy sector. After all, when it comes to climate change, we're all doomed if we don't act yesterday. Democrats, too, can undoubtedly imagine numerous actions by Republican presidents they would find unacceptable.
Trump should therefore resist following Obama in creating or manipulating laws. Solving this insanity constitutionally requires Trump to return to the asylum - Capitol Hill - and force its inmates (our so-called "representatives") to cooperate.
With Democrats' sole agenda the re-investigation of Russian collusion and Republicans continuing their role as political cowards, forcing an end to border chaos requires a means that will get the entire nation's attention and leave Congress no choice but to do its job. Trump had threatened to shut down the border, but very recently decided to play the swamp game and kick the can down the road. This capitulation squanders his leverage and, frankly, makes his national "emergency" declaration suspect.
The "wall" has become a political football where the sovereignty and security of our nation, the safety of its citizens and the rule of law are sacrificed to score political points. So Congress fiddles while Rome burns.
As commander-in-chief, Trump has the power to direct the military at all times. He should use those resources to immediately close the southern border. No one in, no one out until Congress passes immigration reform. No separated families. No "children in cages" to demagogue. No commerce. Nothing.
No "side" is going to get everything it wants, but here's betting the selfish-interest groups, businesses, and especially our porous neighbor, Mexico, will force Congress to compromise very quickly.

Texto completo: No fue una sorpresa en Washington la salida de la encargada de implementar las duras políticas migratorias de Donald Trump.
Kirstjen Nielsen, quien estuvo al mando de la política de cero tolerancia en la frontera renunció hoy a la dirección del DHS.
La titular de la cartera de Seguridad Nacional abandonó este domingo el gabinete de Trump después de que éste le hubiera reclamado en público y en privado una mayor dureza en materia migrator ia, aunque sus labores hayan sido criticadas por defensores de derechos humanos en el país.
Nielsen fue la encargada de poner en marcha una agresiva política migratoria abanderada por Trump que ha incluido la separación de familias de inmigrantes con menores cuando cruzaban la frontera con México irregularmente durante meses, un veto migratorio contra países de mayoría musulmana y regulaciones para limitar el asilo en el límite con México.
Sin duda, una de las mayores sombras que quedará en el legado de Nielsen serán los llantos y lamentos desesperados que fueron grabados a los niños inmigrantes separados de sus padres cuando estos estaban detenidos en celdas.
Sin embargo, el desempeño de estas tareas no ha saciado las demandas de Trump de una mayor rigidez en temas migratorios, lo que ha generado múltiples desencuentros internos entre ambos que han sido recogidos por medios locales.
La secretaria saliente fue nominada para dirigir el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) en octubre de 2017 para convertirse en la tercera persona en hacerlo bajo la batuta de Trump, tras el paso del general John Kelly y de la secretaria interina Elaine Duke.
Precisamente, hasta ese momento, Nielsen había sido la jefa de gabinete de Kelly hasta que éste se convirtió en el jefe de Gabinete del presidente.
El general había sido hasta su salida a mediados de diciembre el principal defensor de Nielsen en la Casa Blanca.
Nielsen, una experta en ciberseguridad y gestión de desastres que formó parte del consejo de seguridad nacional durante el Gobierno de George W. Bush (2001-2009), comenzó a trabajar con Kelly a finales de 2016, cuando se encargó de preparar al general, nominado entonces como jefe de DHS, para sus audiencias de confirmación en el Senado.
Kelly quedó entonces impresionado por la dedicación de Nielsen, que tras contagiarse de una severa gripe tosió tanto que se rompió una costilla, y en lugar de tomarse una baja, se vendó el torso y siguió trabajando al mismo ritmo, según la revista Politico.
Dentro del Gobierno de Bush, al que entró en 2004, Nielsen trabajó en la Administración de Transporte y Seguridad (TSA), que depende de DHS.
Graduada en derecho por la Universidad de Virginia y en servicio exterior por la Universidad de Georgetown, Nielsen creó la década pasada su propia consultoría de gestión de riesgos y trabajó en un centro de estudios sobre seguridad nacional y cibernética; estuvo ligada a esta entre 2012 y 2016.
Fue su cercana relación con Kelly la que elevó a Nielsen a la Casa Blanca, donde se convirtió en jefa adjunta de gabinete y aplicó una marcada rigidez.
La escasa tolerancia de Nielsen por las luchas internas de asesores presidenciales se reflejó en su costumbre de cancelar las reuniones con altos funcionarios de la Casa Blanca si alguien llegaba tarde a reuniones y en su minucioso control de la agenda de Kelly.
La disciplina militar implicó que se ganara entre algunos el mote de “enfermera Ratched”, el autoritario personaje de la novela y película “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”, mientras que, según el diario The New York Times, otros se refieren a ella como Joseph Ratzinger, el cardenal que pasaría a ser el papa Benedicto XVI.

Texto completo: It has been a brutal month for Baltimore's image.
The March 17 cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine featured two row houses in shadows and darkness with the headline: "The Tragedy of Baltimore." The subhead written as if it might be graph showing steady decline said: "How an American City Falls Apart." The story of the surge in violent crime and the toll it has taken on Baltimore's civic life was published online March 12.
On March 13, the Baltimore Sun broke the story of Mayor Catherine Pugh receiving $500,000 for self-published "Healthy Holly" children books from the University of Maryland Medical System where she was serving on the board. Written by Luke Broadwater, the story was followed on an almost daily basis by further Sun reports of self-dealing among UMMS, Pugh and other members of the board.
On March 29, former police commissioner Darryl De Sousa was sentenced to 10 months in prison as a result of failing to file income tax returns for three years and inflating deductions when he did file. De Sousa had been picked to be Baltimore's top cop by Pugh, who initially stood with him and minimized his crimes when federal prosecutors first announced charges against him. The sentencing judge called it "a sad day for our city."
Gov. Larry Hogan has since called for a criminal investigation in connection with the UMMS scandal, and Pugh has gone on indefinite leave amid further Sun revelations this week that her Healthy Holly LLC also received another $300,000 from Associated Black Charities, Kaiser Permanente and Columbia businessman J.P. Grant. Some of that money from Kaiser was paid while the health insurer was negotiating a $48 million contract to cover Baltimore City workers.
And amid all this, what did a prominent city booster say we need to turn things around? A show like "Sex and the City" set in Baltimore.
As I watched cable TV coverage of Baltimore burning with 114 fires on the night of Freddie Gray's funeral four years ago this month, the only comfort I could find was in the thought that the city I loved could not possibly ever look worse to the world than it did at that profoundly sad moment.
But events this past month proved me wrong. Here I am this week at the keyboard and on CNN writing and talking about the image of Baltimore.
I was hardly the only one talking about it this week in the wake of The Sun's latest Pugh revelations.
On Hearst-owned WBAL Radio Monday, host Brett Hollander told his listeners: "For the reputation of this town and where we are now, it's ugly. It is ugly. ... This is such a humiliating moment in time."
On Morgan State University's public radio station WEAA, Karsonya (Kaye) Wise Whitehead, host of "Today with Dr. Kaye," was just as passionate and angry on her afternoon show Tuesday.
After questioning the mayor's deals with Associated Black Charities and Kaiser Permanente and then listening to a caller lament the lack of public outrage about corrupt politicians, Whitehead urged those in her audience who might not appreciate the urgency of the moment to "wake up" because "the future of our city is at stake right now."
And then, she really let it rip.
"Every time Baltimore City ends up in the public light, we are a spectacle, we are a joke," she said. "It is a travesty. Whether it was last year with our babies not having heat in their schools, that was a national story. That was an embarrassment. Whether it's this Gun Trace Task force, corrupt police officers. A national story, embarrassing. Whether it's the ways we're dealing with De Sousa. A national story, embarrassing. And here we are with the mayor."
She urged her listeners to get involved in the political life of the city and speak out: "Now is not the time to be quiet," she said.
"Amen, Dr. Kaye," I thought.
I had no amen's for some of the things I heard Kirby Fowler, president of the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore, say Monday on public radio WYPR's "Midday" show during a discussion about the Times magazine story.
When asked about the story written by Baltimore resident (and Sun alumnus) Alec MacGillis, Fowler said, "Well, first of all, Alec MacGillis, if he wrote an 8,000-word essay or love letter about Baltimore, I don't think the Times would have published it. I know Alec MacGillis. We follow each other on Twitter. He says a lot of nice things about Baltimore. But the New York Times will not post something like that or publish something like that ... "
"Hmmm, that's not the Times I know," I thought.
Host Tom Hall politely challenged Fowler with the mention of a story published by the Times on March 22 that was headlined "Why Baltimore Persists as a Cultural Beacon."
Featuring John Waters, Anne Tyler, Joyce J. Scott and David Simon, it certainly seemed positive to me. But not so much to Fowler.
"But the headline was, 'It persists' in Baltimore," Fowler said, emphasizing the word persists. "'Culture 'persists' in Baltimore. So it's snarky. It comes from first ignorance of Baltimore. And there's some condescension ..."
I did not read the headline or story that way, but Fowler's entitled to his reading of the text.
In answer to a Hall question about how Baltimore can turn its image around, Fowler mentioned local marketing and his wish for a national TV series that would showcase parts of Baltimore that Simon's HBO drama "The Wire" didn't.
"In my opinion, I think New York City turned around more because of 'Seinfeld,' 'Sex and the City' and 'Friends,'" he said. "Especially 'Sex and the City,' because you got to see women walking in and out of department stores, or retail stores, and that changed the impression. So, I think it's important to have a few different versions of what's happening here."
I would argue that fixing serious police problems did far more to turn around New York City than three TV series, which, by the way, were often criticized for their all-white starring casts. A TV show can make your city look as glamorous and exciting as you want. But if people get mugged or shot when they visit, they won't be back.
Furthermore, there are already some different versions of "what's happening here" in Baltimore that have taken root in popular culture. Tyler's working and middle class milieu of families, homes and shops is not Simon's world of drug corners, cop shops and housing projects. And Tyler's audience is hardly niche. The Pulitzer-Prize-winning novelist has sold hundreds of thousands of books, some of which have been made into network movies with stars like James Garner and Joanne Woodward.
There are, however, two images that dominate depictions of Baltimore today: abandoned row houses and night-time crime scenes.
While we often think of such visuals as the primary source of what we call our city's image, such optics actually grow out of narratives. And the narrative that both of those visuals grow out of is the one that says Baltimore is a dysfunctional, dangerous and deeply corrupt city that operates in the interests of various elites even as it fails to protect and often exploits its citizens.
That's what is so destructive about Pugh's "Healthy Holly" deals: They offer proof positive to some of the corruption and dysfunction narrative. They bake that narrative into more and more minds around the world. And this comes courtesy of the mayor who urged us to "change the narrative," the person we chose to lead us after the uprising when almost everyone in the city agreed we no longer had any margin for error if we wanted Baltimore to have a future.
Like WEAA's Whitehead, I also am angry - angry and sad.
This week, I screened a documentary about Baltimore titled "Charm City" that will air on PBS April 22. Working like ethnographers, filmmaker Marilyn Ness and her team burrowed deeply into the culture of the Rose Street community in Baltimore to show residents there, along with some police officers and an elected official, working against tremendous hardships and odds to try to make Baltimore better in the wake of Gray's death.
Visually powerful, this is the Baltimore of "The Wire." In fact, at times, it looks even harsher. (Sorry, no Carrie Bradshaws buying impossibly expensive shoes here.)
There are moments when it seems as if Ness is filming in a Third World country, the living conditions are so challenging and poor. And that's depressing.
But the film is also inspirational in the determination, tenacity, hope, integrity and sense of community among the people on Rose Street who pick up dust pans and brooms every day and try to clean up the poverty, decay and neglect that surrounds them.
There are heroes here in the biggest sense of that word going back to the ancient Greeks. Clayton Guyton, who founded the Rose Street Community Center, is one them. Alex Long, a protege of Guyton's, is another. To me, Long is the hope for the future of our beleaguered city.
It is heartbreaking to see some of the setbacks they suffer and the grit with which they continue to battle for a better city. But it is also infuriating to watch them now with the knowledge of a growing City Hall scandal that mocks their faith in the city and threatens to betray their efforts.
In the film, we see residents of Rose Street coming to Guyton's center early in the morning to get bus money so that they can get to work. In The Sun, meanwhile, we read of Pugh's Healthy Holly LLC collecting $100,000 checks from business and civic elites. Two Baltimores, indeed.
I have said this before, but after decades of studying media and reporting and writing about it, one thing I know to be true is that you cannot brand or market your way out of what WBAL's Hollander called the "humiliating" and "ugly" place Baltimore now holds in the global mind. And no network, cable or streamed series is going to magically appear to change that.
What we need is a real-life reckoning of the righteous to fix the problems in the schools and the corruption in the police department and City Hall. And that needs to be accompanied by a very public naming, shaming and purge of the boardroom and backroom grifters and dealers.
Start there, and be amazed at how Baltimore's image will begin to change for the better.

Texto completo: Valley News Sports Editor
Laura Schuler heard the remarks when she was a young girl in Ontario: Hockey is for boys, not girls. Go find something else to do.
Her love of the game overrode the naysayers. Schuler enjoyed a superb career at Northeastern University with three 20-win seasons, led the Huskies in scoring once, captured gold medals for Canada at three IIHF Women’s World Championships and skated on the country’s first Olympic women’s hockey team in Nagano, Japan, in 1998. She’s in her alma mater’s varsity club hall of fame.
So when the second-year Dartmouth College women’s hockey saw the news of last week in her sport, she chose to view the opportunity rather than the disappointment.
Last Sunday, the Canadian Women’s Hockey League — one of two small women’s pro circuits in North America — announced it would be folding effective May 1 after 12 seasons. The league, which employed a considerable number of current and former American and Canadian Olympic stars, operated six franchises, at least two of which — Les Canadiennes de Montreal and the Toronto Furies — appear to be headed to the surviving association, the five-team, U.S.-based National Women’s Hockey League.
The timing couldn’t have been much worse: The women’s world hockey championships began in Finland on Thursday, giving players at the game’s top level an unwelcome talking point.
“I think my reaction was the same as the players’: I was definitely shocked by it,” Schuler said in a Wednesday phone chat from her Dartmouth office. “Obviously, it was bad to see that they had to fold, because it was a great league. The product they were putting on the ice was absolutely outstanding. The best players in the world are there.”
But she’s a firm believer in the theory that a door opens as another closes.
We find ourselves in an important period in women’s sports. There have been some victories: pro tennis’ attempts to deliver equal winnings to men and women, the successful effort by last year’s U.S. women’s world hockey championship team to get better pay. Some Major League Soccer franchises have taken active interest in the National Women’s Soccer League teams in their cities, providing logistical assistance or scheduling women’s-men’s doubleheaders.
There have been setbacks, too. The WNBA, in my mind, remains the standard bearer for women’s professional sport in this country, at least in terms of visibility, but player salaries lag behind their NBA counterparts — and even some members of the second-tier NBA G League.
Notre Dame women’s basketball coach Muffet McGraw delivered a gender equity rant prior to last week’s NCAA Final Four, and all of her points — the lack of female coaches in her sport, the desire to see more women in leadership roles everywhere — were valid. Yet at the same time, the New York Times reported how USA Hockey has failed to follow through on promises made to the national women’s hockey program in the wake of last year’s job action, the organization doing little to raise the sport’s presence or contribute to its growth in the wake of an Olympic gold-medal run in South Korea.
Schuler — whose Canadians took home silver from Pyeongchang and who no longer coaches the national team — didn’t have a professional league in which to skate when her Northeastern playing days were done, but she has an appreciation for the option being available today. It isn’t part of her pitch to recruits, however; Schuler said international hockey remains to the pinnacle of her sport.
“For a lot of our girls, what’s important is they aren’t necessarily playing the game to go play professionally in the end,” Schuler explained. “They love to play the game, if that makes sense. They’re trying to be better because they love the game.
“When we’re recruiting kids, it’s about trying to sell the fact that if they come to your program, you will help them be the best player and person they can become, so they can succeed beyond four years of college in whatever path that takes. It could either be playing for a professional or national program or moving on and becoming a professional in whatever field of study they are pursuing.”
On Tuesday, according to the Times, the NHL became one of the biggest financial backers of the NWHL. Commissioner Gary Bettman has been quoted as saying he’s not a fan of the economic models of either pro women’s league. That’s fine; at least the NHL is doing something, but I think it can do more.
Seattle will join the NHL as its 32nd member in the next two years. Why not go back to the ownership group and offer an incentive to start an NWHL franchise? The city enthusiastically supports women’s teams such as WNBA’s Storm (average attendance: 8,109) and NWSL’s Reign (3,824). Games need not be held in whatever new arena gets built; find a smaller and more intimate setting, then drop the puck and see what happens.
I suspect it will be something good, just as Schuler thinks women’s hockey will bounce back from its most recent and unexpected setback.
“I grew up playing with people telling me I shouldn’t play hockey, it’s a boys sport, but that never stopped me from playing a game that I absolutely loved to play,” she said. “When I grew up playing there was no national team, no professional teams, but that never took away from my passion for wanting to play that game and trying to get better at it.
“I think that the game itself is something what will continue to inspire young boys and girls to keep playing and evolving and growing. Honestly, I think our game is just going to continue to keep getting better.”

Texto completo: YouTube loves a surprise. So much viral video content is built on just sneaking up on people with an extravagant display of good news: Proposal videos, promposal videos, college acceptance videos, soldier homecoming videos. The genre is so emotionally powerful, it can even become a little bit manipulative -- working to make us believe stuff we don't actually agree with. Get taken by surprise in "Internetting" Episode 10.
Boo!!!,
Amanda

Episode Notes
It's super mean, but I love those "What the Fluff Challenge" videos where people prank their dogs. The Washington Post profiled TM Landry College Prep, the Louisiana high school that films all of its seniors' college acceptance moments, churning out many viral videos. Here is Lisa Silvestri's paper on the feeling of vicarious sacrifice produced by surprise soldier homecoming videos, and her book on social media and war. I previously wrote about the escalating nature of prank YouTube videos for Slate, and the awkward charm of promposal videos for The New York Times.

Texto completo: Since arriving at the University of Illinois, I have experienced the toll that stress can take on students' mental health.
From the beginning, students are pulled in many directions, from excelling academically to building social connections. The stress associated with looming deadlines and uncertainty about the future has large implications.
According to the New York Times, over 60 percent of students reported "overwhelming" anxiety in the last year and 40 percent reported depression that interferes with functioning.
Another article published in Nature reported that graduate students around the world have rates of anxiety and depression six times higher than the general population.
Moreover, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, universities are struggling to keep up with the increased need for mental health services.
As a graduate student with anxiety and depressive symptoms, I am encouraging professors to recognize that students are more than their grades and that academic performance doesn't necessarily indicate future success.
It is critical that professors recognize that mental health matters and should take priority over academic deadlines. Professors can normalize some of the stress associated with graduate work by periodically reminding students it is OK to feel anxious or depressed about high workloads or a poor test score.
Finally, and perhaps most important, professors should know how to help students properly access mental health resources on campus and in the community. By following these suggestions, professors can make graduate education a positive learning experience despite the inherent stress.

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Texto completo: Twenty-five years ago, on April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain died at the age of 27, a victim of suicide. He left behind the epochal rock music he made as the singer and guitarist for Nirvana, piles of journals and artwork, and a final note that didn't clear up the contradictions of his short life. Which was probably how he wanted it: The previous year, he had painted on the wall of his rented Seattle home, in large red block letters, "None of You Will Ever Know My Intentions."
Many Nirvana biographies rehash the basics of Cobain's story or peddle conspiracy theories that he was murdered, but there are also plenty of ways to go deeper. Here's what to read, listen to, watch and explore:
Books
'Journals' (Riverhead)
With nearly 300 pages of photo replicas of Cobain's personal journals and letters (and doodles, sketches and song lists), this 2002 book is funny, painful and shockingly intimate: a guided tour of the singer's own churning psyche. "Its hard to decipher the difference between a sincere entertainer and an honest swindler," Cobain wrote. Here's what The New York Times's Neil Strauss wrote when the book came out.
'Come as You Are' (Three Rivers)
This deeply reported 1993 biography by Michael Azerrad, first published while Cobain was alive, was the original bible for Nirvana fans. Its strongest passages evoke the life of young Cobain in Aberdeen, Wash., a child of divorce who would sometimes spend the weekend killing time at a local logging company where his father worked: "He would get into his dad's van and listen to Queen's 'News of the World' over and over again on the eight-track. Sometimes he'd listen so long that he'd drain the battery and they'd have to find someone to jump-start the engine."
'Heavier Than Heaven' (Hachette)
Charles R. Cross, formerly the editor of the Seattle music paper The Rocket, covered the Nirvana story from early on -- and conducted over 400 interviews for this thorough, definitive 2001 biography. Cobain's widow, the musician Courtney Love, granted Cross extensive interviews and access to Cobain's archives, including arcana such as a visual assignment he completed during his final stay in rehab: "For 'surrender,' he drew a man with a bright light emanating from him. For 'depressed,' he showed an umbrella surrounded by ties." Read The New York Times review.
Articles
'Takeoff: The Oral History of Nirvana's Crossover Moment' (Cuepoint)
When Nirvana's "Nevermind" hit No. 1 soon after its 1991 release, it shocked the band members and their grunge cohort, who had assumed that at best, the group would be underground heroes. Its multiplatinum success also opened the doors for many Nirvana-bes. This oral history by Nick Soulsby tells that story from the viewpoint of Nirvana's college-rock peers, such as Gary Floyd of opening act Sister Double Happiness remembering Nirvana's "road manager telling everyone backstage one night the CD had hit 1 million sales that day. They seemed almost embarrassed."
'The Dark Side of Kurt Cobain' (The Advocate)
Cobain loudly and frequently declared himself as an ally of gay people (and women, and people of color), so it was fitting that he gave one of his best interviews in this 1993 cover story with The Advocate, telling Kevin Allman, "I've always been a really sickly, feminine person anyhow, so I thought I was gay for a while because I didn't find any of the girls in my high school attractive at all."
'Kurt Cobain, The Rolling Stone Interview: Success Doesn't Suck' (Rolling Stone)
In Cobain's last major interview, he informed David Fricke that he had wanted to call Nirvana's "In Utero" album "I Hate Myself and I Want to Die," "but I knew the majority of the people wouldn't understand." He insisted that the suicidal sentiment was only a joke: "I'm a much happier guy than a lot of people think I am."
'Never More' (The Village Voice)
After Cobain's death, Ann Powers filed a raw dispatch from Seattle, reporting how the tragedy affected his friends and the neighbors who had never met him. "The kids I found who did mourn Cobain, hovering behind police lines at the house where he'd died or building shrines from candles and Raisin Bran boxes at the Sunday night vigil organized by three local radio stations, seemed to think of him more as a lost friend than as a candidate for that dreaded assignment, role model."
Live Videos
'Nirvana -- The Moon, New Haven 1991'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
On Sept. 26, 1991, just two days after the release of "Nevermind," Nirvana played a great, sweaty show at a tiny club in New Haven -- and miraculously, it was captured on this remarkably high-quality amateur video. The set featured just a few songs from the unfamiliar "Nevermind," leaning heavily on the band's 1989 debut, "Bleach." Cobain, the bassist Krist Novoselic, and the drummer Dave Grohl all performed with joy and abandon, looking more at home in a filthy black room with a low ceiling than they ever did in arenas.
'Live at Reading'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the summer of 1992, when Nirvana played this storied U.K. festival, the band was divided by arguments over royalties and reports of Cobain's heroin habit. Responding to the mood, Cobain came onstage in a wheelchair, wearing a hospital gown and a blond wig, and began the set with an out-of-tune cover of Bette Midler's "The Rose." At the end of the show, the group systematically destroyed its equipment. In between, almost as an afterthought, it delivered an hour and a half of full-blast rock.
'Drain You'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When Jimmy McDonough, the author of the 2002 book "Shakey: Neil Young's Biography," wanted to show Young a live Nirvana performance after Cobain died, this 1993 clip from an MTV "Live and Loud" concert was the one he chose. "When you see the way he was," an impressed Young said, "there's no way he could ever get through the other end of it. Because there was no control to the burn. That's why it was so intense. He was not holding back at all."
'Nirvana -- Munich, Germany'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Nirvana's last concert, on March 1, 1994, at a cavernous airport terminal that had been converted into a club, was an ordeal for a burned-out Cobain: He wanted to end the band, he wanted to divorce Love, he wanted to score drugs at the Munich train station. But the show (rendered here with just the first 10 minutes of video but a full 80 minutes of audio) was one final scream of pain, ending with "Heart-Shaped Box." "Hey, wait, I got a new complaint," Cobain sang, never meaning it more.
'Kurt Cobain -- Different Vocals'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This video collects live moments when Cobain dramatically altered his usual performances of familiar songs for various punk-rock reasons such as needing to shout over out-of-tune instruments (on "Come as You Are") or just wanting to mess with a TV countdown show that was forcing him to mime playing his guitar (on "Smells Like Teen Spirit").
'MTV Unplugged in New York'
Playing acoustically for 44 minutes, Nirvana paid tribute to influences ranging from David Bowie to the Meat Puppets, and showed the delicate beauty behind its distorted guitars. And with the final song, a cover of Leadbelly's "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," Cobain gave one of his greatest vocal performances; it felt powerful enough to bring the curtain down on all of human existence.
Documentary Footage
'Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck' (Amazon)
Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, served as executive producer on this authorized documentary feature directed by Brett Morgen. Mike Hale wrote in his Times review in 2015, "Mr. Morgen was given access to Cobain's archives -- 'art, music, journals, Super 8 films and audio montages' -- and his exhilarating, exhausting, two-hour-plus film, both an artful mosaic and a hammering barrage, reflects years of rummaging through that trove."
'One of Kurt Cobain's Final Interviews'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In this 26-minute WatchMojo interview from 1993, filmed with the Seattle waterfront as a backdrop, Cobain was bearded and scabby, smoking one cigarette after another. He was also relaxed and thoughtful, laughing at questions about his rock-star status that on a different day would have made him bristle. He explained, "Either I've accepted it or I've gone beyond insane."
Poetry
'8 Fragments for Kurt Cobain'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The poet Jim Carroll, famous for the autobiographical book "The Basketball Diaries" and the autobiographical song "People Who Died," wrote and performed this poem after Cobain's death, trying to make sense of the senseless. It begins, "Genius is not a generous thing/In return it charges more interest than any amount of royalties can cover/And it resents fame/With bitter vengeance."
Fiction
'About a Boy' (Penguin)
The death of Cobain haunts Nick Hornby's second novel, shattering some of its characters and binding some of them together. The 12-year-old Marcus tries to make sense of the news he sees plastered all over the front pages of the evening papers: "He wondered if his mum was O.K., even though he knew there was no connection between his mum and Kurt Cobain because his mum was a real person and Kurt Cobain wasn't; and then he felt confused, because the newspaper headline had turned Kurt Cobain into a real person somehow."
'Skip to the End' (Insight)
This evocative 2018 science-fiction graphic novel by the writer Jeremy Holt and the artist Alex Diotto tells the story of a grunge band called Samsara (clearly inspired by Nirvana) and a guitar that functions as a time-travel device. The metaphor works not only because of the urge Nirvana fans have to create an alternate timeline where Cobain survived, but because recorded music is itself a time-travel device, teleporting people both to the moment when it was made and the moment when it first touched a listener's soul.
'Last Days' (Streaming Services)
The filmmaker Gus Van Sant was a kindred spirit to Cobain: an independent artist from the Pacific Northwest who somehow wandered into the cultural mainstream. So it seemed natural in 2005 when he made a movie about (a thinly fictionalized version of) Cobain, played by Michael Pitt. In her Times review, Manohla Dargis called the movie a "mesmerizing dream" and said "Mr. Van Sant's refusal to root around in Cobain's consciousness, to try to explain why and how he created, suffered and died, is a radical gesture, both in aesthetic and in moral terms."
How The New York Times Covered Nirvana
In 1991, Karen Schoemer was supposed to interview Cobain; he didn't show up, so she wrote about "Nevermind" instead. Novoselic provided a few quotes: "We just want to play," he said, "and put out what we consider good records." A few months later, Simon Reynolds dissected some of the album's songs: "'Smells Like Teen Spirit' could be this generation's version of the Sex Pistols' 1976 single, 'Anarchy in the U.K.,' if it weren't for the bitter irony that pervades its title."
In 1992, Schoemer mused on Nirvana's set on "Saturday Night Live," a performance that she said "showed an astounding lack of musicianship" while later acknowledging that the band had released "quite simply, one of the best alternative rock albums produced by an American band in recent years."
Also in 1992, The Times was fooled by a former Sub Pop receptionist when a reporter called to talk about grunge culture. The resulting glossary of terms she provided -- "harsh realm," "lamestain" and "swingin' on the flippity-flop" -- did enter the pop-culture lexicon, but not the way The Times had planned. The receptionist, Megan Jasper, is now the label's chief executive.
A year later, Jon Pareles interviewed Nirvana on the cusp of releasing "In Utero," as Cobain complained about "Nevermind" sounding too "clean." "Ugh," he said. "I'll never do that again. It already paid off, so why try to duplicate that? And just trying to sell that many records again, there's no point in it." Pareles also reviewed Nirvana at the Roseland Ballroom, the band's first New York show in two years.
When Cobain died, Timothy Egan wrote our obituary and Pareles wrote an appraisal that discussed how "Nirvana was the band that brought punk-rock kicking and screaming into the mass market."
Neil Strauss later wrote about the songs written about Cobain: "Perhaps the most touching song about Cobain was written by a 10-year-old friend of his, Simon Fair Timony. Titled 'I Love You Anyway,' it is performed with the former Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic joining Timony's band, the Stinky Puffs."
In 2004, Thurston Moore wrote a first-person piece about his relationship with Cobain and Nirvana's rise.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: If you can't get out to see Southern California's super bloom before tourists trample it, don't despair: L.A. theater has its own spring fever, with productions celebrating love, youth, discovery and transformation. Here on the 99-Seat Beat, our weekly look at the small-theater scene, we have three picks that could be fun outings for the whole family: "The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane" at the 24th Street Theatre, "The Root Beer Bandits" at the Garry Marshall Theatre and "Evangeline, the Queen of Make-Believe" at Plaza de la Raza.
--
'Edward Tulane' on 24th Street

The essentials: Kate DiCamillo is one of only six writers to have won two Newbery Medals, the most prestigious honor in children's literature. Her 2006 novel, "The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane," in which a self-centered porcelain rabbit learns how to love, may be her best, according to a New York Times review. A porcelain rabbit may not be the most promising leading man. (A snarky review would write itself: "His acting is stiff.") But Dwayne Hartford, playwright-in-residence at Childsplay, a theater for young audiences in Tempe, Ariz., brings Edward to vivid life in his popular stage adaptation.
Why this? The 24th Street Theatre specializes in productions for all ages, and that doesn't mean puppet shows that have parents gritting their teeth or opera that sets toddlers squirming. Director Debbie Devine sets out to create shows that engage everyone.
The details: 24th Street Theatre, 1117 W. 24th St., Los Angeles. 7:30 p.m. Saturdays, 3 p.m. Sundays, through May 19. $24. (213) 745-6516, 24thstreet.org
--
'Root Beer Bandits' at Garry Marshall
The essentials: The late Garry Marshall directed movies, created TV sitcoms, and founded the Falcon Theatre, renamed for him after his death in 2016. Marshall brought together daughter Lori Marshall with Joseph Leo Bwarie and songwriter Rachel Lawrence 15 years ago to create a family musical set during the time of the Pony Express. "The Root Beer Bandits, a Rootin' Tootin' Wild West Musicale," had two wildly successful runs at the Falcon. Now, a new generation will experience the spirited vaudeville-style romp.
Why this? Marshall's crowd-pleasing credo -- which protege Matt Walker once summed up as "Faster! Funnier!" -- doesn't go out of style. The Times praised "Root Beer Bandits" in 2004 for its "effervescent, unsugary book and lyrics." The new production has a stellar cast and the lure of Christine Lakin's choreography.
The details: Garry Marshall Theatre, 4252 W. Riverside Drive, Burbank. 7 p.m. Fridays, 2 and 7 p.m. Saturdays, 1 p.m. Sundays, through April 28. $22. (818) 955-8101, garrymarshalltheatre.org
--
'Evangeline' at Plaza de la Raza
The essentials: The musical "Evangeline, the Queen of Make-Believe" uses the songs of the East L.A. rock band Los Lobos as the soundtrack for a coming-of-age story set in 1968 Hollywood. Co-creators Theresa Chavez and Rose Portillo of About Productions and Louie Perez of Los Lobos have honed "Evangeline" through previous runs into a taut, rocking, psychedelic evocation of an incomparably fertile era, seen through the eyes of a teenage Latina.
Why this? The tagline "Dutiful East L.A. daughter by day, Hollywood go-go dancer by night" is tough to top. If anybody in your party needs more persuading, cue up a Los Lobos album.
The details: Plaza de la Raza's Margo Albert Theatre, 3540 N. Mission Road, Los Angeles. 8 p.m. Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays, through April 14. $15-$35. aboutpd.org

Texto completo: Nearly a year after his death on April 20, 2018, the album that Swedish electronic music producer Avicii had been working on before his untimely passing is finally being released, his family told The New York Times.
Titled "Tim," after his real name, Tim Bergling, the album will come out in June, with its first single “S. O. S. ,” arriving on April 10. The album was 75 to 80 percent finished at the time Avicii’s died is not a bunch of "musical leftovers," the story stressed. It will feature vocals from Chris Martin of Coldplay and Aloe Blacc, the latter of whom sang on Avicii's hit “Wake Me Up. "
Avicii was found dead at the age of 28 during a vacation in Muscat. While declining to go into detail, the Bergling family acknowledged it was a suicide in the Times article.
Last month, his family announced the creation of the Tim Bergling Foundation, which will focus on supporting people and organizations in the field of mental illness and suicide prevention. and will also be active on issues involving climate change, nature conservation and endangered species.
“It’s not even a year since it happened,” Klas Bergling, Avicii's father, told the Times, explaining that while his new music "should be released," his loved ones are still recovering from his death. “The family is very traumatized. We want peace. ”

Texto completo: Please join us for a special event featuring New York Times bestselling author Beverly Lewis at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at the Lester Public Library.
As part of her Midwest promotional tour across Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, Lewis will be in Two Rivers to discuss her latest work, "The Tinderbox," a standalone novel featuring her signature look into Amish family life. She will also meet fans and sign copies of her books.
Born in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, Beverly began writing at the age of 9. Inspired by her mother and grandmother's Plain heritage, she began to write Amish-related novels. With the release of her first adult novel, "The Shunning," in 1997, Lewis pioneered the birth of a genre — Amish fiction. The resulting surges in both reader interest in and publisher output of Amish fiction gained national attention, garnering coverage by Time magazine, the BBC World Service, The Wall Street Journal and Nightline, among others.
Since then, she has written more than 80 books, with more than 17 million copies in print. Her books regularly appear on The New York Times bestsellers list. "The Shunning" was made into an Original Hallmark Channel movie.
Lewis' books focus on the simple life of the Amish. A critic claimed her writing is "a primer on Lancaster County folklore" and said it offers "an insider's view of Amish life." Her latest book, and the focus of the Two Rivers visit, is titled "The Tinderbox." With her parents' 20th anniversary approaching, 18-year-old Sylvia Miller finds her father's cherished brass tinderbox left unlocked. Against her better judgment, Sylvia opens the heirloom, not realizing that what she is about to discover will splinter apart her happy life and alter everything for her close-knit Old Order Amish family. As the long-kept secret emerges into the light of day, can the Millers find a way forward through the turmoil to a place of forgiveness?
Lester Public Library will have copies of "The Tinderbox" and other Lewis titles available for purchase starting a week before the program; a limited number of copies will also be available for sale the day of the talk. All purchases made will support the library's up-coming renovation project. For more about Lewis and her books, visit beverlylewis.com.
We hope you'll join us on Saturday by the library fireplace for what promises to be an entertaining afternoon.
Jeff Dawson is director of Lester Public Library in Two Rivers.

By Eduardo Garcia
Technology moves fast. The coolest gadgets today will be obsolete in a few years and we'll discard them to make room for new ones. Rarely a day goes by that I don't see flat screens, printers and speakers languishing on the sidewalks of New York City.
About half of American states, including New York, have e-waste recycling laws, and around 20 states ban certain types of electronics from landfills. These laws were adopted because many gadgets contain toxic metals -- like lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium -- that can leak into groundwater and soil, poisoning the ecosystem.
The good news is that there are many environmentally friendly options for parting ways with your electronic devices.
First, you could consider trying to give those devices a second life. That applies especially to laptops, tablets and cellphones, which we often discard simply because we want to upgrade.
You could try selling them online, giving them to people you know, or to a charity or nonprofit group like Computers With Causes or the World Computer Exchange. (Experts recommend that you wipe hard drives and memory cards clean before giving the devices away.)
If the gadgets are broken or too old, you can take them to a certified recycling center where technicians may try to refurbish them for reuse in the United States or abroad.
Troy Hanna, a reuse technician at the Lower East Side Ecology Center in New York -- a warehouse full of printers, stereos, desktop computers, screens and TV sets -- said his goal in life was to put "landfills out of business."
"When I refurbish an old computer and somebody buys it, then I do my job twice," he said. "First for the environment, and second for that person who can now use a device that would have ended up in the landfill."
The Lower East Side Ecology Center has a wide selection of laptops, flat-screen TVs, record players and speakers for sale. It also rents vintage devices for use as props on movie sets.
Many people take their used electronics to retailers like Best Buy and Staples, which then send them to recyclers, although they may charge a small fee to handle large items like TV screens.
Electronic devices often contain valuable metals like copper, silver, gold and lithium, too. Their components and circuit boards can be sent to smelters to reclaim those metals, a process that some recyclers call "urban mining." Using recycled metals is less taxing to the environment than extracting, processing and transporting raw materials.
"The plastics, the metals, the glass; the vast majority of the content can get recycled," said Jason Linnell, executive director of the National Center for Electronics Recycling. "There is very little that needs to go into landfills."

Climbing 28 stories, straight up, to get the story
By John Schwartz
If you read my piece last week about Americans who grew up with ties to fossil fuels but found careers in renewable energy, you encountered people from across the country. Besides meeting so many fascinating people and working with a terrific photographer, Brandon Thibodeaux, I got to do something amazing for that story: I climbed a wind tower.
I wrote about the experience for Times Insider, but let me just tell you the main point here: Tiring and scary! The tower is about 300 feet, or about 28 stories, tall. Before I'd gotten halfway up, my forearms were burning and my legs were shaking. I was, in short, a mess. I'd rest on each of the tower's four platforms, then keep going.
Why do it? There's my natural inclination to want to, or, as I like to put it: To ride the rides.
Beyond that, experiences like this one help me tell my stories. Jake Thompson, whom I met in Stanton, Tex., told me that he was afraid of heights but looked into jobs in wind energy at his father's suggestion.
"I looked out at the top," he said of his first climb on a tower, "and decided that was going to be my career." I wanted get a feel for what he'd done so that I could best convey it to readers.
The story had wonderful reporting moments, like sitting around a dining room table in Clawson, Utah, with three generations of the Riley family. That included Chris Riley, who grew up in state's coal country and helped found a company that, by connecting western towns to renewable sources of energy, may hasten coal's decline. He laid out for his family, for the first time, the full implications of his business model.
Their reaction was sober and supportive. It was a privilege to be with them.
And you know how they say "getting there is half the fun?" Well, no. It was two-hour drive from Salt Lake City to Clawson, with white-knuckle steering through mountain passes in a snowstorm. And after the interview, I had to take the same roads back.
It was totally worth it.
We occasionally hear criticism from readers who say that, as climate reporters, we should be reducing our own carbon footprint by avoiding air travel. I get that point. But to me, if you're going to tell the story in a rich way, with the kind of detail that puts readers right there, you have to go there. And you should climb the ladder.

Top House Democrat dismisses Mark Zuckerberg's 'advice' about regulating Facebook

Texto completo: A top House Democrat on Thursday scoffed at the possibility of Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg playing a role in developing the regulations that could potentially govern his social media giant.

"From my perspective, I think it's a little rich to have Mark Zuckerberg try to give us advice about how Facebook ought to be regulated," Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said during a Washington Post event in Washington, D.C. "The reality is Facebook has demonstrated unequivocally that it is not capable of regulating itself. It has been a bad actor in some very fundamental ways."

"While I appreciate that Mr. Zuckerberg is sort of aware of the growing sentiment across the country that Facebook needs to be held accountable and needs to be regulated in a way that protects data privacy, that empowers people to actually have control over their own data, that prevents that platform from being used to kind of promote false information, and interfere with our democratic institutions," the chairman of House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Antitrust Law said. "It's good he acknowledges that sentiment out there, but I do not expect that we’re going to rely on Mr. Zuckerberg to put together the proposals to regulate himself."

Last week Zuckerberg wrote a Washington Post opinion piece that argued for a regulatory framework to provide guidance regarding harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data portability.

But the entrepreneur told ABC News on Thursday that while Facebook had taken action, particularly in relation to political ads after the 2016 election, "the definition of a political ad" is still cause for concern.

"It's not clear to me that we want a private company to be making that kind of a fundamental decision about what is political speech and how should that be regulated?" Zuckerberg said.

Last week Cicilline implored the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook has broken antitrust laws.

"American antitrust agencies have not pursued a significant monopoly case in more than two decades, even as corporate concentration and monopoly power have reached historic levels," the Rhode Island Democrat wrote in a New York Times op-ed in March. "It’s clear that serious enforcement is long overdue."

Texto completo: Algunos de los investigadores del fiscal especoal Robert Mueller han advertido que los hallazgos de su investigación son mucho más perjudiciales para el presidente Donald Trump de lo que se ha dado a conocer.
Hasta el momento, el fiscal general William Barr sólo ha dado a conocer un resumen de tres páginas y media donde señala que no indagará al mandatario sobre posible “obstrucción de la justicia”, dado que el reporte de Mueller no halló pruebas concluyentes al respecto, aunque no lo exonera.
El New York Times cita a funcionarios del gobierno y otros personajes familiarizados con el caso, quienes creen que Barr debería haber incluido más del reporte integral sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
A pesar de la alerta, no hay detalles sobre qué información sería “más perjudicial” para el presidente Trump.
El procurador general se comprometió a publicar el informe de casi 400 páginas a mediados de abril, con ciertas partes bloqueadas, como la protección de la información secreta del gran jurado y las fuentes y métodos de recopilación de información.
El presidente Trump reaccionó a la revelación del Times al afirmar que el periódico no tiene “fuentes legítimas”, incluso consideró que quizá el diario “¡no tenga realmente fuentes!” , acusando que su reportaje es “falso”.
The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!

Texto completo: Can you stop migration by stopping aid?
That’s a central question following President Donald Trump’s announcement last week that he would cut $450 million in aid to Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras – the home countries of tens of thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers arriving at the U.S. southern border.
It’s a dramatic move meant to hold governments responsible for the growing tally of families, unaccompanied minors, and others leaving the Northern Triangle, as this part of Central America is known. Central American governments should pull their weight in slowing the outflow of citizens, the White House announcement suggests – and if not, why “reward” them with aid? “They haven’t done a thing for us,” Mr. Trump said Friday. 
Development assistance is hardly a perfect system, analysts say. But the cuts are expected to mostly affect nongovernmental organizations, charities, and churches addressing some of the root causes of migration – not the governments themselves. That raises the question of whether reducing assistance successfully can pressure governments to halt migration, or lead to more.
The U.S. system is at a “breaking point,” as migrants and asylum-seekers arrive in large groups at the southern border, the head of Customs and Border Protection said last month. Between October and February, 136,150 people traveling in families were arrested by U.S. border agents. That exceeds the total for the entire fiscal year that ended in September 2018, which was 107,212. Many believe Central Americans see Trump’s “zero tolerance” migration policies as a “now or never” moment to ask for asylum in the United States before the doors are shut entirely. 
“It’s a bit Orwellian to ask governments to stop people from leaving,” says Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. “With the ‘stick,’ it’s hard to see what exactly the Central American governments can do that would be legal that would help them turn around the number of people exiting their countries.”
“We can work with governments to change conditions on the ground,” he adds, “but that requires development aid” – and time.
It’s a lesson learned, in part, right at the southern border. For decades, the bulk of migrants attempting to cross into the U.S. there were Mexican. But starting in the late aughts, the number of Mexicans crossing without documentation fell dramatically, reaching a point of “net-zero” migration in 2012.
A number of factors played a role, from the end of Mexico’s single-party rule in 2000, to both countries’ shifting economies. But the U.S. did contribute to the decrease by incentivizing Mexico’s economic development, observers say. The North American Free Trade Agreement, implemented in 1994, was sold by consecutive U.S. administrations as a program to halt Mexican migration by way of creating more formal employment at home and plugging Mexico into the global economy.
But NAFTA was a piece “of the larger puzzle of Mexico’s development,” says Mr. Selee. “What Bush and Clinton didn’t mention was that it was going to take almost 15 years” for the agreement to create the kinds of opportunities that “give migrants hope to remain at home.” 
Subbing in for the state Congress has given overwhelming bipartisan support to development aid in the Northern Triangle over the past several years, and is expected to contest Trump’s cuts.
The biggest portion of aid in the region has gone toward violence prevention and improving security and justice systems, according to the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a human rights organization that has tracked U.S. aid since 2016.
The packages contain almost no direct aid to governments, according to Adriana Beltrán, director of citizen security at WOLA. The closest they come to government hands is in security assistance for police forces, for example, or helping a finance ministry improve its budget management system.
“Since 2016, you’ve had bipartisan consensus that you need to address the factors that are driving irregular migration from the region,” says Ms. Beltrán. “This decision [to cut aid] is going to undermine all those efforts and worsen the situation.” She says she’s never seen development aid used to punish or pressure regional governments.
The Northern Triangle is plagued with violence, insecurity, and poverty. A 2015 investigation by Honduras’s La Prensa newspaper found that Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Guatemalans pay roughly $390 million, $200 million, and $61 million, respectively, in yearly “fees” to organized crime groups in order to do anything from walk to school, take a certain bus route, or operate a small business. All three countries regularly rank as some of the most dangerous in the world not at war.
The kinds of civil society-run programs funded by U.S. development aid essentially do the work of the Northern Triangle’s weak public institutions, says Ursula Roldán, director of a migration research institute at Rafael Landívar University in Guatemala City.
“We’ve seen a complete deterioration of government institutions,” Dr. Roldan says, and that directly affects citizens. “Take agriculture. If you lose one harvest, you essentially have to leave. There’s no government support.”
But she still hasn’t seen aid packages deliver the dramatic changes that would offer more Guatemalans opportunities to remain at home.
“American aid to Central America has a lot of problems,” write regional experts and Haverford College professors Anita Isaacs and Anne Preston in a New York Times opinion piece this week. “Its total amounts are paltry, and it is mostly distributed inefficiently in large blocks by foreign contractors.” But it has shown results in places like El Salvador, they note, where violence-prevention programming has been credited with helping lower the homicide rate. Salvadoran migration to the U.S. more than halved between 2016 and 2018, according to U.S. statistics on border apprehensions.
“The moment to get tough is not because people are leaving, but because democracy [in the region] is backsliding,” says Mr. Selee, citing the Guatemalan and Honduran governments’ pushback against corruption-monitoring commissions. The Guatemalan government has repeatedly attempted, most recently in January, to remove CICIG, an internationally-backed body investigating top-level politicians, business people, and security officials.
“It was a missed opportunity [to intervene] and now we’re dealing with the symptoms,” he says.

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a two-minute video released Wednesday, defended past behavior of close contact with women that has come under recent scrutiny, but also said he's able to change.
The response from Biden, who is laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run, came a day after two more women shared stories of encounters with him that they alleged were inappropriate. Their comments followed similar complaints from two other women.
"I want to talk about gestures of support that I've made to women and some men that have made them uncomfortable," Biden said, seated on a couch and speaking directly to the camera. "I've always tried to make a human connection that's my responsibility, I think ... it's the way I've always been, it's the way I try to show I care about them and listening."
Biden continued, saying he is going to be "mindful" of people's boundaries going forward.
"The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. I get it, I get it, I hear what they're saying and I understand it," he said. "I'll be much more mindful, that's my responsibility, and I'll meet it."
Biden stopped short of apologizing for his past behavior, instead circling back to his previous defense that politics is about human connection.
Questions about Biden's behavior with women have flared since last Friday when Lucy Flores, a politician in Nevada, shared her first-person account of an alleged incident with Biden at a campaign event when she claims he kissed the back of her head.
Since then, Amy Lappos alleged Biden rubbed noses with her at a fundraiser, and on Tuesday The New York Times published stories of two more women who allege Biden touched them in ways that they say were not appropriate.
Biden's propensity for being affectionate, once brushed off as "Biden being Biden" is now being viewed through a #MeToo lens, and it could prove problematic for his expected presidential run.
But Biden's defenders point to his work sponsoring the Violence Against Women Act and combating sexual assault on campus as examples of how he's led on these issues throughout his career.

Age issue bigger challenge for Joe Biden than Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: They sit on top of Democratic presidential primary polls, but as Nate Silver notes, those numbers may not yet reflect the age issue that will be an obstacle for both Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Though both men will likely have to confront the issue at some point, it will likely be a bigger challenge for Biden to overcome.

At the outset, it's worth making clear that age should be considered a legitimate issue for both candidates. If elected, Biden would be 78 on Inauguration Day, and Sanders would be 79. By way of comparison, Ronald Reagan, the oldest president ever to serve, was still weeks away from reaching 78 when he left office. When Reagan made the famous quip in a 1984 debate about opponent Walter Mondale's "youth and inexperience," he was still only 73.

That said, there are two ways in which age can manifest themselves in a campaign. The most direct would be some sort of health scare, or an unfortunate fall, like Bob Dole's in 1996. But if older candidates can avoid such news, and otherwise seem energetic and vigorous, it's possible they could get past a more direct public reckoning with their ages.

The more indirect way that older candidates can be hurt is if their age can become representative of having old and outdated ideas. This makes older candidates particularly vulnerable to younger rivals promising change. It's in this more indirect way that Biden will have the bigger challenge.

Biden has been in the political arena since the 1970s, and during that time he was a traditional mainstream liberal who often tried to position himself as a centrist on some issues. In a drastically changed Democratic Party, his past has come under fire from liberals, and he's been forced to apologize multiple times for his previous positions or behavior.

In contrast, Sanders has for decades been one of the most liberal members of Congress, and the party has moved closer to him.

Just take the issues highlighted in a recent column from Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times, arguing it was the "wrong time" for Biden.

"Beyond gender, on issue after issue, if Biden runs for president he will have to run away from his own record. He — and by extension, we — will have to relive the debate over the Iraq war, which he voted to authorize. He’ll have to explain his vote to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, which, by lifting regulations on banking, helped create the conditions for the 2008 financial meltdown. (Biden has called that vote one of the biggest regrets of his career.) In 2016, Hillary Clinton was slammed for her previous support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which contributed to mass incarceration. Biden helped write the law, which he called, in 2015, the '1994 Biden crime bill.'"

Yet on those issues, Sanders' record is much more closely aligned with prevailing liberal preferences. Sanders voted against the Iraq War and against repealing Glass-Steagall Act. And while he did vote for the 1994 crime bill, as Vox's German Lopez has written, Sanders was equivocal even at the time, and in other instances in the 1990s spoke out against mass incarnation before it became as major of an issue within the party. On other issues such as free college, socialized health insurance, and income inequality, Sanders was ahead of much of his party.

So, while a younger rival could challenge Biden for representing old ideas, it's much harder to throw that argument at Sanders, who could legitimately counter that he was fighting the party's establishment on behalf of a radical liberal agenda well before it was popular.

This isn't to say that age won't become an issue for Sanders, or that he won't face other serious challenges (such as his difficulty appealing to minority voters). It's just that in the modern Democratic Party, unlike Sanders, Biden's age becomes intertwined with the perception that his ideas and attitudes are from a different era.

Elon Musk’s compensation at least 40,000 times more than median Tesla worker

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Resumen: Two months after a person was found shot to death in a St. Johns County condominium, investigators say they are waiting on analysis of evidence sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement before they make a determination as to the nature of the shooting. The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office asked Putnam County to step in after learning that Washtock, who is said to have identified as both male and female, had been looking into a case that has long hung over the local agency. Rose was talking about the investigation into the death of Michelle O'Connell, a 24-year-old woman who died in September 2010 of a gunshot through her mouth while in the home of her boyfriend, Jeremy Banks, a St. Johns County sheriff's deputy.

Texto completo: Two months after a person was found shot to death in a St. Johns County condominium, investigators say they are waiting on analysis of evidence sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement before they make a determination as to the nature of the shooting.

"We've got items over mostly for DNA," Putnam County Sheriff's Office Col. Joseph Wells told The Record on Monday.

Investigators from his agency began collecting that evidence after taking over the case from the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office on Jan. 31.

It was that morning that authorities found 38-year-old Ellie Marie Washtock shot to death in a third-floor unit at Laterra Condominiums after Washtock's 15-year-old son reported finding the body.

The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office asked Putnam County to step in after learning that Washtock, who is said to have identified as both male and female, had been looking into a case that has long hung over the local agency.

"He is a person who is just a private citizen who tried to take up an investigation on his own behalf on the O'Connell case, which does have ties to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office. ... He was doing an independent investigation," Putnam County Sheriff's Office Maj. Steve Rose told reporters the day of the discovery, before Washtock's identity had been released.

Rose was talking about the investigation into the death of Michelle O'Connell, a 24-year-old woman who died in September 2010 of a gunshot through her mouth while in the home of her boyfriend, Jeremy Banks, a St. Johns County sheriff's deputy.

The gun that killed O'Connell was Banks' service weapon, and her family has said that she wouldn't have harmed herself. Banks, who placed the 911 call the night she died saying that she shot herself, maintains his innocence and is still a deputy with the Sheriff's Office.

The case, which has since been reviewed by multiple medical examiners, remains classified as a suicide, and at least two special prosecutors have looked at it and declined to pursue criminal charges.

O'Connell's death has also been the subject of two lengthy articles from The New York Times and a PBS Frontline documentary.

Wells said Monday that detectives with his agency are still working the investigation into Washtock's death, but he doesn't expect any announcements or significant advancement until after the lab results come back from FDLE.

Though an autopsy has been performed and the medical examiner's office confirmed that Washtock died of a gunshot, authorities have not said if the shooting was intentional or a homicide or suicide.

"I don't expect that to happen either until the forensic analysis is completed," Wells said.

He said FDLE has agreed to expedite the processing of the evidence and has allowed investigators to submit more evidence than usual for processing, but no timeline has been provided as to when the work might be done.

"They have agreed to process this just as quickly as they can," he said.

GateHouse Florida reporter Dan Scanlan contributed to this report.

Texto completo: After a 26-year absence, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin returns to Pittsburgh for the Ten Evenings series of literary talks presented by Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures.
Nine other authors will speak here for the first time. The series begins in the fall and ends in April 2020. Here is the lineup:
Novelist Sigrid Nunez speaks Sept. 23. Her most recent novel, "The Friend," received the 2018 National Book Award for fiction. This fall, Ms. Nunez will be writer in residence at Boston University.
Ibram X. Kendi, who speaks Oct. 14, is a professor of history at American University. His book "Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America" received the 2016 National Book Award for nonfiction. His newest book is "How to Be an Antiracist."
Ms. Goodwin will speak Oct. 28 on her latest book, "Leadership in Turbulent Times," which examines the capabilities of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, for whom she was a speechwriter. Her book "No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II" received the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 1995.
Madeline Miller, a dramaturge and classics scholar, speaks Nov. 11. Her novel "Circe" is a feminist retelling of "The Odyssey" from the perspective of a sorceress from Greek mythology. Ms. Miller wrote her debut novel, "The Song of Achilles," while teaching Latin and Greek.
Reza Aslan speaks on Nov. 25. The Iranian-American writer is the author of three books, including his latest, "God: A Human History."
Richard Powers, who speaks Dec. 9, wrote "The Overstory," a fable about environmental activism that ranges from antebellum New York to recent timber wars in the Pacific Northwest. His novel "The Echo Maker" received the 2006 National Book Award for fiction.
Carmen Maria Machado speaks Jan. 20. The author's genre-bending short story collection, "Her Body and Other Parties," was a finalist for the National Book Award. Her memoir "In the Dream House" reveals the history and reality of abuse in relationships.

Texto completo: With all of the controversial things out there in the world, it comes as an odd but welcome relief to find people arguing over something as innocuous as brunch, of all things.
Everyone from the late Anthony Bourdain to Bon Appetit's Andrew Knowlton have caviled. It's a dumping ground for chefs' leftover ingredients and it's riddled with faux hollandaise, they've said. Harsher still is David Shaftel in his New York Times piece titled “Brunch is for jerks," where he argues that the whole ritual is nothing but an excuse for public juvenile behavior, not to mention evidence of callous gentrification.
Lay off and lighten up, brunch's defenders say. Brunch isn't hurting anybody. It's just plain fun. And the dishes it encompasses are scrumptious. And when else do you see sweet and savory on the table simultaneously?
So here's a solution to all of the above: Just get your hands on some terrific brunch recipes created by a few of our best local chefs, and do the honors at home. No regrettable public antics or subpar ingredients required. And to that end, I tested the following dishes in my kitchen (and have included some notes) to make sure they're home-kitchen friendly — and of course, utterly delicious. Which means, mercifully, that brunch is one debate we can all win.

Dead horses stoke fears and reforms in racing

Texto completo: Horse racing is running scared. Fearful of the fallout from a spate of equine fatalities, industry leaders are lobbying for reform with growing urgency and increasing anxiety.
"In horse racing, we say we have a public perception problem," Claiborne Farm president Walker Hancock said Monday. "But we kind of bring some changes to the table and it's 'You can't do that.' I'm worried if we keep going down this road, how far do we have to go before significant changes are made?
"... If we're not going to change now, I don't know what it has to take."
Though the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database shows North American racing suffered more than 6,000 fatal injuries during the last decade, the recent carnage at Santa Anita has created a crisis atmosphere within the sport. When Arms Runner, a 5-year-old gelding, was euthanized Sunday following the San Simeon Stakes, it was the 23rd fatality at the California track since Dec. 26.
Friday, Hancock warned his Twitter followers that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has more members in California than the 600,000 signatures required to place a referendum on the ballot to eliminate horse racing in the state.
Later that day, Stronach Group chief operating officer Tim Ritvo told reporters at Santa Anita that the racing industry needed to be attentive to the concerns of outsiders because, "They're the ones that will come out and vote to end our sport. I think there's more of them than we have customers, unfortunately.
"... The people who do want to end us will come out and vote in droves and the ones that don't care just won't show up at the ballot box."
These concerns could be premature — PETA vice president Kathy Guillermo said Monday her organization has no plans to pursue a ballot measure — but animal rights activists surely sense the same opportunity to press for change as do reformers within the industry.
"Right now we're focused on improvements," Guillermo said. "We're focused on actions that can be done right away.
"... I've been saying the same thing for 10 years that PETA will never support racing, but we want racing to get rid of the drugs, get rid of the whipping, fix the surfaces and take care of the horses both during and after their racing careers."
Racing officials tend to resist the pleas of outside reformers, but numerous industry groups are closely aligned with PETA on doping. Last month, a Horseracing Integrity Act was introduced in Congress with broad support from opponents of race-day medication. Monday, the Jockey Club issued a statement reiterating its advocacy for tighter regulation of performance-enhancing drugs and masking agents that are banned in most countries.
"When you look at fatality rates in the U.S. as compared to other racing jurisdictions, we have a much greater rate of fatality per 1,000 starts than they see overseas," Jockey Club executive director Matt Iuliano said in a telephone interview. "We have to move this sport to a new regulatory paradigm. It's got to include stricter regulations and uniformity."
A broad coalition of breeders, trainers and racing executives have been pushing that agenda for years, but its progress to date has been glacial. Amanda Elliott, chairman of Australia's Victoria Racing Club, ended her first visit to Kentucky last May "absolutely amazed" at resistance to a ban on race-day medications.
"There is no world-class sport anywhere that allows doping or performance enhancing drugs — it is absolutely fundamental," Elliott said, according to the Paulick Report. "What is the U.S. missing that the rest of the world has fully understood for quite some time?"
Gina Rarick, a trainer based in France, pulled back the curtain in an op-ed piece published last week by the New York Times.
"Breeders need to get the highest price possible for a yearling, so in addition to corrective surgery to fix defective legs, they use steroids to add bulk and sheen, and bisphosphonates to stabilize the bone structure," Rarick wrote. "But these bisphosphonates also limit new bone growth, impairing the young horse's ability to adapt to the stresses of training and racing.
"Once the horse has fetched that high price, there is huge pressure on American trainers to get it racing as soon as possible to cover the costs of the purchase and training fees. That means the young racehorse is treated with endless rounds of so-called therapeutic medications: phenylbutazone, known as bute, to help with the aches and pain; clenbuterol to keep the lungs clear (plus there's that added steroidlike side effect, which keeps them eating and keeps the weight on); and the diuretic Lasix every time before fast workouts and races, ostensibly to prevent bleeding in the lungs. There is little science that says Lasix actually does that job, but quite a lot of science identifying Lasix as a performance-enhancing drug."
When Belinda Stronach announced an immediate ban on Lasix at Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields last month, opposition from trainers and owners led her to agree to a more gradual implementation. The policy now applies to all horses born in or after 2018.
Walker Hancock's fear is that the pace of reform may not be fast enough to "get PETA off our back."
"I don't know how serious PETA is about eliminating horse racing," he said, "but in California it's an easy (ballot) measure that could be a real threat. We can turn our backs and say, 'Screw PETA,' but they have the power to screw us over."

On Entering a New Universe

Autor: Popper, Nathaniel. 

Información de publicación: Forward ; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]. 01 Apr 2019: 60.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/on-entering-new-universe/docview/2221151615/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: The only other newspapers that had offered me interviews were local publications that published on tissue-thin paper and covered the ephemeral goings-on of town councils and police precincts. The paper stock the Forward used at the time was somehow much thicker, and it became connected in my head with the sense of historical and intellectual weight in the paper's articles and features. After I joined, the little universe of editors and reporters came to define my Jewish identity and made me feel connected to a history of debate and argument and difficult choices being hashed out in real time.

Texto completo: I hadn't managed to get my hands on a physical copy of the Forward before I showed up for my job interview at the paper back in 2003.
I'd spent the previous year living in Berlin, where copies of Jewish newspapers were few and far between. That was after a childhood in which I had never spent any significant time at Jewish institutions, other than teen night at my Jewish community center.
When I got to New York for my interview, I had combed the subway newsstands, futilely hoping to find a print copy of the paper so that I would have a better sense of what it was all about, beyond the few stories that were posted online.
Luckily, when I showed up for the interview, the editor at the time, J.J. Goldberg, had little interest in talking about what I thought of the latest edition, or how the paper should be covering the news differently. He wanted to have a long conversation about the politics and past of Joschka Fischer, the dashing German foreign minister and erstwhile young radical.
When I walked out of our conversation, which went on past the hour J.J. had allotted for it, I picked up a stack of the most recent editions of the Forward. And when I got back to the apartment where I was staying, I flipped through the broad pages with a sense of discovery and opportunity that I can still feel in my fingers.
The only other newspapers that had offered me interviews were local publications that published on tissue-thin paper and covered the ephemeral goings-on of town councils and police precincts.
The paper stock the Forward used at the time was somehow much thicker, and it became connected in my head with the sense of historical and intellectual weight in the paper's articles and features.
This was not long after Art Spiegel-man had published his graphic series about the twin towers and the war in Iraq, which had been rejected at larger publications. Those comic strips came with a heft that spilled into the pages around them. It was not unlike that job interview with J.J., where we moved so quickly from the latest news to world events and history and big ideas.
When I arrived to start work, I was obsessed with the print copy. There was, of course, the ego involved with where my stories appeared. But even when I didn't have a story, there was something satisfying and almost surprising about the moment when the first stack of papers of the newest edition arrived at the office. It served as evidence that this whole institution, which often seemed like some kind of a mystical Isaac Bashevis Singer fever dream, actually existed.
Before working at the Forward, I had not been much of a Jew to speak of. After I joined, the little universe of editors and reporters came to define my Jewish identity and made me feel connected to a history of debate and argument and difficult choices being hashed out in real time. At a time when the news industry came to seem flimsier by the week, here was a place willing to pay me and other young people to spend weeks reporting and digging deeply into questions that other people didn't want to ask.
Over the years, the paper stock was thinned out and the website became the place for the breaking news stories that mattered. By the time I left, in 2009, the print edition didn't even contain the latest version of my stories when it came out. But there was a degree to which the whole thing should have never existed. I still have some of those papers I took home from my job interview, tucked in a container beneath my bed, proof that it all really happened and that I was a part of it.

Burger King’s Whopper gets an Impossible version

Texto completo: Burger King has begun testing an Impossible Whopper in 59 St. Louis restaurants with an eye to rolling out the plant-based protein option to all of its U.S. locations.
If Burger King’s partnership with Impossible Foods expands, it would be a coup for the Bay Area company that’s dedicated to “making meat using plants.” Burger King is in the top 10 largest fast food chains, frequently listed at No. 6.
Impossible Foods has captured diners’ attention with its signature product, the Impossible Burger, which it markets as being as tasty as beef and requiring far less land, water and other natural resources to produce.
It’s aimed at flexitarians, people who like meat but want to cut down on their consumption for ethical or health reasons.
Impossible Foods also markets itself as a tech company and created a stir last January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with the debut of its Impossible Burger 2.0.
Among the improvements to the product was making it hold together better on grills, thus making it easier for restaurants that flame-broil burgers to serve it.
Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods’ main competitor, announced a partnership with Carl’s Jr. for its Famous Star, placing its Beyond Burger in 3,800 restaurants. Del Taco is moving forward with Beyond Tacos.
Plant-based meats typically cost more than beef, about $2 more at Carl’s Jr. Burger King did not announce the price of its Impossible Whopper in St. Louis but released a video of Whopper lovers proclaiming that they can’t tell the difference.
Burger King is considering a rapid rollout of the Impossible Whopper to 7,200 U.S. restaurants, according to the New York Times. Company representatives affirmed it’s a possibility.
Burger King announced the Impossible Whopper on April Fool’s Day, but in a news release said the Whopper is real and the news is not a whopper.
The Impossible Burger is currently available in more than 5,000 U.S. restaurants, according to the news release. That’s a lot of growth since April 2018, when the Impossible Burger was something of a novelty at events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
Most national chains that serve the Impossible Burger are casual restaurants rather than fast food chains. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews added it to its menu on April 1 as an option for any of its burgers. With more than 570 restaurants in the United States and Canada, it claims to be the largest chain currently serving it.

Texto completo: 1) "America's Got Talent," 8-10 p.m. Tuesday and 8-9 p.m. Wednesday, NBC. The show that dominates the summer Nielsen ratings now moves to live shows, adding a second night. Each Tuesday, we'll see 12 acts and vote; each Wednesday, we'll learn which seven advances. The 36-act line-up includes lots of singers, dancers, and magicians, plus duos that do music, trapeze and ballroom-dancing. But there's also a cat act, a "danger act," a "diablo artist" and, of course, a singing and dancing accordionist.
2) "The Great British Bake Off" finale, 9 p.m. Friday, PBS. This gentle show — a dozen home cooks, in a tent in the British countryside — has been a quiet favorite of some Americans. Now it's moving to a British commercial channel and ending its PBS run. Tonight's finale (taped in 2012) has Brendan Lynch, 63; John Whaite, 23 and James Morton, 21. That's the only all-male finish in the show's eight years. Counting this season, six women and two men have won; other finalist spots were eight apiece.
3) "24 Hours to Hell and Back" season-finale, 9 p.m. Wednesday, Fox. It's a week for food shows to wrap up. In this one, Gordon Ramsay gives restaurants instant makeovers; it departs so Ramsay's other summer show ("MasterChef") can expand. The finale is at Sandra Dee's Bar-B-Que & Seafood, a laidback place in Sacramento. (No, it's not the movie-star Sandra Dee; she died in 2005, at 62.) Using hidden cameras, Ramsay decides the owner lacks discipline with family members who work there.
4) "Elementary," 10 p.m. today, CBS. It's the second new episode in two days for this smart series. (Don't worry, there are plenty left; CBS ordered 21 and didn't start them until April 30.) Tonight — on a Monday that's clogged with reality competitions — Holmes and Watson probe the murder of a robotics engineer whose work was linked to groundbreaking research on teleportation. Also, Bell is blocked from a class he must take to qualify for the U.S. Marshal Service; he's shocked to learn the reason.
5)"The Last Sharknado: It's About Time," 8 p.m. Sunday, Syfy, rerunning at 10. This all started in 2013 as noisy nonsense — a movie about a swirling storm, thrusting sharks at us. And then, bizarrely, it caught on. Ever since a new movie each year has had Fin (Ian Ziering) and friends fighting evil forces. We can see the original at 8 a.m., followed by the others at 10 a.m., noon and 2, 4 and 6 p.m. ... ending with Fin wandering through an Earthly apocalypse. Tonight's solution, of course, is to go back in time.
6) "Trial & Error," 9 and 9:30 p.m. Thursday, NBC. This broad (and, often, hilarious) comedy has taken some wild twists lately. Last week, that centered on Dwayne, who is both a police deputy and an assistant for Josh, the defense lawyer. He shattered Josh's timeline argument ... then came up with proof that cleared Lavinia (Kristen Chenoweth) anyway. That led Josh to re-open a case from nine years ago when a genius clockmaker was convicted of killing Lavinia's brother. Preparations for his re-trial begin.
7) "Great Performances," 10 p.m. Friday, PBS. The Imperial Schonbrunn Palace is your typical rural retreat, albeit one with 1,441 rooms. Emperor Franz Joseph lived there, Jackie Chan filmed there, John Kennedy met Nikita Kruschev there. And once a year, the Vienna Philharmonic has a spectacular concert on is grounds. This one, beautifully filmed, starts with the "William Tell Overture" and ends with a Strauss waltz. In between, Anna Netrebko sings the works of Rossini, Verdi, and Puccini.
8) "Ghostbusters" (2016), 8-11 p.m. Saturday, FX. We can spend the night with "Saturday Night Live" people. The "SNL" rerun (11:29 p.m., NBC) has Chance the Rapper hosting and Eminem as musical guest. Prior to that, there's this clever remake, starring two current "SNL" people (Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones), an alumna (Kristen Wiig) and a frequent host or guest (Melissa McCarthy). There are big sight gags and a bonus — Chris Hemsworth's variation on the cliche of a dim-but-attractive secretary.
9) "Finding Nemo" (2003) and "Finding Dory" (2016), 6 and 7:45 p.m. Sunday, Disney. Here is one of the all-time cartoon classics, paired with its sequel. "Nemo" followed a little clownfish who got lost; "Dory" is set six months later when his friend searches for her family. And if you want more cartoons, earlier in the day? Freeform starts a Sunday marathon with the wonderful "Lego Movie" (2014), at 9 a.m. It follows with "Cars" and "Cars 2" (2006, 2001), at 11:05 a.m. and 1:45 p.m., and many more.
10) "Frontline," 9-11 p.m. today and Tuesday, PBS. Most network newspeople rarely get an hour for any subject, unless it's a true-crime story. But PBS is the exception to many rules; here is a two-night, four-hour look at Iran. Thomas Erdbrink, a New York Times correspondent, journeys through the country; he uses humor and curiosity, PBS says, while describing a world often at odds with the conservative clerics and leaders. People talk about martyrdom, visits to the U.S. and protests about headscarves.

Texto completo: [Video: The Twilight Zone: The Comedian - Official Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
Jordan Peele's reboot of the seminal sci-fi series arrives on CBS All Access. And Iggy Pop's four-part documentary series wraps up on Epix.
What's Streaming
THE TWILIGHT ZONE Stream on CBS All Access. March was a big month for Jordan Peele, the Academy Award-winning writer and director behind "Get Out." It began with the opening of his second feature, the widely praised horror film "Us." And on Monday Peele makes his debut as the narrator and host of his reimagining of "The Twilight Zone." Peele has long idolized that groundbreaking Rod Serling sci-fi anthology series. (The premise of "Us" -- about a family besieged by bloodthirsty doppelgängers -- was inspired by the episode "Mirror Image.") The show premieres with two episodes; the first stars Kumail Nanjiani as a fame-seeking comedian, and the second features Adam Scott as a paranoid airline passenger.
ULTRAMAN Stream on Netflix. The original live-action Japanese show "Ultraman" has led to several sequels and spinoffs in multiple mediums since its debut in the 1960s. At the heart of the franchise is the story of a gigantic superbeing who defends Earth from monsters and alien invasions. This iteration, an animated series based on a currently running manga sequel, shifts focus to the original superhero's son, who, whether he likes it or not, has inherited his father's powers.
ONE MILLION AMERICAN DREAMS (2019) Stream on Hulu. Sam Rockwell narrates this documentary about Hart Island, a 101-acre cemetery for about 1 million New Yorkers who never received a proper burial. The Department of Corrections owns the site, which is closed to the public, and pays prison inmates 50 cents an hour to bury the dead. Several families recount how their loved ones wound up there, and their stories are devastating. Glenn Kenny named the movie a Critic's Pick in his review in The New York Times, writing that "it makes a powerful case that the city's lost dead are due more honor than what Hart Island currently extends."
What's on TV
PUNK 10 p.m. on Epix. If you yearn for the days when punk, the genre and the lifestyle, hadn't yet been commodified and commercialized, this limited documentary series is right up your alley. Musicians who birthed the punk rock scene -- Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, Marky Ramone of the Ramones and Debbie Harry of Blondie, to name a few -- look back at the movement with starry-eyed nostalgia. The show comes to a close with a focus on bands that transformed the genre in the 1980s and '90s, such as Nirvana and Bad Religion, and two all-female groups who burst onto the scene: Bikini Kill and L7.
DC'S LEGENDS OF TOMORROW 8 p.m. on the CW. This DC Comics show returns with another time-traveling mess. When the Legends learn that Mona (Ramona Young) has released a fugitive -- though Mona claims her hands are clean -- they head to 1961 Mexico City to settle the matter.

Texto completo: TAMPA, Fla. - Politics are getting pretty weird when The New York Times, the nation's leading champion of liberalism, trashes former Vice President Joe Biden, the only progressive who stands a real chance of routing Donald Trump in a Democratic presidential field chock full of recently anointed celebrity politicians.
Yet that's exactly what the august Times did recently when it argued that Biden was racially biased because he once was "an ardent" opponent of busing to desegregate Delaware's racially segregated schools.
Delaware, nicknamed the First State because it was the first of the original 13 to ratify the Constitution, did drag its feet on desegregation, but finally approved busing for racial balance in 1967.
The governor then was Charles Terry, known as the "Great Divider" because of his hardline stance against fair housing and keeping the National Guard on the streets of Wilmington long after the rioting that exploded after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
In 1968, Biden, a Democrat, supported liberal Republican Russell Peterson for governor. Peterson defeated Terry.
The case against forced busing eventually dissolved in 1974 when the Supreme Court held that students in Detroit's 53 suburban school districts could not be bused into Detroit to offset that city's largely black school enrollment.
Bradley v. Milliken (the state's governor at the time) held that school districts were not compelled to desegregate unless it had been proven that they had drawn specific lines to prevent desegregation.
The Times in its recent blast against Biden argued that his stance against forced busing of schoolchildren would help him attract "the white, blue collar workers who rejected Hillary Clinton in favor Donald Trump."
It noted that Biden believes he could have won that crucial sector in 2016, "and he thinks he can win them now." And it argued that Biden was "a staunch defender of Middle American interests" and that "he could lead the Democrats to victory over Trump, but his political style might affirm the assumptions behind Trumpism."
That charge was a particularly low blow against the man who was Barack Obama's vice president for two terms.
In other words, The New York Times actually argues that Biden might be too electable because he supports Middle American values that a majority of Americans likely believe in.
Those who find comfort in middle class values and supported Trump in 2016 were hoodwinked.
Many annually saw refunds on their federal taxes. This year they found they owe the IRS. Trump's gangbusters economy was largely inherited from Obama. Trump's unwise tariff wars, continued export of quality jobs overseas, and failure to rein in prescription drugs costs and other health care services may have made billions for his uber-wealthy pals, but have placed the economy on a house of cards. Biden would restore stability in the economy and markets without constantly embarrassing America with clown-like antics on the international stage.
It is also likely that Biden would continue the best policies of Barack Obama while, at the same time, avoiding some of Obama's mistakes.
The New York Times aside, what's not to like?
Wayne Madsen's opinion pieces have appeared in most leading European and American newspapers.

Finally, a Woman's Point of View

Texto completo: As revolutions go, this one got off to a quiet and unassuming start in the early 1970's. It was achieved slowly, one female photographer at a time, each hired by The New York Times for her talent with a camera and her desire to practice the best journalism possible.
The men who hired the first of those women quite likely weren't thinking about broadening the prevailing concepts of photojournalism. But over time, as more women were hired or promoted, they could do more than worry about being accepted as staff photographers by using their cameras to simply illustrate someone else's idea of news. They began to push successfully for publication of images that were different, for the truths they saw in people and events, for assignments that had once been denied them, and for assignments that no one had envisioned before.
During the few years that I was the newspaper's Picture Editor, and after, I was lucky enough to be a firsthand witness to some of this gradual but potent change. I saw the difference a more diverse staff made in coverage, saw how the definition of news widened, how tired themes were refreshed and viewpoints shifted, how people who might once have been overlooked became the subjects of compelling photographs.
Each photographer contributed in her own way, drawing on her individual background, experiences and interests, which were sometimes akin to those of the other women and sometimes vastly different. So the pictures they produced are as individual as they are. And because the images have come to our attention in the pages of The Times through the past four decades and more, they now seem familiar, making it easy to forget a time when they were not.
TK ABOUT A FEW
Fortunately, they were all hired and Times photojournalism revitalized. Now's our chance to reacquaint ourselves with their work or to discover it for the first time. Welcome back to the revolution.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

APPLE TURNS TO SERVICES TO INCREASE REVENUE

Texto completo: I'll get to what Apple announced on Monday but first some context as to why its announcement of several new paid services is important to Apple's bottom line.
In the quarter that ended Dec. 29, Apple reported a 15 percent decline in iPhone sales, leading to a 5 percent overall decline in revenue over the same quarter a year ago. But it could have been worse if it weren't for Apple's relatively new revenue stream. The company also announced that services revenue reached an all-time high of $10.9 billion, up 19 percent over the prior year.
The growth in services revenue is very important to Apple. Yes, the company continues to make billions in profit through iPhone sales along with revenue from iPads, Macs and other hardware, including the Apple Watch and its Apple TV device. And despite a slowdown in iPhone sales, its flagship product will continue to bring in plenty of money going forward. But if the company is looking for growth, it must either come up with a new category of hardware, a blockbuster new iPhone that people just have to buy, or come up with other ways to make money, such as selling services.
A study from HYLA Mobile, a mobile-device trade-in company, found that iPhone users trade in their phones about every three years and that number has increased over the past few years as phones get better and, in the case of iPhone, more expensive. In some ways, Apple is a victim of its own success. People like their phones and are holding on to them longer. The same is generally true with Android phones.
The same trend is true with Macs and other PCs. There was a time when PC performance and quality was evolving rapidly but now it's pretty hard to tell much difference between one year's model and the next. This is good news for consumers but not good news for Apple and other companies that make money by selling hardware.
So, to stretch its revenue, Apple is expanding its offerings in ways that bring in money on a monthly basis, just like phone carriers and cable companies. And that's where services come in.
NEW APPLE SERVICES
On Monday, Apple announced an all-you-can-read news service called Apple News Plus along with an online gaming service called Apple Arcade and a TV streaming service called Apple TV Plus. The news service will cost $9.99 a month but Apple didn't specify what it will charge for the TV or gaming service.
Apple TV Plus will feature original content from, among others, the celebrities who showed up at Monday's announcement, including Reese Witherspoon, J.J. Abrams, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. Billed as "a new streaming service where the most creative minds in TV and film tell the kinds of stories only they can," Apple says it will feature "original shows and movies across every genre, exclusively on the Apple TV app."
Apple will make this service available on iPhone, iPad and Mac but also non-Apple hardware such as Samsung, Sony and Vizio smart TVs and the popular Roku streaming device. That's a smart move because it expands the base beyond existing Apple hardware customers.
Apple has deep enough pockets to throw a lot of money toward great content, but it's up against some established players including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and HBO Go. Unlike Apple Music, which was able to tap into basically the same library as its rival Spotify, Apple will have to build up its original content over time, so it may be awhile before this service gains significant traction. It also depends what they plan to charge and whether people feel a strong enough desire for the new content. When I told my wife about the TV service, her reaction was pretty blasé, because we already have plenty of viewing choices with the services we have now.
Apple Arcade is an all-you-can-play streaming gaming service, initially featuring more than 100 new games. Games also can be played offline. There will be a family plan and the service will run only on Apple devices: iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV.
Apple News Plus will include more than 300 publications including the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Wired, Time, Rolling Stone, Fast Company and numerous other periodicals. It does not include two of the most popular national papers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, nor local papers from most cities. The service will cost $9.99 a month, which includes sharing with up to six family members. I like the concept, but I'd be a lot happier with it if it included a lot of local newspapers from around the country. I'm happy to support and pay for local journalism but sometimes I stumble on an article from an out-of-town paper with a paywall and wish I could read it without having to buy a separate subscription for that paper. Some papers, including the Mercury News, offer a limited amount of free article views before requiring a paid subscription.
Apple also announced a credit card called Apple Card, in partnership with Goldman Sachs bank. You sign up from an iPhone and can begin using it from the phone within minutes. You'll also get a titanium MasterCard for your wallet with your name etched on the card. Apple says there will be no fees, not even late fees, and that it will transparently help users keep their balances (and interest payments) under control. One nice feature is that the app will show you the real names of the merchants that charge you rather than the obscure codes that sometimes show up on credit card statements. Apple also said that it will feature low interest rates, but didn't specify the rate. Users will get 2 percent cash back immediately for all non-Apple purchases made with an iPhone using Apple Pay, 1 percent for purchases with the physical card and 3 percent back on Apple purchases.

Texto completo: The news that special counsel Robert Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.
Put aside the rogues' gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
Recall that in 2016, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government," Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, "There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say."
Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up "plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy." In March 2017, he said on "Meet the Press," "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" and last May he told ABC that Trump's Russia conspiracy is of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."
Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion" and declared Trump an agent "working on behalf of the Russians." House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, "It's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that." Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that "the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians."
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy." And recently, the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that "enormous amounts of evidence" exist of collusion between Trump and Russia and that "there's no one that could factually say there's not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians." Except for Mueller, of course.
These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Trump's Helsinki summit, Brennan declared "he is wholly in the pocket of Putin." When challenged by Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," Brennan stood by his assessment. "I called [Trump's] behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."
This month, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell told Brennan this investigation was "developing while you were still on the job" and asked, "Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?" Brennan replied, "I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes." In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that "Trump's claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash."
Now, Brennan feigns contrition. "I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was," he said, adding, "I am relieved that it's been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election."
Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Trump was right to revoke Brennan's security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst, the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Texto completo: E.L. James' latest novel is supposed to be many shades different than the controversial and so popular "Fifty Shades of Grey" that launched her publishing career. "The Mister" is described as a "roller-coaster ride of danger and desire" that takes place in London, Cornwall and the Balkans. James will discuss her novel with Books & Books owner Mitchell Kaplan at 8 p.m. May 1 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts Knight Concert Hall, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami. Tickets cost $35-$55. VIP seating is $55, which includes a meet-and-greet with James as well as priority performance seating and a signed copy of "The Mister." For details, visit BooksAndBooks.com.
'One Amazing Thing'
This year's One Book Boca community-reading selection is "One Amazing Thing" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, who will discuss her novel at 4 p.m. April 13 at the Boca Raton Public Library, 400 NW Second Ave., Boca Raton, 561-393-7852, BocaLibrary.org.
In "One Amazing Thing," nine people trapped together by an earthquake share "one amazing thing" from their lives - personal tales they've never told anyone. A follow-up discussion will be held 7 p.m. April 18.
In addition, discussion guides for book groups will be available at the downtown Boca library; the Spanish River Library, 1501 NW Spanish River Blvd.; and online.
Bookstore on the move
Readers get a double bonus as Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore settles into its new site in the Delray Beach Public Library building, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach. The bookstore and the library will have separate entrances, but the goal of serving readers will be the same.
A bookstore in a library is rare, but not a new concept. With this move, store founder and manager Joanne Sinchuk said she hopes they will complement each other. "We're hoping for a synergy between the two," she said.
While the new space is slightly smaller than the current store, the parking lot is much bigger and should accommodate buyers and library patrons. Murder on the Beach's phone number and hours of operation will remain the same. Contact 561-279-7790, MurderOnTheBeach.com or email murdermb@gate.net for more information.
Murder on the Beach is a locally owned independent bookstore specializing in mystery, suspense and thrillers. It was founded in 1996 by Sinchuk and located in Sunny Isles Beach before moving to Delray Beach in 2002.
Florida's WWII history
New York Times best-selling author Michael J. Tougias will discuss the details behind his nonfiction book "So Close to Home," which chronicles how dozens of U-boats lurked off the Florida coast during WWII, at 2 p.m. April 13 at the Coral Springs Museum of Art, 2855A Coral Springs Drive, 954-340-5000.
Tougias has written more than 25 books about maritime, travel and adventure topics. His 2009 book "The Finest Hours: The True Story Behind the US Coast Guard's Most Daring Rescue" was adapted as a Disney film by the same name in 2016. Visit MichaelTougias.com for more information.
Writers Live! wraps up
The Palm Beach Library System wraps up its annual Writers Live! event with two popular authors. Hank Phillippi Ryan juggles two careers - as an Emmy Award-winning on-air investigative reporter for Boston's NBC affiliate (at last count she had won 34 Emmys) and author of 10 best-selling mysteries. She'll discuss her latest novel, "Trust Me," at 2 p.m. April 17 at the Glades Road Branch Library, 20701 95th Avenue South, Boca Raton, 561-482-4554. Maria Kuznetzova discusses her buzzed-about debut, "Oksana, Behave!," which follows the maturation of a Russian-American girl, at 2 p.m. April 22 at the Jupiter Branch Library, 705 Military Trail, Jupiter, 561-744-2301. Visit PBCLibrary.org/writers-live-2019 for more information.
The basics of poetry
The workshop "What Is a Poem?" lead by Gulf Stream Magazine poetry editor Chloe Firetto-Toomey begins at 1 p.m. May 4 at Old School Square Crest Theatre, Classroom 6, 51 N. Swinton Ave., Delray Beach, 561-243-7922. Cost is $10. The workshop will explore a wide scope of contemporary forms and practices, including reading, class discussion, free writing and the mechanics of poems. For more information, visit PalmBeachPoetryFestival.org.
Get smart about dating
Boca Raton marriage and family therapist Marni Feuerman's new book, "Ghosted and Breadcrumbed: Stop Falling for Unavailable Men and Get Smart about Healthy Relationships," is designed to help women navigate the quagmire of dating. She'll discuss the book at 6:30 p.m. April 12 at Books & Books, 265 Aragon Ave., Coral Gables, 305-442-4408. Hit the link for a short video about Fuerman and "Ghosted and Breadcrumbed."
Is your novella
a prize winner?
Working on a piece of fiction you are proud of? The Miami Book Fair has partnered with the de Groot Foundation to launch the Miami Book Fair/De Groot Prize to be awarded to an unpublished author for a novella. Deadline to submit the novella, which should be between 17,000 and 40,000 words, is May 10. Find out more at miamibookfair.com/degroot.
Romance,
mystery workshops
The timing is good for Coral Springs author Joyce Sweeney to discuss "The Plot Clock," which explores a four-part approach for writers who get lost in their story, at 10 a.m. April 13 during the Florida Romance Writers meeting at the Tigertail Lake Recreational Center, 580 Gulf Stream Way, Dania Beach. Cost, which includes continental breakfast, is $15, $10 for members. Contact Janet Little at janetfrankslittle@gmail.com. Sweeney is an award-winning author of 14 novels for young adults.
Having a website seems like a basic requirement for anyone with a business, or an author who wants to build readership. Yet, even in 2019, some authors do not have one. Graphic designer and writer Tina Koenig will discuss how to build an online presence during a meeting of the Mystery Writers of America's Florida at 11:30 a.m. April 13 at the Embassy Suites, 661 NW 53rd St., Boca Raton. Cost is $30, $25 for members. To register, email ray@rayflynt.com.
Deadline for May Local Books is April 20; email olinecog@aol.com.

Reap results; Ways to focus and increase productivity

Texto completo: Ever wish you had 30 hours in a day to get more stuff done? Then again, how tired would you feel? You may already be exhausted after working eight or nine hours per day.
Well, if you're struggling to juggle work and life while trying to maximize your day without killing your health in the process, remember this: Being more productive doesn't mean working harder or longer; it means working smarter.
Here are six ways to be more productive, the smart way:
1. Cut down the distractions
Distractions are productivity's biggest enemy. To make the most of your day, ax whatever is keeping you from being focused and productive. Take your work environment into account. Is sound/noise, lighting, the way the room is configured, such as open-floor plans, a problem?
Try relocating to a different space or make a case for working remotely. The key is finding out what distractions are messing with your productivity, and then doing something about it.
2. Have good boundaries
Let me ask you: What's most important for you to get done? Whatever it is, focus all your energy on those things.
Take billionaire Warren Buffett, for example. With all the demands on him every day, Buffett learned a long time ago that the greatest commodity of all is time. He simply mastered the art and practice of setting boundaries for himself.
The mega-mogul once said, "The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything."
3. Simplify
Productive people are masters of simplifying things down to what matters most. They have a simple schedule. They live according to their values and purpose. They have no problem saying no to people or things that don't serve them.
If something coming their way on Tuesday has little value and doesn't make them better on Wednesday, they simply walk away.
4. Exercise the Pomodoro Technique
If done correctly, this classic time-management hack can help you get things done in short work intervals. First, decide on the tasks you want to check off from your to-do list. Next, set a timer to 25 minutes and knock off those items until the timer rings.
After you finish, take a five-minute break and repeat the cycle four times. After the fourth cycle, take a 15- to 30-minute break and start over.
The key is to focus on the short bursts, as it helps you to concentrate on your tasks without distractions.
5. Take more breaks
This sounds counterintuitive to being more productive at first, but according to a New York Times article, research shows that "daytime workouts, short afternoon naps, longer sleep hours, more time away from the office, and longer, more frequent vacations" actually boost productivity and job performance.
The truth is, humans aren't wired to concentrate for more than three hours at a time. Anything beyond that without a break and you'll start to experience the negative effects of decision fatigue, lack of focus and even impaired vision.
6. Schedule your to-do list items
This productivity hack helps you be more realistic about what you want to get done.
Cal Newton, author of "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World," says: "Scheduling forces you to confront the reality of how much time you actually have and how long things will take. Now that you look at the whole picture, you're able to get something productive out of every free hour you have in your workday. You not only squeeze more work in, but you're able to put work into places where you can do it best."

Texto completo: The term "modern monetary theory" has been talked about so much lately that we mainstream economists need to try to understand it.
We're having trouble, though I'm beginning to suspect that it may be because M.M.T., as it's often called, is really just a voguish name for a group of old and, for the most part, sensible ideas, repackaged in a new form.
M.M.T. is sometimes invoked to justify reckless government borrowing for marginally good causes, without raising taxes. Well, here's a spoiler alert: Though increased spending on infrastructure, education, social welfare and the environment may be wise, and rising deficits may make sense some of the time, we really cannot borrow ceaselessly without risking real harm.
First, though, what actually is modern monetary theory? Stephanie Kelton of Stony Brook University, an adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 presidential campaign, has emerged as a leading spokeswoman for this theory.
In "How We Think About the Deficit Is Mostly Wrong," a 2017 opinion piece in The New York Times, she said the very first question people asked when confronted by a proposal for increased government spending was, "How are you going to pay for it?"
She called this an "almost Pavlovian" impulse that is "holding us back." Worrying about the deficit, she said, comes from an error in thinking: failing to realize that "the government's deficit is mirrored by an equivalent surplus in another part of the economy."
This seems to be similar to an idea that was popular during the New Deal in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Supporters of the Roosevelt administration dismissed worries about rising national debt, saying it was fine because "we owe it to ourselves." That was a half-truth.
That claim would have been accurate only in an extreme, theoretical case: if everyone had identical government bond holdings and paid identical taxes to cover the interest and principal that they were paying to themselves. In such a hypothetical situation, debt and taxes would cancel each other and the level of government debt would be meaningless. But we are never going to be in that situation in the real world.
In a video, Professor Kelton put the issues in the simplest terms: "The only potential risk with the national debt increasing over time is inflation. And to the extent that you don't believe the U.S. has a long-term inflation problem, you shouldn't believe that the U.S. is facing a long-term debt problem."
Yet by implying that inflation needs to be monitored, she also implied that the government shouldn't borrow and spend excessively, with which I heartily agree.
Furthermore, she was right to say that, in some cases, Americans overreact to government deficits. In fact, there is a long history of disputes by accountants on how deficits should be defined. For example, it has been proposed that the federal government should adopt separate capital and operating budgets -- differentiating long-term investments from operating costs.
But it is not obvious how to do this, and the change has not been made. These accounting issues are technical and don't provide useful slogans for influencing public opinion, as modern monetary theory does.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York may be the theory's most visible supporter. In her advocacy of the Green New Deal program that she introduced with a fellow Democrat, Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, she has used the theory to dismiss criticisms that increased spending would require increased taxation.
Yet the Green New Deal -- which the Republican-controlled Senate rejected on Tuesday in a procedural vote -- looks awfully expensive. When the cost of her plan was pointed out to her in a National Public Radio interview with Steve Inskeep last month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said: "I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure."
When pressed, however, she said,"When we decide to go into the realm of deficit spending, we have to do so responsibly." Because there are great opportunities for government investment at the moment and interest rates are low, these programs should go forward with deficit spending. Once again, this is a conventional argument: It makes sense to spend when the return on government investments exceeds the borrowing rate.
These are reasonable ideas. They are not always expressed in ways that are appealing to mainstream economists, however, so it's not surprising that two Harvard economists recently wrote articles severely criticizing modern monetary theory. Kenneth Rogoff did so in "Modern Monetary Nonsense," while Lawrence Summers wrote, "The Left's Embrace of Modern Monetary Theory Is a Recipe for Disaster."
I wouldn't be that harsh. It seems that modern monetary theory is not so much a recipe for disaster as it is a not entirely original series of ideas that are not well defined or well integrated, and whose implications have been exaggerated.
Entire fields of study in economics departments are devoted to grappling with some of these problems. For a serious examination of issues concerning public debt, for example, consider the classic 1979 study "On the Determination of the Public Debt," by Robert Barro of Harvard.
Professor Barro said, in essence, that the government faced time-varying expenditure needs and, optimally, could attempt to keep tax rates constant by varying borrowing. Then there is the 1936 opus of John Maynard Keynes, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," which prescribes countercyclical deficit spending to stabilize the economy.
Are such works new enough to be called "modern"? If so, they might be considered the core foundations for modern monetary theory, though I haven't seen them cited that way.
But I don't expect most people to read these dense works on public finance and macroeconomic theory. It's more likely that people who aren't professional economists will be influenced by simpler stories and metaphors that may, unfortunately, encourage fallacious thinking.
Still, I think the modern monetary theorists have a point: We should not react automatically against new expenditures that increase the deficit. There do appear to be some urgent needs that might justify more debt for a while. But acknowledging this does not require a revolution in economic theory, and it does not license unlimited spending or carelessly adding debt upon debt.

Texto completo: Alex Jones, who claimed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was staged, may now be blaming his opinion on “a form of psychosis” he had in the past “where I basically thought everything was staged ... even though I’m learning a lot of things aren’t staged.”
According to published reports, those claims were made earlier this month when Jones was grilled during an Austin, Texas, deposition taken in connection with one of the lawsuits brought by parents of some of the 20 children killed in the 2012 shooting.
Gunman Adam Lanza, who also killed his mother and six educators during the mass shooting, killed himself as police approached the school.
Jones spent more than three hours answering questions posed by lawyers in a suit claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress brought on behalf of Jessie Lewis, one of the slain children, by his mother, Scarlett Lewis.

The Lewis suit is just one of several lawsuits against Jones and others pending in Texas, Virginia and Connecticut.
The video of the deposition was posted in two parts on YouTube.
Jones often ran his hands through his neatly trimmed beard and short hair and took deep breaths, which he loudly exhaled.
At one point, as he was questioned about people debunking his theory and the debates that followed, Jones said “I don’t live, eat, breathe and sleep this stuff. If I had it all over to do, I would have done a better job. I didn’t do it on purpose to be malicious.”
It was not long after the shooting that Jones maintained on his “InfoWars” program that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax, part of a government attempt to pass laws that would limit the right to bear arms.
Jones has claimed the school shooting was staged by paid actors who faked the children’s deaths.
The Austin American-Statesman said Jones told the lawyers during the Texas deposition, “It’s painful that we have to question big public events. I think that’s an essential part of the First Amendment in America.”
But, even as he said he has come to believe over the years that the Sandy Hook shootings were real, he continued in the deposition to voice conspiratorial suspicions that the whole truth about what happened remained hidden, the American-Statesman reported.
“I think we’ve agreed before that Sandy Hook was real. It was not staged. It was not phony. You were wrong about that,” said Mark Bankston of the Texas law firm of Farrar and Ball, representing Lewis, said, according to the Statesman.
“Well, I want to be clear,” Jones replied, according to the Statesman. “I believe children died. I believe there was a mass shooting. I still think that there was a man in the woods in camo. ... And just a lot of experts I’ve talked to, including retired FBI agents and other people and people high up in the Central Intelligence Agency, have told me that there is a cover-up in Sandy Hook.”
Asked toward the end of the deposition whether “people should be accountable for the people they hurt,” Jones replied “sometimes people claim they’ve been hurt when they haven’t been. So you have to look at the agenda behind things. You have to balance things about why has the mainstream media lied so much, why our government’s lied so much, the fact that the public doesn’t believe what they’re told anymore, and are we going to criminalize questioning Jussie Smollett or WMDs or babies in incubators. And it really is the fact that we’ve allowed the government and institutions to become so corrupt that people have lost any compass of what’s real.”
Bankston asked Jones about the assertion by his lawyers at a pretrial hearing in his 2017 child custody case that in his on-air persona, Jones was a “performance artist.”
“So I want to ask you, I want to know,” Bankston asked. “When you were making these claims about Sandy Hook, were you being a journalist, or was this all performance art?”
“When I say things on air, I believe it,” Jones said.
Bankston asked Jones about his relationship with Wolfgang Halbig, described as a former Florida school security officer.
Halbig, according to The New York Times, “promoted a baseless tale that Avielle Richman, one of the first-graders killed in Sandy Hook, was still alive.”
Just this week, Richman’s father, Jeremy took his life near his office of the Avielle Foundation at the Edmond Town Hall in Newtown. The Foundation is a nonprofit organization that studies brain science.
Earlier this month, Connecticut Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis gave families of the slain children the right to interview Jones under oath for five hours as part of the lawsuit discovery process. She also recommended the case be moved to the complex litigation docket in state Superior Court in Waterbury, where she will be sitting beginning Sept. 1.
In another matter, a federal judge in Virginia refused to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought against Jones by the Georgetown Law School’s Civil Rights Clinic on behalf of Brennan Gilmore. Gilmore was a counterprotester who filmed the car attack that killed Heather Heyer and injured 36 others during the 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Va.

Texto completo: Jimmy Butler will have a homecoming that could feature many more boos than cheers.
The 76ers will visit the Timberwolves on Saturday. It will be Butler's first game in Minnesota since he was traded to the Sixers on Nov. 12 with Justin Patton for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a 2022 second-round draft pick.
Last year, in his only full season in Minnesota, Butler helped lead the Timberwolves to their first playoff appearance in 14 years. But Butler, who can opt out of the final year of his contract this summer to become a free agent, didn't endear himself to Timberwolves fans right before the start of this season. Shortly before training camp, he told the team he wanted to be traded.
Butler did play 10 games this season with the Timberwolves before being dealt.
Earlier this week, he told the New York Times, "They are going to boo me." Then he added, "I would boo me, too."
* The Celtics have banned a fan from their games for two years for being verbally abusive toward the Warriors during their only visit to Boston this season.
The team says it didn't enforce a lifetime ban because its investigation couldn't prove that the fan used a racial slur toward Golden State forward DeMarcus Cousins.
According to a Yahoo! report, Cousins said the fan "muttered" a racial slur at him on Jan. 26.
The Celtics say the fan, who is a minor, was ejected from the game immediately after they received the complaint.

Texto completo: Flight 1619 is now boarding on stage
NEW YORK - The lights are down barely three seconds before mayhem breaks loose at the Public Theater's production of "Ain't No Mo'." That's when the regular recorded welcome from Oskar Eustis, the Public's artistic director, gets rudely and hilariously hijacked by Peaches, an airport gate attendant making a preboarding announcement.
"Ladies and gentlemen" - and that's as much as I can quote, because Peaches, who is also the play's author, Jordan E. Cooper, has quite the vocabulary. But the gist is this: Fasten your seat belts; it's going to be a bumpy night.
Yes, "Ain't No Mo'," which opened Wednesday, is bumpy. It's also thrilling, bewildering, campy, shrewd, mortifying, scary, devastating and deep.
What Cooper has attempted, and director Stevie Walker-Webb has brought close to fruition, is nothing less than a spiritual portrait of Black American life right now, with all its terrors, hopes and contradictions. But this is no naturalistic living-room drama. To bring his jumble of feelings to life, Cooper grabs every genre he can. Satire, allegory, minstrelsy and speculative fiction all come into it.
The result is an anthology of loosely linked bits built on a shocking premise: What if at some point in the "beyond now," in order to solve the problem of racism in America without whites having to do anything, the government offered all Black citizens descended from slaves one-way airfare back to Africa? And what if almost all of them took up the offer?
Certainly Peaches plans to go; it's a good deal with a lousy alternative. "If you stay here," she says, "you only got two choices for guaranteed housing, and that's either a cell or a coffin."
As it turns out, Peaches is the sole check-in agent for African-American Airlines Flight 1619. (The number isn't random.) Dressed in a pink faux-alligator-skin suit, with a model airplane perched in her matching pink wig, she has the brilliant patter but not quite the patience to get the job done.
You might say the same of the play, which alternates between scenes with Peaches that are reliably effective and others, in various styles, that sometimes land and sometimes crash.
And sometimes soar. The first, set Nov. 4, 2008, is an orgiastical-ly over-the-top funeral for Brother "Righttocomplain" - an allegorical figure representing centuries of justifiable black grievance. ("He had many mothers and fathers, and too many children with too many mothers to even begin to count.") With the election that night of President Barack Obama, and thus the end of "our suffering as people in this wretched land," he is finally being laid to rest.
Or so the wailing mourners, led by their supercharged, Jheri-curled pastor (Marchant Davis) believe. But the rest of the play, which takes place after the election of President Donald Trump, revokes the anticipated respite from racism. What follows is worse: a backlash against black Americans inflamed by white fear of their rising status.
The result is a twofold destruction of souls and bodies. In a segment called "Circle of Life," set at the "Sister Girl We Slay All Day Cause Beyoncé Say Community Center," Trisha (Fedna Jacquet) waits for an abortion, unwilling to give birth to another victim. She is No. 73,545 in a line of millions.
In "Real Baby Mamas of the Southside," a parody of the Real Housewives franchise, Black women enact scripts that portray them as tacky "bitches" and "hos." Even stranger, and funnier until it isn't, is that white women want to enact those scripts, too. One of the Baby Mamas - Rachonda, nee Rachel (Simone Ricasner) - resents her "transphobic" castmates for mocking her journey to Blackness, which involves a regimen of daily doses of Hennessy and "The Color Purple."
The enjambment of outrage and outrageousness electrifies these scenes. But as the exodus approaches and the material grows darker, the show sometimes loses its edge. "Green," about rich Black families who have literally buried their Blackness, doesn't really mesh with the play's superstructure. And Peaches' final scene, as the flight to Africa'departs with millions on it, eventually buckles under the weight of its needing to end the play with a bang.
"Ain't No Mo'" is no less rich for that. Despite its big laughs and no-you-didn't surprises, it builds a trenchant argument. Cooper is asking whether racism is so hopelessly intertwined with black life - and black life so integral to American identity - that separation, even if desirable, is impossible. What do the emigres leave behind when they board that plane? What does America lose in the process?
I will not give away how Cooper literalizes these questions with a powerful piece of luggage called Miss Bag. Nor why, in a beautiful scene, a guard (Ebony Marshall-Oliver) must beg the last inmate of a women's prison (Crystal Lucas-Perry) to take her freedom. I will only say that the best parts of "Ain't No Mo'" master a complicated trick: pulling wrenching drama out of a party hat of borrowed theatrical attitudes.
Quite an achievement for a 24-year-old playwright who was in middle school when Obama was elected and is making his professional debut. But Cooper isn't starting from zero. The play's overall structure owes a big debt (acknowledged prominently) to "The Colored Museum" by George C. Wolfe, which in 1984 set out to blow up the previous 30 years of Black representation in American culture. Peaches is in some ways a curtsy to Miss Pat, that play's pink-clad stewardess character, who advises the passengers on a "celebrity slave ship" to fasten their shackles.
Cooper has a lot more to blow up now than even Wolfe did. (He started writing the play after the killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling in the summer of 2016.) The play is not, in that sense, easy. It is scathing about whites but also about Blacks. And, finally, happiest laughing about both.
It helps that Walker-Webb, directing his first off-Broadway production, has brought the play to such vivid, headlong comic life. The fabulous costumes by Montana Levi-Blanco do a lot of that work but so do Kimie Nishikawa's sets, Adam Honore's lighting, Emily Auciello's sound and, obviously, Cookie Jordan's wigs. As good satire must, "Ain't No Mo'" has a tightly unified aesthetic.
But to the extent it is not just satire, it makes unusual demands on its actors. The five so-called passengers, who play many characters in a broad range of styles, all shine, and Cooper as Peaches nearly explodes.
So yes: a flight.
But then, America is a bumpy flight. For some Americans it has been relentlessly so for 400 years. In trying to carve out new forms to explore that, Cooper - like other young Black playwrights writing so expressively right now - is continuing the work of "The Colored Museum," which asked, as Frank Rich wrote in his review for The New York Times, how Black men and women could "at once honor and escape the legacy of suffering that is the baggage of their past."
Here's how.

Texto completo: All the elements for swiftly legalizing marijuana in New Jersey seemed to be in place: A proposed bill was enthusiastically backed by Gov. Philip D. Murphy and had been endorsed by leaders of the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. Also, statewide polls showed support for the issue.
Then the plans unravelled.
Some lawmakers were unsure about how to tax marijuana sales. Others feared legalization would flood the state's congested streets and high ways with impaired drivers. Some would not be deterred from believing that marijuana was a dangerous menace to public health.
A disagreement existed among lawmakers about how far to go regarding the social justice component in the legalization bill: Fissures grew over whether it was necessary to expunge criminal records for marijuana-related offenses for those found with as much as 5 pounds of the drug.
"Five pounds is a lot of pot," said Christopher Bateman, a Republican senator who had been considered a swing vote, but had come out recently opposite legalization. "That's not you and I smoking a little bit. That's a dealer on he corner, selling and distributing."
All of thIs turmoil put New Jersey's legalization efforts in jeopardy, and despite more than 100 calls, texts and personal entreaties from Murphy to legislators n a final frenzied week, the bill abruptly collapsed Monday.
The failure in New Jersey revealed the difficulties for legalizing marijuana, especially through legislative efforts, rather than the ballot measures used in nine states where the drug has been legalized.
Lawmakers in New Jersey, along with those in New York and Connecticut, hare tried to painstakingly craft legislation to avoid the problems encountered by states like Colorado, which in 2014 became the first to sell legal marijuana, and has since endured unflattering headlines.
A report released Monday showed an increase in emergency room visits in Colorado as the drug has become more readily available.
For states like California and Massachusetts, legalizing marijuana has led to some negative results: under-whelmingtax revenue; a host of public heath and safety concerns, such as keeping the drug out of teenagers' hands; and a burgeoning industry determinated by white corporate interests even as advocates in Hispanic and Black communities say their neighborhoods have been most negatively affected by the drug.
"This is a significant shift in public policy, so it comes as little surprise that lawmakers are taking a very deliberative approach," said Steve Hawkins, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington. "I is easy to grow impatient following decades of enduring a failed policy of marijuana prohibition, but huge strikes are being taken in these states and others around the country."
Given what other states have encountered, New Jersey and other states facing financial challenges are reconsidering the possible financial benefits of legalization. Tax revenues in California have fallen well short of projections, and a black market for marijuana continues to thrive, which some cannabis businesses experts attribute to high taxes.
Legislators in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are also working to answer demands that legalization benefit minority populations disproportionately affected by the war on drugs by providing job training and ensuring they get licenses to sell or grow marijuana.
In New Jersey, the legalization bill caps the number of licenses to prevent flooding the market, establishes a regulatory commission that could respond to market fluctuations and applies a sales tax based on weight rather than as a percentage to ensure a steady revenue stream.
New Jersey also pursued one of the country's most liberal expunction programs by offering a clean slate for those who had been convicted of possessing up to 5 pounds of marijuana, an amount higher than any other state. The bill said that some licenses would be reserved for communities with high rates of marijuana arrests and unemployment in an attempt to diversify the industry.
The struggles in New Jersey and the slowdown of negotiations in New York have given opponents hope of forestalling or stopping future legalization efforts.
"There's a lot of backlash about the idea that we have to sell pot gummy bears to achieve social justice," said Kevin A. Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a nonprofit organization that opposes legalization. He added that he's seen an increase in opposition among some Black and Latino lawmakers. "They're seeing it's safe to be a Democrat and anti-legalization."
In New Jersey, some of the loudest opposition came from powerful African-American lawmakers.
Ronald L. Rice, a Democratic senator from Newark, argued that legalization would lead to "marijuana bodegas," which would further push the drug into poor urban communities.
Shirley Turner, a Black Democratic state senator, visited Colorado to see how legalization worked, and returned worried about whether teenagers would be tempted to try the drug if it was legal.
And Nia Gill, another Black Democratic senator and a former speaker of the Assembly, cited a Colorado study that found that even after legalization, marijuana arrest rates for Black residents were nearly double that of white residents. (Even in states where marijuana is legal, certain limits apply to how much people can possess and at what age they can use it.)
"The disparity is never alleviated because the disparity has to do with policing," she said. "The disparity does not have to do with legalization of marijuana."
Murphy reached out repeatedly to Black lawmakers to assuage their concerns. He also courted the support of civil rights leaders, like Rev. Al Sharpton and Richard T. Smith, president of the New Jersey chapter of the NAACP, as well as African-American celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg.
Days before the scheduled vote, Murphy held a news conference while surrounded by religious leaders and civil rights activists.
But it was not enough to win over the most senior African-American Democrats who were holding out.
"I think we need to look before we leap,'' Turner said.
A coalition of veteran white lawmakers, including former law enforcement officials, remained concerned about thwarting driving under the influence of marijuana.
In Colorado, officials are still unprepared to deal with this challenge, and have yet to develop authoritative field sobriety tests and reliable lab testing, according to a report from the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice.
The New Jersey bill would set up a task force focused on policing marijuana and driving and would offer to reimburse communities that hired law enforcement officers trained to recognize drivers impaired by drugs.
But it was not enough to sway some lawmakers.
"We have a million more registered cars on the road than Colorado," Bateman said.
In the end, the effort in New Jersey was also sunk by more parochial political reasons. Despite having a stranglehold on state government, Murphy and Stephen M. Sweeney, the Democratic Senate president, have had a frosty relationship and never truly mounted a unified effort to do the arm-twisting to secure the necessary votes until the final few days.
Murphy, however, would not admit defeat, saying the decision to call off the vote was merely a setback. Still, no one has said when the bill might be resurrected or whether a new strategy will be deployed.
"Eventually barriers do fall," Murphy told reporters, "to those who are committed to breaking them down." - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: La Cruz Roja anunció este viernes que distribuirá la ayuda humanitaria destinada para Venezuela, luego de que el mandatario Nicolás Maduro aceptara la intervención de este organismo internacional para aliviar la crisis humanitaria, que hasta ahora se ha negado a reconocer oficialmente.
Según reportó el diario The New York Times, Maduro autorizó a la Cruz Roja para que reparta toneladas de ayuda humanitaria que se destinarán a unos 650,000 venezolanos durante los próximos meses.
“Estimamos que en un plazo de aproximadamente 15 días estaremos preparados para brindar la ayuda”, dijo Francesco Rocca, presidente de la Federación Internacional de la Cruz Roja.
La Cruz Roja destacó que se trataba de “una labor técnica”, que no debía ser utilizada como munición política en la disputa por el poder entre el presidente interino Juan Guaidó y el mandatario Nicolás Maduro.
El enviado especial de Estados Unidos a Venezuela, Elliot Abrams, dijo a la agencia de noticias EFE que estaba contento de ceder a un “instrumento fiable” las toneladas de ayuda estadounidense que actualmente se encuentran almacenadas en Cúcuta, Colombia.
“Estaríamos felices de hacerlo, si hubiera un instrumento fiable para distribuir la ayuda, puede ser la Cruz Roja, la Iglesia, Cáritas, que le den la ayuda a la gente que la necesita sin ninguna base política, entonces estaríamos felices de hacerlo por ese canal”, dijo Abrams.
Anteriormente, Guaidó había intentado sin éxito introducir la ayuda a Venezuela, pero la oposición de los militares leales a Maduro y de grupos armados afines a su Gobierno imposibilitó su traslado.
“Estamos abiertos a todas las donaciones”, dijo Rocca. “Estamos dispuestos a negociar con cualquiera”, añadió.
Guaidó aplaudió de inmediato el anuncio de la Cruz Roja, en lo que pareció una inevitable politización de la medida.
“Esto es resultado de nuestra presión e insistencia. La lucha por el bien de todos da frutos”, dijo el presidente interino.
Guaidó y Maduro se disputan la presidencia del país desde que Guaidó se autoproclamó como el mandatario legítimo, según las disposiciones constitucionales, y más de 50 países lo reconocieron.
Luego Guaidó intentó llevar alimentos y medicinas para aliviar las necesidades de la población, sin embargo, el gobierno de Maduro negó que hubiera una crisis humanitaria en Venezuela.
Desde entonces Maduro ha recibido cargamentos con suministros provenientes de China y Rusia, mientras que Guaidó hizo lo mismo con ayuda enviada por Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea.

Can responsible journalism make a comeback?

Texto completo: Let me share my view of responsible journalism, its current state, how the deck is stacked against it, and my optimistic, possibly delusional, forecast of its restoration.
Responsible journalism is the timely and factual reporting of events with adequate background and perspective and with sufficient reliable sources that readers, listeners, or viewers can be informed to make rational decisions about its importance and relevance.
Former ABC News anchor Ted Koppel has said that the New York Times and Washington Post are out to get President Donald Trump. It has been reported that 92 percent of main stream media coverage of President Trump is negative.
Progressives are generally given a pass. A Reuters' reporter held a negative story about Beto O'Rourke until after the Senate election in which he was running. It seems that the main stream media has largely become a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party.
Social media and search engines have displayed a bias against conservatives. As the special prosecutor concluded there was no President Trump collusion with the Russians in the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prizes had been awarded for fake news.
The deck is clearly stacked against objective reporting and responsible journalism. Progressives dominate universities and journalism schools. The "cultural elite" rewards progressive agendas. Progressives dominate education at all levels and conservative thought is discouraged or punished. Squashing, not honestly debating, has been the left's approach.
Print media are struggling financially. Broadcast media have been under stress as well. Time, financial constraints, the pressures of competition, and displaying political correctness corrupt reporting. The Internet provides alternatives for those who increasingly distrust traditional media.
The lure of another blockbuster Watergate story that brings down the President continues to cloud the emotions and ambitions and expectations of some, many, or maybe even most aspiring journalists. Being first or most dramatic or most damning of the right has become more important than being accurate.
Behavior that is rewarded is encouraged. Behavior that is punished is discouraged. Voices and actions are now competing with the cheers of progressive associates and establishment and cultural elites trying to skew reporting ever leftward.
Nicholas Sandman, the Covington, Kentucky, Catholic High School student who was viciously condemned in the media to the point of receiving threats at home based on a shortened video which when seen in its entirety showed him to the victim and not the victimizer has sued the Washington Post and CNN for $250 million each. He has good lawyers and I believe a favorable settlement will result which will chill the ruthless abandon with which propagandizing leftists unfairly attack their perceived enemies.
Devin Nunes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee has sued Twitter for $250 million for bias and suppression of conservative input. He is less likely to prevail, but the message is being sent that progressives will no longer enjoy blanket immunity for reckless and vile defamation, even of public figures.
One reason President Trump is so reviled is that he responds with vigor to all attacks, unlike other Republicans who patiently endured in a hopeless attempt to win media favor.
Solid local reporting and some general push-back against misleading reporting against Trump, fueled by the Mueller Report, will also help. Declining readership and viewership will eventually exact a measure of accountability. History has shown itself to be cyclic. Responsible journalism will again be fashionable, though perhaps not before the parousia.

Texto completo: A renowned British balloonist and scientist who set 79 world ballooning records died Tuesday at a hospital after a balloon-related accident over the weekend near Warner Springs in San Diego County.
Julian Richard Nott, 74, was injured Sunday in a bizarre accident several hours after his pressurized, high-altitude cabin and balloon landed east of Palomar Mountain, according to an obituary on his website and information provided by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.
Nott lived in Santa Barbara.

According to the obituary, Nott's partner of 30 years was by his side as he "passed away peacefully" Tuesday from injuries that resulted from "an extraordinary and unforeseeable accident following a successful balloon flight and landing in Warner Springs."
"Julian was flying an experimental balloon that he invented [and] designed to test high-altitude technology," the obituary said.
Nott landed the balloon safely about 12:45 p.m., but about three hours later, "as he was packing up the cabin, it tumbled down the mountain with him inside," Roberta Greene, a spokeswoman for Nott's family, wrote in an email.
"He sustained multiple head [and other] injuries."
Sheriff's Lt. Dustin Lopez said deputies were notified of the accident about 3:30 p.m.
According to the Federation Aeronautique Internationale -- also known as the FAI or the World Air Sports Federation -- Nott set a Guinness World Record in 2017, at age 72, for the highest documented tandem skydiving jump, from 31,916 feet.
The FAI website also lists dozens of Nott's other world records for feats of altitude, distance and time aloft.
Nott was profiled in the New York Times in 1986 during the planning of what he hoped would be the first nonstop balloon flight around the world. That attempt and several more failed, but they were notable because of how deadly previous attempts by other veteran pilots had been.
In 2014, Nott helped Alan Eustace break the record for the world's highest parachute jump, from an altitude of 135,890 feet.
Nott was the ballooning consultant for the world-record jump, which began nearly 7,800 feet higher than the much-hyped jump by Felix Baumgartner and Red Bull.
Lopez said deputies were twice sent Sunday afternoon to the landing site where Nott was fatally injured.
About 12:45 p.m., the deputies were alerted to a possible aircraft crash, but upon arrival learned that Nott's experimental balloon and pressurized cabin had made a soft landing in the area and nobody was injured, Lopez said.
Deputies were again sent to the site around 3:30 p.m., this time with word that two people had suffered injuries, Lopez said. Patrol deputies and a sheriff's helicopter responded.
There is no information on the name or condition of the second person.
Both men were airlifted away by a sheriff's helicopter crew, then taken by a second helicopter to Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, Lopez said.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's choice to lead the Interior Department, David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who has been accused of conflicts of interest, faced questioning Thursday from senators who must decide whether he is the right person to oversee some 500 million acres of public land and vast coastal waters.
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, where Mr. Bernhardt testified, called his qualifications "unparalleled," and other Republicans praised his experience and ethics. But a senior Democrat, Ron Wyden of Oregon, unleashed a scathing rebuke, telling Mr. Bernhardt, "You're just another corrupt official."
Seated behind him in the hearing room was a protester costumed as a green swamp creature, an apparent reference to Mr. Trump's pledge to "drain the swamp" of lobbyist influence in Washington policy circles.
Mr. Bernhardt contended that one of his top priorities would be to focus on overhauling the ethics culture of the agency, which has a history of corruption and scandals. He said in his prepared remarks he aimed "to ingrain a culture of ethical compliance."
In particular, Mr. Bernhardt said he hoped to overhaul the reputation of an agency that became notorious for corruption scandals during the George W. Bush administration, when the deputy secretary of the interior, J. Steven Griles, was sentenced to prison for lying to a Senate committee about his ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Mr. Bernhardt was the Interior Department's solicitor then.
More recently, the Trump administration's previous interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, resigned amid allegations of ethics misconduct. Mr. Zinke has denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Bernhardt also vowed to balance conservation of public lands with a push to develop oil and gas, citing his boyhood in the rural town of Rifle, Colorado, and summers spent on his grandparents' ranch in Wyoming. "You know that I love the outdoors and that I hunt and fish," he said.
Outside the Senate office building where he spoke, protesters dressed as polar bears marched with signs reading, "Save the Arctic from Bernhardt," and "Bernhardt: Most Conflicted Member of Trump's Cabinet."
The committee must decide whether to send Mr. Bernhardt's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Mr. Bernhardt, who has served as deputy secretary since August 2017, has been a powerful force advancing what Mr. Trump has called his "energy dominance" agenda of opening federal lands and waters to oil drilling and energy exploration. He was nominated by Mr. Trump after the departure of Mr. Zinke.
He has been dogged through his tenure by accusations of conflicts of interest. In particular, Mr. Bernhardt's critics contend that, given his past as a lobbyist and lawyer for energy and agricultural interests, his policy decisions stand to benefit former clients.
Senator Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, pressed him on those issues.
"Mr. Bernhardt, you came to my office to tell me that you were the guy who stood up for ethics in the George W. Bush administration," he said, noting that Mr. Bernhardt claimed that he had told Julie MacDonald, a Bush administration official who resigned over revelations that she had interfered with the scientific findings of federal biologists, to "clean up her act."
But Senator Wyden then cited documents revealed in a New York Times investigation published this week showing that Mr. Bernhardt had intervened to block the release of a scientific report revealing the threat presented by three widely used pesticides to hundreds of endangered species, including the kit fox and the seaside sparrow.
"You asked to come to my office to say your ethics are unimpeachable," Senator Wyden said. "But these documents make it look like you're just another corrupt official. Why would you come to my office to lie to me about your ethics? Just like Julie MacDonald, you meddled in the science."
Mr. Bernhardt pushed back against the Times investigation, saying, "The news report you're citing is not even close to true."
Mr. Bernhardt has been the central policy architect not only of the administration's efforts to open public land to energy companies, but also of a plan loosen key provisions of the Endangered Species Act and to weaken safety and environmental rules on oil and gas drilling equipment.
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Bernhardt will become one of two former lobbyists overseeing the nation's top environmental agencies. The other is Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who heads the Environmental Protection Agency. Like Mr. Bernhardt, Mr. Wheeler was a deputy who ascended to lead his agency after his former boss -- Scott Pruitt, in the case of the E.P.A. -- resigned amid allegations of corruption.
As a partner in the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Mr. Bernhardt lobbied for the oil companies Cobalt International Energy and Samson Resources. His legal clients included the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents dozens of oil companies, and Halliburton Energy Services, the oil and gas extraction firm that was led by Dick Cheney before he became vice president.
As deputy secretary of the Interior Department, Mr. Bernhardt was the lead author of a revision of a program to protect tens of millions of acres of habitat of the imperiled sage grouse, a puffy-chested, chicken-like bird found in 10 oil-rich Western states. His final sage grouse plan, issued this month, would strip away protections from about nine million acres of the bird's habitat, a move that, in a stroke, opened up more land to oil and gas drilling than any other single policy action by the Trump administration.
Mr. Bernhardt is also the chief author of a major plan, expected to be finalized and made public in the days or weeks after his Senate confirmation, that would allow the federal government to lease almost any part of the United States coastline to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling.
In Thursday's Senate hearing, Mr. Bernhardt also faced criticism for his actions during the 35-day government shutdown this year.
During that time, while thousands of federal employees were furloughed and government services shut down, Mr. Bernhardt brought back workers in offices that permit and inspect oil and gas drilling. In that period, those workers approved 15 new leases for drilling on public lands as well as 71 new permits for offshore drilling, and more than 50 recipients of the offshore drilling permits were companies that sit on the board of directors of the National Ocean Industries Association, a former client of Mr. Bernhardt's.
Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, pressed Mr. Bernhardt as to why he led the push to continue the agency's work on drilling but not on conservation, maintaining national parks or permitting renewable energy programs.
Mr. Bernhardt said he made those decisions in part to continue with the safety inspections of offshore drilling vessels. And he said that the restrictions of the agency's budget allowed for paid work on the oil and gas programs, but not on conservation and parks programs, in part because when the agency permits an oil or gas lease, it then receives a fee from the company, which can be used to pay workers in the program.
"There was money to do certain things and not other things," he said. "I made the decision to put folks to work that I could."
Key Republicans are backing Mr. Bernhardt's nomination, which is expected to pass the Senate. In 2017, he was confirmed to his post as deputy interior secretary on a party-line vote of 53 to 43.
However, Mr. Bernhardt's opponents have doubled down on a campaign that they hope will turn a handful Republican votes against him.
One advocacy group, the Western Values Project, has opened a television and digital advertising campaign in Arizona and Colorado aimed at persuading the Republican senators of those states, Martha McSally and Cory Gardner, to vote against Mr. Bernhardt's nomination. Both of those senators are up for re-election in 2020 in states where polling shows that voters value conservation of public lands and national parks.
Senator McSally pressed Mr. Bernhardt over reports of sexual harassment in the Interior Department's National Park Service, particularly over the case of Christine Lehnertz, the first female superintendent of the Grand Canyon, who was hired to investigate reports of sexual harassment but resigned this year after her attorney said she received "malicious and defamatory" treatment.
"When I see what's going on at Grand Canyon National Park over the years, it sounds atrocious," said Senator McSally, who this month revealed that she was raped while serving in the Air Force. "It sounds like a bunch of frat boys, bullying and harassing."
She told Mr. Bernhardt, "This is about your leadership, up and down the chain."
Mr. Bernhardt responded that he has worked systemically to address issues of sexual harassment and, noting his 13-year-old daughter, who sat behind him during his testimony, added, "I cannot have an environment where if Katie, my daughter, wants to work at the National Park Service, she would be threatened."
Senator Gardner, who described himself as a lifelong friend of Mr. Bernhardt's, offered effusive praise of his fellow Coloradan. "David Bernhardt is an honest man who puts all his cards on the table and keeps his word," said Senator Gardner, who appeared to grow angry at allegations of Mr. Bernhardt's ethical conflicts. "He is a champion of conservation," he said. "There is zero question that Mr. Bernhardt is qualified to do this job."
Other opponents of Mr. Bernhardt are focused on highlighting accusations of ethical violations, some of which stem from a February New York Times investigation that revealed that Mr. Bernhardt had personally directed a policy to weaken endangered species protections on a California fish, a change that could directly benefit one of his former lobbying clients, the Westlands Water District.
At least four senators and four government ethics watchdog groups have requested that the Interior Department's inspector general open an investigation into the matter. It is not known if an investigation is underway.

Covering Start-Ups and Surrounded by Paper

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Erin Griffith, a start-ups and venture capital reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech she's using.
You focus on start-ups. Do any of the tech products you use come from start-ups?
If very old, highly valued pre-I.P.O. companies like Slack, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and Pinterest still count as start-ups, then yes, every day. Every few minutes! I'm Slacking in between each sentence I write.
We're no longer in an era when hot new social media apps are bubbling up every few months, and if they are, I've aged out of the early-adopter demographic. Now whenever I stumble upon a new social media app, my only "friends" using it are the venture capitalists I write about. (Even those apps tend to be copied or bought by Facebook.)
I use Nuzzel, which sends alerts for stories my Twitter friends are talking about. This is a good way to catch things that elude push notifications and newsletters, including whatever hate-read everyone is angry about.
Pocket, an app for saving articles, lets me feel better about not finishing all the Important Long Reads I encounter throughout the day. I can tell myself I'll get to them later. (I probably won't.)
Giphy, a search engine for GIFs, allows me to express myself when words, emojis or Bitmojis are not enough.
I also use a combination of Swarm, the check-in app that grew out of Foursquare; an IFTTT (If This, Then That) recipe; and Google Calendar to record my whereabouts. It's helpful for doing expenses or remembering the name of a restaurant I went to last month.
And Strava, an app for workouts, lets me track my bike rides and jogs. A lot of this creates a privacy mess, I know.
What tech tools do you rely on the most for work?
This is least techie answer possible, but aside from email and my phone's voice recorder, it's probably paper. (Sorry, trees, including the one this article will be printed on.) For every big story I do, I print out huge stacks of background reading on the executives and industry. They're good for flights since there's no danger of bad Wi-Fi or no outlets.
When I'm writing a longer story, I print out all my interview notes and spread the pages across my kitchen table (or floor), in the manner of a chef's mise en place. This helps me organize my thoughts before I dive into the writing. I don't understand how people can work off 30 different documents on one tiny laptop screen.
I also find it very comforting to constantly make and remake to-do lists on whatever paper I can find -- old envelopes and junk mail, receipts, notepads shaped like my first initial, Post-its. I leave a trail of these everywhere I go, like the Johnny Appleseed of productivity.
Anything that doesn't contribute to deforestation?
To transcribe interviews, I use Temi, a service that relies on artificial intelligence. The quality is not great, but it is very cheap and gets me over the impossible procrastination hump of not starting the article because I don't want to listen to my own voice. And it presents the messy interview transcript in a way that I can find what I want and easily play it back, sometimes without having to endure any of my stammering.
Like every other reporter, I use Signal and way too much Twitter. I also use some of the data services the venture capitalists use to identify and track up-and-coming start-ups: App Annie, Crunchbase, CB Insights, Pitchbook, LinkedIn.
The most crucial reporting tool I have is probably a gigantic purse that fits my entire life: laptop, tangled masses of chargers and headphones, numerous snacks and water bottles, a dozen pens, a bunch of notebooks, and at least three half-read New Yorkers that have traveled across the country with me so many times they're basically my emotional support animals.
What trends do you see emerging in the start-up scene? Which of them do you think have potential to be successful, and which ones will be a flash in a pan?
Being new to San Francisco (I moved from New York last year), I felt it was important to go full native. I acquired AirPods, downloaded the Mr. Chilly weather app for the city's "microclimates" and briefly embraced scooters. I have not yet bought a vest from the vending machine at San Francisco International Airport, but given the aforementioned microclimates, I see their appeal.
The scooter services rode a wave of hype, and I suspect the severity of the backlash to scooter debris -- and the vandalism -- was greater than the companies and their investors expected. Between injuries, regulatory scrutiny, higher-than-anticipated replacement costs, potential tariffs and the wearing off of the initial novelty, the companies seem to be experiencing a trough of disillusionment just in time for spring.
I stopped riding the scooters because I was spending every scooting second thinking about how this would be an especially embarrassing way for a tech reporter to die. Even imagining myself explaining to strangers that, heavy sigh, yes, these crutches are from a scooter accident was enough to convert me back to a boring old analog bike.
You've written about hustle culture and toil glamour . Is the idea of work-life balance dead?
Unfortunately, a lot of the companies that outwardly promote the concept of work-life balance are the ones with the worst cultures of overwork. Over time, I imagine, hypocrisy will turn people off working at those places. Until then, it's up to the workers to draw their own boundaries.
One way to do that is to understand the difference between taking pride in their work and defining their self-worth by their jobs. And maybe lowering sky-high expectations about their company's do-gooder missions, and being realistic about how fulfilling their jobs will actually be.
Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life?
I have exactly one useful product endorsement: Everyone should abandon the tyranny of bulky, uncomfortable U-shaped neck pillows for the Trtl sleep pillow.
When I covered the tech industry from New York, I traveled to San Francisco all the time, and the Trtl saved me on countless red-eyes. It's basically a plastic neck brace attached to a Velcro scarf. It looks absurd. It easily fits into a purse. It's glorious.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Last month, Caryn Isaacs went to see her primary care doctor for her annual Medicare wellness visit. A patient advocate who lives in Manhattan, Isaacs, 68, felt perfectly fine and expected a clean bill of health.
But her doctor, who had ordered a variety of blood and urine tests, said she had a urinary tract infection and prescribed an antibiotic.
“The nurse said, ‘Can you take Cipro?’ ” Isaacs recalled. “I didn’t have any reason not to, so I said yes.”
There are actually plenty of reasons for older people to avoid Cipro and other antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones, which have prompted warnings from the Food and Drug Administration about their risks of serious side effects.
And there are good reasons to avoid any antibiotic when bacteria are detected in a urine culture in a patient who has no other signs of infection. So-called asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age, but these women are not sick and don’t need drugs, so medical guidelines recommend against routine screening or treatment.
Yet Isaacs’ prescription was hardly unusual. Despite campaigns by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health groups, older Americans still take too many antibiotics.
Patients over age 65 have the highest rate of outpatient prescribing of any age group. A new CDC study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, points out that doctors write enough antibiotic prescriptions annually - nearly 52 million in 2014 - for every older person to get at least one.
Because the researchers used a national pharmacy database that tracked only outpatients, the study probably underestimates the problem. “The volume would be higher if you included hospitals and nursing homes and other long-term-care settings,” said Dr. Katherine Fleming-Dutra, deputy director of the CDC’s office of antibiotic stewardship.
Glass-half-full types might be pleased to see that after climbing 30 percent from 2000 to 2010, antibiotic prescriptions for older adults leveled off from 2011 to 2014. “That’s potentially good news,” said Dr. Sarah Kabbani, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC and lead author of the study.
But what public health advocates want to see is a decline, as has happened with young children, once the group most likely to use antibiotics.
“It’s hard to feel heartened about a plateau when overuse remains so prevalent,” said Dr. Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness. “It’s as perennial as the grass.”
Antibiotic overuse contributes to a serious public health threat by creating drug resistance, as infectious bacteria adapt to the medications. Drugs then lose their effectiveness, forcing doctors to resort to more toxic, less potent, often costlier options. Two million Americans get antibiotic-resistant infections annually, the CDC has reported, and 23,000 die from them.
Moreover, antibiotics interact badly with many of the other drugs older adults take, including such widely used medications as statins, blood thinners, and kidney and heart medications. “The number of potential drug-drug interactions with antibiotics are vast,” Alexander cautioned.
Some antibiotics also have dismaying, even alarming, side effects in themselves. In 2013, the FDA issued a warning about azithromycin, which in rare cases leads to dangerous heart arrhythmias.
But for more than a decade, the agency’s most frequent target has been fluoroquinolones.
It has warned that this class of antibiotics (including Cipro and Levaquin) increases the risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture, particularly in older adults; that it can cause the nerve damage called peripheral neuropathy; and that it can lead to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).
“One of the most common problems for older adults are changes in mental status - getting anxious, getting loopy,” said Dr. Sara Cosgrove, medical director of the Johns Hopkins Hospital’s Adult Antimicrobial Stewardship Program. “These drugs get into the brain.” The FDA also warned of the problem in July.
In fact, the agency advised in 2016 that fluoroquinolones’ potential side effects outweighed their benefits for several common infections. Last year, it added still another warning about ruptures or tears in the aorta, a rare but serious condition for which older people are at greater risk.
Fluoroquinolones are also most implicated in the rampant, difficult-to-cure infection called C. difficile, along with an earlier antibiotic, clindamycin. C. difficile, too, occurs more frequently in older people.
Yet what class of antibiotics did the CDC team determine was most commonly prescribed for older adults? Fluoroquinolones. (The most used single drug was azithromycin, marketed as Zithromax, which isn’t a quinolone.)
More troublingly, doctors often prescribe these medications unnecessarily. Upper respiratory infections - colds, sinus infections, bronchitis - trigger most prescriptions, but these are typically viral, not bacterial, and thus impervious to antibiotics.
Nonetheless, a large 2017 study of older adults in Ontario found that almost half were prescribed antibiotics for nonbacterial upper respiratory infections that would have cleared up without them. “Patients usually get better in spite of the drugs, not because of them,” Alexander said.
As Kabbani pointed out, “when antibiotics are needed, they are lifesaving drugs.” But because they are so widely misused, with resistance such a menace, the CDC has pushed for more prudent practices for consumers and for hospitals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, similarly, is phasing in policies for wiser antibiotic use in nursing homes.
“We want patients to get antibiotics when they need them - the right drug at the right time and the right dose - and not when they don’t,” Fleming-Dutra said. Even when antibiotics prove necessary, she noted, patients may get the wrong ones or take them for too long.
Isaacs didn’t do well on Cipro. She suffered severe chest pain and felt anxious and irritable.
She finished the weeklong course of the drug anyway, and her personality changes have receded, she said. But occasional twinges of chest pain persist, along with a sense of weakness.
She does worry about urinary tract infections; she has seen the delirium they can cause in her older clients. But she may approach the issue differently next time. “I probably would take something,” she said. “But I won’t take Cipro.”

Texto completo: The Apollo Theater's weekly Amateur Night has been an evolving part of Harlem's culture for the past 85 years.
"There aren't many things left in New York City you can say that about," says Marion J. Caffey, producer of the talent showcase at the theater "where stars are born and legends are made."
The Apollo enters its 85th anniversary year hoping to appeal to new fans with a celebratory events lineup, new Amateur Night set design and plans for its first physical expansion since 1934.
"We still see ourselves as a home of black contemporary culture," says Kamilah Forbes, the venue's executive producer. "We want to make sure, especially moving forward, the Apollo is that place in which culture makers are creating, building, dreaming."
Family-friendly events like the upcoming one-man historical play, "Twisted Melodies," and recent ads branding the Apollo as "the best fun you can have in NYC" look to bring in younger fans and tourists. But, it's not the first time the theater, once a haven for locals, has set out to attract new audiences.
A storied past
Sitting in the mezzanine of the 105-year-old theater, Caffey looks out at the stage where aspiring performers have stood most Wednesday nights for decades. Some of the legends who've graced it include James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson and a 17-year-old Ella Fitzgerald.
"She didn't want to sing," Caffey says of Fitzgerald's first Amateur Night performance on Nov. 21, 1934. She put her name in the night's talent drawing on a dare "and wanted to dance, but when her name was drawn, the performer before her had already danced, so she had to do something else."
More recently discovered at the theater is Machine Gun Kelly, who became the first rapper to win Amateur Night in 2009.
The Apollo first introduced its open-mic talent show in 1934. The hourslong show was open to anyone - performers simply entered their names in a drawing to take the stage.
The audience "would throw money on the stage, but that doesn't happen anymore," Caffey says.
At a time when African-American artists were not welcome in NYC's other performance venues, the Apollo's Amateur Night served as an incubator for the growth of soul, R&B, jazz and gospel music in the city.
Amateur Night was already 75 years old when Caffey was tapped to help keep the tradition alive. "There's a lot of pressure coming into something that's lasted so many years," he says, laughing.
When he came on board in 2008, the Apollo was still recovering from a period of financial turmoil. Between 1988 and 1991, the venue recorded a loss of $2 million per year, according to The New York Times. It underwent an interior and exterior restoration 10 years later, which reportedly helped increase sales from 115,000 to 400,000 ticket holders annually.
But it wasn't enough. Amateur Night was still struggling.
The Apollo couldn't compare with the city's larger venues - hosting popular artists - and the production of Amateur Night itself lacked structure and branding appeal. As a New Jersey resident with more than 20 years of Broadway experience, Caffey was tasked with drawing in a new audience.
Spreading "Apollo love"
Facing a gentrifying Harlem, the Apollo needed to look beyond locals to stay afloat, which translated to a still-evolving overhaul of the talent-show tradition.
Acts once picked night-of are now prescreened during private auditions led by Caffey; the program settles neatly into a predictable 90- to 120-minute time slot; and marketing strategies set out to target tourists and brand the show as an iconic "New York night out." Amateur Night has a new stage design, as well as improved lighting and technical production.
"We tell tourists to go visit the Empire State Building ... why not the historic Apollo?" He says. "This is the original talent competition. There's a reason it's been replicated on television" in shows like "American Idol," "The Voice," and even Fox's rebooted "Showtime at the Apollo."
The Amateur Night audience, once primarily African-American, is now as diverse as a walk through midtown. Most ticket holders, Caffey says, come from out of state or even the country, resulting in a mix of cultures working together to pick the city's next rising star.
The night now begins with the "Apollo love" movement, led by "Set It Off Man" Joe Gray, who encourages those of different ethnic backgrounds to hold hands and "spread love."
"In this moment, there are no white people, no black people, no Asian, no Christian, we are all one human race," Caffey says. "For 10 seconds," he continues, "we let down all the politics and it's become a really special moment in the show."
But Amateur Night is still a little rough around the edges. It's known best for its "power of the boo," which Caffey says often surprises tourists who aren't familiar with the tradition.
Amid a growing Amateur Night production, the theater is also planning to open up a new performance space. Steps away from the Apollo, the former Victoria Theater is set to become the new Apollo Performing Arts Center in 2020.
"When we look toward the future, we're looking to push the vision of a performing arts center," says Forbes, adding that the Apollo expansion will help to create "the next producers and designers of color of tomorrow."

Texto completo: Picture your book club. Keep the glasses of Chardonnay and hold the laughs at witty takes level, but increase your attendance 20 fold.
That's what the DSM Book Festival hopes to be.
Hitting Capital Square in downtown Des Moines on Saturday, the DSM Book Festival has scored three heavy-hitting headliners — Susan Orlean, Garth Stein and Nnedi Okorafor — and plans a host of literary-themed discussions and classes.
Now, the Des Moines Storytellers Project is proud to announce that we are joining the book-themed fun with an event featuring beloved tales from our archives.
"From the collection: Treasured stories from the Des Moines Storytellers Project" will bow at 6 p.m. on the Prairie Meadows Authors Pavilion and will feature storytellers revisiting pieces that made our first four seasons sparkle.
At the Storytellers Project, journalists with the Des Moines Register coach everyday Iowans to tell true, first-person stories live onstage without notes.
Like a chat around the campfire or a visit among friends, the Storytellers Project celebrates that good stories don't necessarily have to be bound up in a book — an idea that's also central to the mission of this new festival, said Colleen Murphy, downtown events director with the Greater Des Moines Partnership.
"We will have the authors, but a lot of the festival is centered around discussion and celebrating how people love to share stories or what they've read with each other," she said.
Born from the success of smaller book-focused events, The DSM Book Festival is aimed at connecting readers with people who produce work you can read.
Like all good book clubs, the festival is 50 percent literature discussion and 50 percent party.
"When I read a book, one of the more exciting things I love after I finish is to talk with someone about it," Murphy said. "So this festival is bringing that to life in a community celebration."
For more than a year, a committee of citizens, literary folk and business leaders have been planning the event. Throughout the process, they've made a concerted effort to secure authors whose work has transcended the literary scene, Murphy said.
A staff writer at the New Yorker, Susan Orlean has had multiple books land on the best-seller list, including "The Orchid Thief," which was later made into "Adaptation," a film starring Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. Orlean is appearing at the festival as part of the Des Moines Public Library's Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) event series.
Garth Stein is the author of the perennial book club favorite, "The Art of Racing in the Rain," which will be made into a film this year.
And Nnedi Okorafor wrote some of the Black Panther comics that inspired the 2018 Oscar-nominated eponymous film. An award-winning science fiction author when not writing for panels, Okorafor is known for her Africa-based fantasy and myth-infused magical realism young adult books.
Her Akata series, which centers on a young Nigerian-American girl who discovers she can cast spells, was called a "Nigerian Harry Potter" by the New York Times.
In addition to the author talks, there will be a children's stage for young readers and a host of "make and take classes" featuring book discussions paired with a craft.
On the cooking stage, classes will include the Grape Gatsby, a wine tasting with a 1920s theme, and For Whom the Beer Tolls, a lecture on authors and the drinks they loved.
The Des Moines Storytellers Project is currently in its fourth season and has shows scheduled throughout this year. To become a teller or attend a show, visit DesMoinesRegister.com/Storytellers.
The Des Moines Register is a sponsor of the DSM Book Festival.

Smart Safety Checks for Smart Robots

Texto completo: Hi. I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
Machines are more than ever controlled by software, not humans. Occasionally it goes fatally wrong.
On March 10, 157 people died when an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed. Five months earlier, another crash of the same model of airplane killed 189 people. There are indications that software intended to prevent the jets from stalling may have played a role in both accidents.
Reporting by The New York Times suggests that the software didn't receive a detailed review by the Federal Aviation Administration before it entered use: Under new rules, the agency delegated much of the responsibility to Boeing. If the software was at fault, and the problem did slip through the regulatory net, it raises questions about how safety-critical technology is vetted.
Those questions will become more important over the next few years.
A year ago, an Arizona woman was struck and killed by one of Uber's autonomous cars. The vehicle's autonomy systems failed to brake, as did the safety driver behind the wheel.
Companies like Uber and Waymo, along with most of the auto industry, expect autonomous cars to proliferate over the next decade. Such advances aren't limited to cars -- they will further automate everything from air travel to food delivery. They are built on technologies, like artificial intelligence, that will make split-second decisions for humans.
The Boeing software was designed to perform a simple task: Nudge the airplane's nose down based on sensor readings if a stall was anticipated. As harder tasks are handed to software, the stakes rise.
"As you create more advanced A.I. systems, the harm that can result from them failing can be really large," said Jade Leung, a researcher at Oxford University's Center for the Governance of Artificial Intelligence.
But increasing the complexity of systems makes checking them more difficult. Hardware, from chips to special sensors, can be difficult to test. And it can be difficult for humans to understand how some A.I. algorithms make decisions.
Ms. Leung said regulators needed to be more aware of tail-end risks -- the highly unlikely but catastrophic events that could occur if something malfunctioned. That might mean introducing more conservative rules that relax as technology matures, ideally developed in tandem with technologists who understand deeply how the systems work.
"Verifying the performance and safety of software is a really, really hard technical challenge," Ms. Leung said. Nonetheless, it's a challenge that has to be addressed.
Big Tech's new hustle: Cloud gaming
When a company spends billions on world-leading digital infrastructure, it naturally wants to wring every last cent of revenue out of it. That's partly what is driving Google's new Stadia gaming service, announced on Tuesday.
Google's pitch is straightforward: Think of it as Netflix for gaming. As long as they have a fast internet connection, users can pay a subscription to play high-definition games, akin to what they'd find on current top-end consoles, on any computer, phone or tablet.
The company's promise: that its cloud infrastructure makes that achievable. It will add racks of gaming-specific chips to existing server farms to essentially give people an on-demand, remote gaming computer. And Google officials believe that since most users are now so close to its pervasive hardware, lag won't be a problem -- an issue that held back earlier game streaming platforms, like the now-defunct OnLive.
Google is not alone in the push into what some people see as the future of gaming. Microsoft had already announced that it planned to offer a trial of a similar service for Xbox consoles, computers and mobile devices this year. Amazon, which owns the game-watching service Twitch, is widely believed to be planning something similar, built on its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure.
Those three companies happen to be the world's largest cloud providers. It's not surprising that they're enamored of the idea of taking a slice of the $135 billion gaming industry, when all it could take is the flex of an existing muscle.
The U.S. struggles to supercompute
About $500 million should buy a lot of computer. This past week, we found out how much. Writing for The Times, Don Clark explained what the Department of Energy would get for dropping that sum on a supercomputer:
Lab officials predict it will be the first American machine to reach a milestone called "exascale" performance, surpassing a quintillion calculations per second. That's roughly seven times the speed rating of the most powerful system built to date.
The device, called Aurora, will be used to figure out everything from how drugs work to the impact of climate change. It's also a useful indicator of the nation's competitiveness in science and technology -- or, at this point, whether it's leading or lagging behind China. On that front, Mr. Clark reports that it has been a mixed bag for the United States:
An IBM system called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, took back the No. 1 position last year on a twice-yearly ranking of the world's 500 most powerful systems -- a spot held by China for five years. But China leads by another key measure: It accounted for 227 systems on the Top 500 list, compared with 109 for the United States.
China is expected to have its own exascale supercomputer running as soon as 2020 -- a full year before Aurora boots up.
And some stories you shouldn't miss
Google received its third antitrust fine from the European Union since 2017. This one, for 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, was for imposing unfair terms on the search service it offers to other websites.
Facebook will stop targeting some of its ads. It will no longer allow advertising of housing, jobs or credit to be aimed at those of a certain race, gender or age group.
The Pentagon's giant cloud contract has a one-man holdup. Deap Ubhi, a little-known entrepreneur, is at the center of a legal battle between Amazon and Oracle over the $10 billion project.
Take a look at an early iPhone prototype. It's red, about the size of an old computer motherboard and helped engineers to program the first breakthrough smartphone.
A.I. researchers could give computers a little more credit. Rich Sutton, a pioneer of some of today's most effective A.I. techniques, argues that a "bitter lesson" in artificial intelligence is that "the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation."
Why is there still relatively little tech regulation? "Lawmakers are reluctant to disrupt the enormous wealth creation machine that technology has turned out to be," according to the security expert Bruce Schneier.
Screen sharing can be an easy route to professional humiliation. But don't worry, the aftermath usually isn't as bad as you might think. (Even so, here are some tips for avoiding future catastrophes.)

Texto completo: Curtain up and light the lights: Apple’s almost certain to be star-studded press gathering is now but hours away.
Here’s what you’re likely to hear once Tim Cook takes the stage, and how to tune in if you aren’t a member of the media or one of the invited guests sitting in the audience at the Steve Jobs Theater at the company’s Apple Park campus.
Where To Watch
Apple will be livestreaming the event at its website. It’s also fitting, given the expected news of the day, that you’ll also be able to watch on your big screen television you’ve connected an Apple TV set-top box. Download the Apple Events app from the App Store on the Apple TV device.
When does the event start?
The festivities are scheduled to begin at 1 p. m. ET. Broadway shows typically start five minutes after the announced curtain time; movies only start after you've been treated to a strong of trailers. Apple press events typically start on time.
What will we hear?
Unless all the pre-event chatter has been way off base—and there’s no reason to believe that it has been—Apple is almost certainly going to showcase its answer to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime video, with an entertainment-based video streaming service of its own. Likely base cost for consumers, $9. 99 a month, with extra fees for premium content from HBO and Showtime.
Subscription overload: News, entertainment, music, iCloud—are you ready to spend $40 monthly with Apple?
Robocalls: Robocalls: AT&T CEO gets spam call alert on his Apple Watch during a live interview
At the same time, though, Apple is also expected to announce some kind of news and magazine service, featuring such publications--again if the pre-launch rumors prove accurate-as the Wall Street Journal and People Magazine. Unknown are the state of other big-time properties, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and yes, USA TODAY.
Still to be answered: How will Apple package the new services and, for that matter, bring the existing Apple Music service into the fold?
And when do all the new services actually get going?
What kind of original content might we see?
Aside from Apple’s earliest efforts in TV content—versions of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” and a reality show “Planet of the Apps”—it is premature to weigh in on the quality of the shows that are likely to appear on Apple’s service.
We do know the quality of the Hollywood types Apple is working with and the roster includes some of the biggest names in showbiz: including Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, J. J. Abrams, Jennifer Garner, M. Night Shyamalan, even Sesame Workshop. It's a good bet you'll see Cupertino cameos from some or all of the above.
What we also know is that the company is parting with some of its riches to propel the launch of the new services, to the tune of at least $1 billion.
Is Apple going to unveil new hardware?
This seems like an unlikely prospect, except perhaps a freshened up version of the Apple TV box. Apple pretty much cleared the decks for new physical products last week having unveiled in successive days new versions of the iPad mini and iPad Air tablets, iMac desktop computers, and AirPods wireless headphones.
What we may see, however, is a new Apple credit card.

Resumen: On May 21, 1919, the U.S. House of Representatives passed and sent to the Senate the constitutional amendment for women's suffrage. Mann's mastery of the intricacies of legislation allowed him to attach his name to two major proposals -- the Mann-Elkins Act that amended the Interstate Commerce Act of 1897 and the Mann Act, which outlawed the interstate transportation of women for prostitution. "The time is ripe, the people are ready and the beneficiaries of this amendment are eager, willing and able to perform the duties of citizenship," said Mann, who as a leader and a member of the committee on suffrage led the floor debate on the amendment.

Texto completo: A University of Illinois graduate born in McLean County had a small but significant role 100 years ago in finally setting in motion the process by which American women got the right to vote.
On May 21, 1919, the U.S. House of Representatives passed and sent to the Senate the constitutional amendment for women's suffrage. The man who chaired the House Woman Suffrage Committee and led the fight on the House floor was Rep. James R. Mann, R-Chicago.
Mann had been born on a farm near Bloomington in 1856. He was class valedictorian at the University of Illinois in 1876 (then just nine years old and still known as the Illinois Industrial University). Five years later, he graduated from the Union College of Law in Chicago (which in 1891 became the Northwestern University School of Law). His wife, the former Emma Columbia, was from Champaign.
Mann settled in Hyde Park, then a large village south of Chicago. It soon became part of the city of Chicago, and Mann was its first alderman (1892). He went directly from the Chicago City Council to congressman in the 1896 election and remained there until his death in November 1922.
Mann was known as an extraordinary legislator who spent hours studying the details of nearly every piece of legislation that advanced beyond the passage stage, according to a 1953 article in the Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society.
"He remained constantly on the floor when actual business was under way (he took no lunch), and was never far distant during general debate," wrote L. Ethan Ellis.
Mann's mastery of the intricacies of legislation allowed him to attach his name to two major proposals -- the Mann-Elkins Act that amended the Interstate Commerce Act of 1897 and the Mann Act, which outlawed the interstate transportation of women for prostitution. He also was a leader on other issues, including taxes and tariffs, and was a rare opponent both of Prohibition and the United States' entry into World War I.
During Mann's best years in Congress he had been mentioned both as a possible speaker of the House and as a presidential candidate, although neither campaign went far.
The few biographies or journal articles about him gloss over Mann's involvement in the effort to give women the right to vote. But nearly all contemporary newspaper articles noted his critical role.
"Mann Leads in Fight to Put Suffrage Measure Over," said the headline in Springfield's Illinois State Register.
Other accounts called the proposed amendment the Susan B. Anthony resolution and even the "Equal Rights Amendment" (Illinois State Journal). Although some newspapers carried only small stories about the House vote -- it wasn't the first time the amendment had passed the House, the Senate was always the obstacle -- The New York Times had a full account.
The measure passed 304-89, primarily on the strength of Republicans who at that time were the more progressive political party in the United States. Two hundred Republicans voted yes along with 102 Democrats. Opponents included 19 Republicans and 70 Democrats. Among the supporters were local congressmen William McKinley of Champaign, Joseph Cannon of Danville, Edwin Brooks of Newton and Frank Smith of Dwight; all of them, like Mann, were Republicans.
"The time is ripe, the people are ready and the beneficiaries of this amendment are eager, willing and able to perform the duties of citizenship," said Mann, who as a leader and a member of the committee on suffrage led the floor debate on the amendment.
He shrewdly made note of the long-standing Republican support for suffrage, while saying it wasn't a partisan issue.
"It is true that the president and Democrat leaders have frequently talked in favor of woman suffrage but a majority of them have never voted for it," he said in floor debate. "Some of them have been long on promises but short on fulfillment, as they are on everything else. But this is not a partisan question and I hope that partisanship will be kept out of it and each member on each side will vote with a full sense of his responsibility. The amendment is in line with progress. Women will receive the suffrage and will take their share on the management of government."
The Senate, after four previously unsuccessful tries, finally approved the amendment on June 4 (with the votes of 37 Republicans and 19 Democrats) and sent it to the states for ratification. Within about 14 months that was accomplished with Tennessee ratifying the 19th amendment.
James Mann, who was in poor health for many of his final years in the House -- he suffered from depression and frequent chest pains -- died in December 1922 at the age of 66. He was still a member of Congress.
The New York Times gave Mann a rare honor, an editorial salute upon his passing. It didn't mention his role in granting women the right to vote.
"He came to have a strong hand in all legislation; and it is unfortunate that his name is associated only with an act of federal moral regulation, however praiseworthy its purpose," said the Times. "Mr. Mann's course with regard to American relations with Germany before the war was regrettable but it should be remembered to his honor that he was a friend of preparedness. His great distinction was his perfect mastery of all the business of the House and of parliamentary procedure. He had enormous industry."

Gillum launches drive to register 1 million voters

Texto completo: THE BUZZ ON FLORIDA POLITICS

Andrew Gillum is launching a campaign that could change the dynamics of the 2020 election  even if he didnt announce a plan to run for president.

At a Wednesday rally at Florida Memorial Universitys Miami Gardens campus, Gillum rolled out an ambitious initiative to register one million new voters ahead of the presidential election. The Florida Democratic Party that its also spending $2 million to register 200,000 new voters.

Im tapping into that network  what we built from the campaign, the enthusiasm, the volunteers, the infrastructure, the assets there  and trying to turn all of that energy and effort into registering and engaging one million voters in advance of the 2020 election, the 39-year-old former Tallahassee mayor and past gubernatorial candidate told the Miami Herald.

Florida Democrats hope to reinforce a slipping voter advantage in a crucial swing state that voted for Donald Trump two years ago after twice casting its vote for Barack Obama.

Over the 10 years from the time Obama was first elected in 2008 to the November midterms, Florida Democrats saw a 700,000-voter lead over Republicans dwindle to roughly 260,000.

And that lead didnt hold up when it came to voter participation in the fall when, despite Democratic gains around the country, Republican voters turned out in greater numbers than Democrats and propelled Ron DeSantis to a win of less than half a percentage point over Gillum.

So, after receiving plenty of help courting new voters during his campaign from registration-minded political organizations like Tom Steyers NextGen America, Gillum said he hopes to build on the enthusiasm that resulted in a roughly 33 percent statewide turnout increase over the 2014 midterms.

At the same time, he also wants to do more to reach out to unlikely and unregistered voters around the state, but particularly in places like South Florida, where some party activists felt that the Democratic Party did too little to court Hispanic and black voters in the past election.

To me, its absolutely critical, not just to this election cycle but to the future of politics in the state of Florida, to get back into the business of engaging people where they live, talking to them outside the election and being in contact with them, Gillum said. So when we do reach out to them for their vote theyre not saying, Its been a long time and I havent talked to you. Why should we believe in you? 

Miami-Dade County was among the regions where turnout among Democratic voters was low compared to the rest of the state, one of the key reasons Gillum lost the race. He said South Florida remains one of the most important areas for connecting with unregistered and disenfranchised voters.

From a numbers perspective, South Florida is where a heavy percentage of these new voters are going to come from. The population there is one that I think is critical for us when we consider communities largely left out or left behind, he said.

Gillum says the effort wont be entirely partisan, but he plans to work in conjunction with the Florida Democratic Party and left-leaning organizations like New Florida Majority and Florida Immigration Coalition. In announcing their own effort Wednesday, Florida Democrats said there are more than 4 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state, and the party will be partnering with data science firms and building out infrastructure to grow the ranks of registered Democrats.

Gillum declined in an interview to explicitly say that he isnt going to run for the partys nomination in 2020, although he indicated in a New York Times interview that hes closed that door.

Hurricane a disaster for Florida prisons

After Hurricane Michael hit the Panhandle, a key portion of the states corrections system was crippled, leaving nearly 300 prison employees displaced and more than 5,000 relocated inmates packing facilities across Florida.

New figures obtained by the News Service of Florida show a significant problem in a region where a sizable part of the workforce is employed by the corrections system and a good chunk of the states inmate population is housed.

It has taken months to know exactly how bad the Oct. 10 storm has impacted the regions 23 prisons. But officials with the Florida Department of Corrections said last week that in addition to tens of millions of dollars in damage to facilities, the storm also displaced 284 prison employees, increased job vacancies and forced shifting 5,000 inmates to facilities across the state.

Nearly 800 prison employees who lost or sustained severe damage to their homes in the storm have received a total of $450,000 in assistance from the Corrections Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to aid the Department of Corrections.

The department is also struggling to fill vacancies in the hurricane-impacted areas. Before the hurricane hit, the regions 23 prisons had a vacancy rate of 12 percent. As of Feb. 22, that vacancy rate had ticked up to 14 percent, with vacancies for prison guards and probation officers.

Michael Van Sickler and Amy Hollyfield contributed to this report, which also uses information from the News Service of Florida.

Lowry coach seeks changes

Texto completo: Ed Partee had the worst Thanksgiving of his life last year.
Partee, the girls soccer coach at Lowry High School in Winnemucca, could not chew solid food for seven weeks after a parent punched him in the face at a game last fall.
In the wake of the incident, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association is taking another look at efforts to add consequences for bad parent behavior.
Partee said the father of an Incline player charged onto the field and confronted him after his daughter took a hard hit during the game.
Partee said his players told him the father was being abusive toward the Lowry goalkeeper and other players. Partee told him he could not talk to the players in that manner.
The man then punched Partee in the jaw, breaking it. The Incline police and an ambulance were called to the game.
An investigation showed Partee might have also pushed the man, identified in court records as Paul Heffern.
Partee and Heffern filed charges against each other, both of which were later dropped due to an incomplete investigation. Partee has a civil suit pending against Heffern.
"You can't have this happening," Partee said. "This isn't going away. This is not 30 years ago; people are crazy now. That's the scary part. They need to come up with something."
Heffern declined requests for comment.
Donnie Nelson, assistant director of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association, said there are no regulations concerning parent behavior.
But that could change.
The NIAA board of control will discuss the matter again at its March meeting. Currently, the NIAA does not have any rules or power to penalize schools because of parents' or fans' behavior.
Partee spoke in front of the NIAA board of control at its December meeting.
"The board had a very long discussion on this during the last meeting and is looking to enact legislation granting the NIAA authorization to take action accordingly against fans as well, should that be deemed necessary," Nelson said.
Rollins Stallworth, Washoe County School District's coordinator of activities and athletics, said it is difficult to prevent incidents like Partee's because most schools do not have the necessary police force to control upset or disgruntled parents. Stallworth is also on the NIAA board of directors.
Stallworth said it is up to each school to have an administrator at every activity to help prevent such situations.
"We would hope that these types of behaviors would never escalate to the level of physical contact," Stallworth said. "Being proactive and establishing guidelines for expected coaches and parent behaviors, facility barriers that separate those involved and a consequence that would deter such behavior is the goal of the WCSD."
He said having more fencing around athletic fields is one possible solution.
Stallworth said there are two sides to the story, but there is no video of the assault. He said Partee admits to touching the parent, but only to separate him from the players.
Heffern said Partee pushed him.
Stallworth said the school district's role is to prevent such assaults from happening in the future. One possibility is to have administrators walking around the field or track.
When Incline played at Lowry later in the season, school officials had extra police at that game.
Charges against both parties have been dropped, for now, until the Washoe County Sheriff's office investigates the case further.
Incline High principal Andrew Yoxsimer said the school plans to have meetings with all parents about sportsmanship.
Yoxsimer said he has spoken with Heffern and he is confident a similar incident will not happen again.
"Our No. 1 concern is for the safety of athletes and parents and everybody involved," Yoxsimer said. "He is a very reasonable man and I have no concerns about his behavior in future games."
Yoxsimer said signage will be put up directing spectators to not go on the field.
Stallworth is on the NIAA sportsmanship committee, which is trying to address bad behavior with possible consequences or penalties for bad sportsmanship among players, parents and coaches.
He said officials are responsible for what happens on the field or court, and school administrators are responsible for everything else outside of those areas at athletic events.
He said having the PA announcer remind fans about proper behavior is one way to reduce incidents. He said having clearly marked and separated seating sections with visible security will help.
At halftime, security will move to concession areas and officials will be escorted on and off the field or court.
Social media consequences These types of incidents occur nationwide, and one official in Oklahoma has created a Facebook page, 'Offside,' dedicated to capturing unruly parents at youth games on video.
The page was created by Brian Barlow, who told the New York Times that he offers a $100 bounty for each clip in order to shame the rising tide of unruly parents and spectators at youth sports events.
"I do it to hold people accountable — to identify and call out the small percentage of parents who nonetheless create a toxic environment at youth sports," Barlow, 44, told the Times. "It's a very visual deterrent, and not just to the person caught on video but to others who ask themselves: Do I look like that jerk?"
Michelle Bays, the chief investigator/public information officer for the Washoe County District Attorney's office, said the Incline case has been dismissed and returned to the Washoe County Sheriff's office to investigate further.
"We filed a dismissal memo on both citations in Incline Justice court on Jan 23rd based on an inability to prove either one, primarily because both were charged with the same offense arising out of the same incident bringing in self-defense issues. We have informed the SO (sheriff's office) and they have the option of investigating further if additional evidence might be found to support our re-filing but have not heard about this," Bays wrote in an email to the RGJ.

Texto completo: It is always a pleasure to attend plays at the Pearl McManus Theater in the historic Palm Springs Women's club.
Opening night for the Dezart Performs production of "White Guy on the Bus" offered a story of a wealthy white businessman who rides the same bus every day and befriends a single black mother. Some of the dialogue created laughter and some made the audience think, feel and sometime squirm in their seats. Tensions arose between the two, exposing life style differences which created a lack of understanding and respect - a problem that continues to exist in the world today.
The characters, played by accomplished actors Sean Timothy Brown, Desiree Clarke, Bianca Stoker, Alexana Thomas and David Youse led the audience to believe that they didn't discriminate but that proved to be untrue. The New York Times describes the production as "A scalding take on race."
We have come a long way from the 50's when many cities, North and South, had ghettoized neighborhoods, not only for blacks, but also for Jews, Hispanics, Italians, Irish Catholics and Asians; examples of this are still seen today in many large American cities. Often it was railroad train-tracks that divided the "desirable" neighborhoods from the "ethnic" ones. Many Americans remember how daring it was for their parents to move the family into a neighborhood thought to be exclusively WASP. The homeless were called "hoboes" and "bums." Ethnic slurs, in jokes and conversation, were not viewed as being offensive as they are today. Perhaps we need to pat ourselves on the back because we have improved, but we have a lot farther to go.
A reception with food and beverages followed in the court yard where guests mingled with the actors and discussed ways to alleviate the race problem. Artistic Director Michael Shaw said," I think people are afraid to talk about the problem and are afraid to ask the hard questions." One gentleman suggested that each person must examine their thoughts and begin a dialogue with others in order to build a better understanding and respect between people.
Special guests included Ludim Camacho, Barbara and Jerry Keller, Joyce Bulifant, and Greg Smith and James Geier.
Dezart Performs wishes to thank their generous sponsors: Riviera Palm Springs, Eight4Nine, Desert Care, Acqua, Lulu, Everything Under The Sun, Trio, Hotel Zoso, Devon Self Storage and David A Lee.
The final show of the season "Maytag Virgin" will be from April 5-14. It is a love story set in Alabama about two teachers. The performances are held on Fridays and Saturdays at 7:30 and Sundays at 2:00 pm.

Texto completo: On a sunny March afternoon in 1966, a crowd of students from Park School (now Park Tudor School) in Indianapolis – sporting Roman-like togas and handmade helmets – gathered at the Cold Spring Road campus to witness an event like no other: the launching of a boulder from a catapult.
Cameras from "NBC Nightly News" were rolling; newspaper photographers were at the ready. While a band from nearby Marian College played, the school's Latin students loaded the Mars 1 bow-powered catapult with a 100-pound rock.
The countdown for launch began: Tribus, Duo, Unus ...
The catapult let loose and the rock landed 97 yards short of the goal of 100 yards. "Plop" as the former Park School Latin teacher Bernard Barcio describes it.
The silence from the crowd was deafening until a single laugh prompted an eruption of laughter. "It was a total disaster, but we had a goal and decided to work on it and tweak it," Barcio said.
During a recent interview, Barcio was dressed in a grey sweatshirt with the words, "Si hoc legere scis nimium eruditionis habes," or "If you can read this, you have too much erudition."
Barcio, who also taught in Wayne Township and at Carmel High School, is referred to by his former students as Magnus Magister or "the great teacher." He also happens to be the father-in-law of vice president Mike Pence, who married his stepdaughter, Karen.
Officials of the Park School had tasked the then-28-year-old Barcio with finding creative ways to teach.
"The educational rationale behind this is contextual orientation. If you study Spanish, you can go to Mexico or Spain and you can see the context in which the language is being used. For ancient Latin, the context doesn't exist anymore and for an effective Latin teacher, you've got to help re-create the context in which it was used," Barcio said.
The beginning Student David Leve came up with the idea of a building a catapult. With no workable blueprints for weapons of siege warfare, the students studied small models and photos.
And so, in the middle of winter, the Mars 1 catapult was built in a sub-basement of the school, using hand tools, drills and axes.
"These things weren't engineered off-site and brought in. We ran to the hardware store five times a week buying bolts and lumber," noted former competitor Lee Alig.
When NBC got wind of the program, they pressed Barcio for a date for the launch.
"I decided on the Ides of March," Barcio said. "March 15, it's a good Roman date."
Park School issued a challenge to the legions of Culver Military Academy in northern Indiana to participate in interscholastic competition in 1970. Park students re-enacted the slaying of Julius Caesar on his way back to the Forum and Culver's Black Horse Troop demonstrated Roman riding – by standing atop their horses.
The National Catapult Contest begins Barcio left Park School to teach Latin at North Central High School and by 1972, the first National Catapult Contest was held at Culver Military Academy in Culver.
Park, North Central and Culver, along with several Indiana, Wisconsin and Connecticut high schools, brought their catapults for the competition, which received nationwide coverage from NBC News, The New York Times and Sports Illustrated.
What started as a challenge sparked the imaginations of students around the country and amateur catapult builders locally. It seemed as though the catapult bug had caught on throughout Indianapolis.
"There were stories of five-pound bags of flour flying into people's backyards. Everyone was building catapults," Barcio laughed.
Park student David Dortch, who studied Spanish, not Latin, entered as an independent and won the contest multiple years.
"We were flying by the seat of our pants," he now admits.
His reward for winning was a trip to New York City to appear on the syndicated NBC program, "To Tell the Truth." "I'm 17-year-old in the Plaza Hotel with my Mom drinking a carafe of wine and taking a carriage ride around Central Park," he laughs. Dortch believes his life has come full circle: from building catapults back then to working in the hardware department of a Lowe's in Colorado.
When the Pentagon calls, you answer While at North Central, Barcio even received a call from the Pentagon.
"The Viet Cong are using catapults and they're catapulting logs up into the air and fouling the propellers of our helicopters and we need a crash course in how catapults work. Can we work with you?" the Pentagon told Barcio. "We will provide you with men, equipment and trucks. The Army is joining you."
"They worked with the kids, as they designed the catapults and hauled them to competitions," Barcio said.
It took North Central students three years to perfect their four-story, counter-weight or trebuchet catapult named the Zephyrus.
The hard work paid off.
In 1976, as senior Mary Hyde loaded a 100-pound rock, all eyes were on the projectile as it arced across a field and landed 576 feet away.
It was a world record!
"I think more important to me than the sweetness of victory or the excitement of national publicity was the lesson Zephyrus taught me about life. The only way to reach the stars – any dream or goal you have – is by passing through difficulties," said Mary Hyde Hood, who to this day credits her team and her father for the victory.
After graduation from Earlham College, she taught Latin at Arlington and Howe high schools.
Barcio founded Pompeiiana to sponsor the national competition when schools became concerned about the liability. Guinness World Records wanted no part of it, either.
"Basically, you're building war weapons," Barcio said.
The final contest was held in 1977, but the competitors still stay in touch and created the YouTube documentary, "Support Your Local Catapult," based on the competition.
"It grew beyond us and Culver and quite a network across the country, and it was very exciting to see it grow," Alig said.
"It was a moment in time and all in the name of Latin, and that was the common denominator for everybody competing."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Attorney General William P. Barr and his team on Saturday pored over the highly anticipated report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, a senior Justice Department official said, preparing to deliver the investigation's "principal conclusions" to jittery lawmakers and President Trump as soon as Sunday.
Mr. Barr and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller and oversaw much of his work, were cloistered inside the Justice Department debating how to present the findings. Mr. Mueller was not participating in the process, the official said.
With little concrete information about the investigation circulating outside that tight circle, Washington was rife with speculation bouncing among reporters, lawmakers scattered across the country for their spring recess and lawyers for people involved in the case.
Mr. Trump himself remained uncharacteristically silent. After months attacking Mr. Mueller's inquiry as a partisan "witch hunt," he had yet to comment on its conclusion by Saturday afternoon. Spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump was surrounded by members of his family and a larger coterie of aides than usual. He spent much of Saturday on the golf course and had lunch with Kid Rock, according to people familiar with his plans.
Mr. Mueller delivered his report to Mr. Barr on Friday, signaling the end to a 22-month investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and any attempts by Mr. Trump's associates to aid them. Mr. Mueller also examined whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice to try to protect himself or his allies from investigators.
As part of the winding down of his investigation, Mr. Mueller's office was handing off one of its remaining cases, a spokesman said on Saturday. Prosecutors in the United States attorney's office in the District of Columbia will handle the sentencing of Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign deputy who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to investigators and agreed to cooperate with the inquiry.
Regulations governing the special counsel give Mr. Barr latitude to decide what, if anything, to share publicly. In a letter to Congress notifying lawmakers that he had the report, Mr. Barr said he planned to hand over to them, and by extension the public, a summary of Mr. Mueller's "principal conclusions" as soon as this weekend. He wrote that he "remained committed to as much transparency as possible."
Only a few people in the Justice Department had seen the report and a copy had not been given to the White House, said the senior law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.
The Justice Department appears to be moving quickly, at least in part because it has known for some time that Mr. Mueller was in the homestretch.
When Mr. Barr was briefed on the investigation this month, he was told that there would be no more subpoenas or indictments, and that Mr. Mueller's team was ready to wrap up in mid-March, according to people familiar with the investigation who were not authorized to discuss it. The special counsel's office later notified Mr. Barr that it needed a few additional days to take care of administrative issues, which pushed the delivery to Friday.
Without certainty about what Mr. Barr would disclose or when, House Democrats convened a 30-minute conference call on Saturday afternoon to line up talking points. Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have begun insisting that only the release of Mr. Mueller's full report and underlying findings will be sufficient so that Democrat-led House committees can conduct their own scrutiny of Mr. Trump.
The top Democrats on nearly a dozen House and Senate committees sent letters on Friday to the F.B.I., the Justice Department, the White House and other federal agencies demanding that all documents, communication and evidence amassed by Mr. Mueller and his team be preserved because Congress might request access to it.
"Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents so that the committees can proceed with their independent work, including oversight and legislating to address any issues the Mueller report may raise," Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats before the call.
During the call, she added that she would reject any offer from the Justice Department to brief the bipartisan Gang of Eight House and Senate leaders or some other configuration of lawmakers in a classified setting on findings that are not made public, according to a person present. Ms. Pelosi said she would insist any briefing be unclassified to allow lawmakers to discuss the full investigative findings publicly.
Republican leaders convened their own brief call on Friday night, after the Justice Department notified Congress that it had received the report from Mr. Mueller's office, but it was primarily limited to logistics, according to one person with knowledge of the call. Welcoming the news that the special counsel would seek no further indictments, members of the president's party were cautiously optimistic.
The Republican National Committee circulated talking points to allies on Friday that emphasized Mr. Trump's cooperation with the inquiry and appeared to set the stage for the president and his party to claim political victory. They asserted that "speculation" about interference with the investigation had been proved "dead wrong."
"It's long past time Democrats drop their politically motivated calls for never-ending investigations," said a copy of the talking points, obtained by The New York Times.
Allies surrounding the president at Mar-a-Lago found themselves in a similar place. Mr. Trump's lawyers and aides urged him to stay quiet, people briefed on the discussions said. Wait and see what was in the report, and trust that Mr. Barr is not trying to harm you, they cautioned. They assured him that there would be ample time to claim vindication after they knew what was in the report, the people said.
Mr. Trump appeared to be in good spirits on Friday night when he dined on the Mar-a-Lago patio with his wife and some of his children.
But he was circumspect about the end of an investigation that has been a backdrop of his presidency. He told people who greeted him that he was tired, but he still returned to the patio after giving brief remarks at a local Republican Party dinner in the club's ballroom. He sat sipping coffee until fairly late in the evening.
One friend of Mr. Trump said that despite his outward good spirits, the president remained anxious about the contents of the report and was concerned that its release was taking longer than he expected.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been canvassing friends and allies for their opinions of Mr. Barr, a long-serving Republican legal hand who was confirmed last month. Mr. Trump, people who have spoken with him said, does not know Mr. Barr well or what to expect from him.
"Do you know Barr?" the president has asked others of his attorney general.

Texto completo: The Books & Books flagship store in Coral Gables, Fla., encourages lingering.
It's not just the historic setting (the building dates to 1927), the walls of reading material or the sun-drenched courtyard and cafe. There's also a warmth and satisfaction in all that it represents. That's the vision Mitchell Kaplan had in 1982 when he first opened the doors to what was a much smaller operation back then.
Thirty-seven years, an international book fair and eight additional locations later, Kaplan is celebrated as the man who turned Miami into a book town, and one of the foremost literary centers in the world, starting at a time when nobody took it seriously.
"I came of age on South Beach in the late '60s, when Miami was seen as a fairly irrelevant place," Kaplan said. Authors were his heroes: "To me, being a writer was always the highest calling one could have."
College in Boulder, Colo., was his first true immersion in literary culture. In addition to reading the various literary movements of the 20th century, he learned that behind the writers were intrepid and comparatively unsung booksellers -- Sylvia Beach of Shakespeare and Company, Frances Steloff of Gotham Book Mart, Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights -- without whom there would be no movement.
After a stint in law school in Washington, D.C., he returned to Miami in 1979, where he finished his master's degree in education, taught high school and worked part time in a chain bookstore until he saved enough money to open his own.
His timing was less than auspicious. In 1982, "Miami had just come off one of the most tumultuous periods any city has ever experienced," Kaplan recalled. The combination of the Mariel boatlift, the McDuffie riots and the city's violent drug culture had journalists sounding the death knell. Indeed, a publisher's notion of Miami literature didn't amount to much more than drug dramas and diet guides.
Fortunately, most of the decisions Kaplan has made in his career have been instinctual. He simply wanted a bookstore with what he called the right sensibility, and Miami turned out to be the place that needed it most. Amid all the turmoil, he said, there was also an excitement reverberating through the city. The dials had been reset.
"I knew that there was a sophistication here that nobody gave Miami credit for, because I witnessed what people were reading," he said.
After convincing publishers in New York to send writers, he started a reading series in the store. In 1984, he and Eduardo J. Padrón, now the president of Miami Dade College, co-founded the Miami Book Fair, which has since grown from a one-week affair into an organization that sponsors events throughout the year, drawing hundreds of thousands of participants. Writers like Isaac Singer, James Baldwin, Hunter S. Thompson and Toni Morrison came for readings early on and drew huge crowds. In the late 1980s Kaplan expanded the Coral Gables store, then opened his second on Miami Beach, down the road from where he grew up.
All the while Miami's immigrant populations were expanding. As the readers and writers grew more diverse, so did Kaplan's bookshelves, which are curated by a staff whose members are deeply rooted in this city. Voices and narratives that had long been overlooked found communion in the bookshop.
Kaplan had a front-row seat as Miami rehabilitated and reinvented itself. "In the psyche of the world, Miami became more relevant. I was able to be a small part of that," he said, with characteristic modesty.
Today he has seven stores in the Miami area, with another in Grand Cayman and one in Key West operated by the beloved children's author Judy Blume and her husband, George Cooper.
These are challenging times for indie booksellers, and Kaplan has trod a circuitous path to success. He's opened cafes, co-founded a production company with the filmmaker Paula Mazur and started a podcast. There have been years of work, some luck and a lot of promotion involved, all for the sake of sustaining literary culture, which is something that this community values far more than free two-day shipping.
"It's a small tribe we belong to; we have to do all we can to foster it," he said. "And also to discover what has been ignored."
Standing in front of a wall in the cafe covered with photos of the writers who have visited the bookstore over the years -- just a sampling of thousands Kaplan has brought to this city -- he shared a quotation he heard the poet Ocean Vuong deliver this year at a booksellers conference. It seems to crystallize Kaplan's entire career:
"In a bookstore, you get a human being who is also a mapmaker of possibility. As booksellers, you are practicing, to my mind, one of our species' oldest arts, the art of fostering, sharing and shepherding our most vital stories into the future."

Texto completo: As the opening for "The Country House" at Melbourne Civic Theatre approached, Peg Girard had every reason to be less than chipper.
St. Patrick's Day was coming, and with it, crowds in the streets of downtown Melbourne and cars in the spaces MCT's people would otherwise have to themselves, sparse as they are under normal circumstances. Behind-the-scenes drama continued at Melbourne's other community theater, the Henegar Center, now allied to Titusville Playhouse, around the corner. Construction projects have begun, or are about to begin, downtown, with yet more effect on parking and access for would-be playgoers.
Yet Girard was cheery and gracious as ever, returned a call moments after a message was left and was entirely thrilled about the prospects for the presentation of Donald Margulies' play about a family of actors on the stage in what she calls "the little theater that could."
The truth is that MCT, tucked into an arcade between New Haven and Strawbridge avenues,
is the little theater that does: five plays plus a special Christmas show per season, most of which sell out.
Not for MCT are big, glitzy musicals or screaming displays of controversy. Under the direction of Girard, it mainly does plays, many of them comedies.
"Melbourne Civic Theatre is successful because Peg knows her audience," said Darcia Jones Francey, who has served on the MCT board for years. "She picks plays that may make you think, but won't leave you with you a headache."
Girard laughed and laid the reasons for MCT's success on the people with whom she works.
"The people around me have strived to make it a place people want to be," she said. "We have money in the bank and people in the seats, and it still is fun."
She picked "The Country House," Girard added, because of Margulies, in "a season of writers." The play has noble roots, a combination of "The Seagull" and "Uncle Vanya," by Anton Chekhov, and it has not been presented in Brevard previously.
"It's about a family of writers and performers, some famous and some who want to be," she said. "They gather at their summer house during the Williamstown Theatre Festival, and when things take an unexpected turn, everyone is forced to improvise. It is witty and compelling, and it is a play, not a farce, about a family coming to terms with the roles they play in one another's lives."
She named the characters: the eccentric son who "has a bit of an epiphany" as the play goes on; the one who plays a TV doctor but doesn't love everything about stardom; the director who is certain he could be doing great things, but is doing "those robot movies," as Girard called them, for 15-year-old boys; his new girlfriend, a struggling actor; the grande dame, a famous actress of stage and screen who must come to terms with age; and the granddaughter/daughter who still mourns her late mother, who is commemorated at the house.
Girard pointed out the play was well received in 2014 when it premiered in New York. The New York Times called it "A valentine to the artists of the stage" and the Wall Street Journal, "One of the most satisfying new American plays to reach Broadway in the past decade ... a truly affecting play."
Clearly it is not fluff, and, in Girard's words, "It's not like a present, all wrapped up in pretty things and everything's fine at the end."
However, "If you like to be happy, sad, or moved, this is your play," she said, and chuckled. "But get your tickets now. They're going fast."

John Roberts: the focus is on the man in the middle

Texto completo: A remarkable set of Harvard students took their degrees in June 1976. There was Yo Yo Ma, destined to become perhaps the world's greatest living cellist. There was Jill Abramson, who would become the first female executive editor of The New York Times. And there was John G. Roberts Jr., who in time would sit “at the exact center, the determinative center, of the law in America."
That description of the chief justice comes at the beginning of “The Chief," the new biography of Roberts by Joan Biskupic, the CNN legal analyst who has written biographies of Roberts colleagues Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Sonia Sotomayor. What timing. This book comes as interest in the court is sky high, a fact made plain during the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh. With the bench listing to the right all eyes are focused on Roberts and how he may wield his outsized influence. Buskupic's take? Roberts “is leading a Court increasingly in his own image," she writes, adding that he “is positioned at the center in every way and the law will be what he says it is."
From first to last, this is an approachable volume about subjects often unapproachable. Biskupic, who has covered the Supreme Court for a quarter century, captures the tensions within the group, the interplay among the justices, and the pressures brought to bear on them by outsiders — and, not least, by their colleagues. With seven interviews with Roberts accounting for more than 20 hours of conversation, “The Chief" is an ample and amiable companion to such insider accounts as “The Brethren," the classic 1979 book by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, and “The Nine," the influential 2007 book by Jeffrey Toobin.
Biskupic shows how, from the start, Roberts was at work assembling a gold-plated resume: a top Indiana prep school, Harvard and then Harvard Law, two federal court clerkships, including one with the man who would be his predecessor as chief justice, William Rehnquist, before winning a position in the Reagan Justice Department with Ken Starr (later to win fame, or opprobrium, as Bill Clinton's grand inquisitor). Through it all he developed strong feelings about voting-rights legislation and affirmative action. Mostly he was against them.
But for all that, Roberts was, and is, no creature of Washington, nor of the conventions of the capital, though he adopted the ever-upward ethos of working Washington, assuming an ever more prominent role and battling both government remedies for social problems and government assistance to abortion. By the time he joined the D.C. circuit court those inclinations had hardened into ideology.
It was a circuitous route that took him to the chief's perch at the Supreme Court. George W. Bush selected him to replace O'Connor but soon after Rehnquist died an even more alluring vacancy emerged. He won Senate confirmation as chief with precisely the argument that won him the original support of Bush, once the co-owner of the Texas Rangers: “Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules; they apply them. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ballgame to see the umpire."
He was confirmed by a 78-22 vote. One of the dissenters was Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.
The youngest and least experienced member of the court he would lead, Roberts displayed impressive political skills in a job he would repeatedly describe as being above politics. In the beginning there were rough patches. He clashed with Justice David Souter, a man not known for range wars or, for that matter, for even the mildest confrontation. He wanted high-court unanimity but rarely got it. He knew he headed what would become known as the Roberts Court and had definite ideas about how it would be conducted — and how it would be remembered.
Biskupic shows us times when Roberts didn't get his way. And she traces how, through his tenure, his conviction that, in race and other matters, people should be considered as individuals rather than members of a group shaped his views and decisions. Identity politics was not for him.
He emerged as the principal advocate for judges (in pay matters) and for the independence of the judiciary (even upbraiding President Trump for some of his more provocative attacks on courts). But for all his efforts to assert judicial impartiality, Buskupic argues, his role in the Citizens United decision, which permitted unrestricted expenditure for election ads, clearly identified him with corporate interests.
Roberts will be remembered, however, just as much for his role in upholding Obamacare and here Biskupic provides us a surpassingly clear analysis: “A pro-business conservative he understood the importance of the insurance industry to US businesses, and he was genuinely concerned about invalidating an entire law that had been approved through the democratic process to solve the intractable health-care problem."
In his dissent in the same-sex marriage case, Roberts asked: “Just who do we think we are? This is a court, not a legislature . . . We have to say what the law is, not what it should be." And in that vote Biskupic sees the essential Roberts:
“[O]ver the course of his legal life, a time when American social attitudes were changing rapidly, John Roberts was not changing. Central to his personality was a constancy, an immovability. He was fixed in his views." For readers of Biskupic's biography, Roberts, too, will become fixed in their views.

Called to See War's Horrors, a Poet Doesn't Blink

Texto completo: "Who is Gómez? Nobody knows."
The person who issued this cryptic statement was none other than Gómez himself -- Leonel Gómez Vides, a coffee farmer from El Salvador who showed up in Southern California on the doorstep of the poet Carolyn Forché in 1977, with a bundle of papers under his arm and his two young daughters in tow. Within a few days he persuaded Forché to make her first trip to El Salvador, just as the country was on the verge of civil war.
In "What You Have Heard Is True," Forché traces how this initial encounter with a stranger irrevocably changed the course of her art and her life. Forché was 27 at the time, a Midwesterner living in San Diego, with a budding reputation for her work. She had heard Gómez's name before, when she traveled to Spain to translate the poems of his cousin Claribel Alegría, though nobody could say for sure whether Claribel's cousin was working with the Salvadoran guerrillas or with the C.I.A.
Until the publication of this memoir, Forché's experiences in El Salvador -- seven "extended stays" between 1978 and 1980 -- have mostly stayed distilled in her poetry. "The Colonel," collected in "The Country Between Us" (1981), begins with an elegant dinner at a colonel's home (rack of lamb, green mangoes) and ends with him emptying a grocery sack full of human ears onto the table -- ghastly trophies from a dirty war.
Taking its title from the first line of that poem, Forché's memoir starts off slowly, as she describes in minute detail how she made the fateful and seemingly inexplicable decision to follow a mysterious stranger's directive to take such a perilous trip. But once Forché's story gathers momentum, it's hard to let the narrative go. "What You Have Heard Is True" is billed, per its subtitle, as "a memoir of witness and resistance." That's fair enough, but it does this riveting book a mild disservice; the memoir I read was more intricate and surprising than such an earnest descriptor lets on.
For a while, it isn't at all clear how much Gómez can be trusted. When he first shows up, he draws Forché pictures of Spanish galleons, explains how the conquistadors brutalized the Indians, and uses a toothpick holder and a saltshaker to dramatize the infighting among Salvadoran officers after nearly 50 years of a military dictatorship. He offers grisly disquisitions on the death squads, on the disappeared, on body parts washing up on the beach. Forché tells him that he would be better off enlisting a journalist to document what is happening in his country. "I want a poet," he insists. "Why do you think I came all this way?"
Once Forché arrives in El Salvador, Gómez drives her around in his white Toyota Hiace, constantly glancing in the rearview mirror, a handgun tucked into a copy of Time magazine between them. He takes her to the countryside to meet with peasant farmers, or campesinos, who don't have enough to eat. He takes her to the United States embassy, where the ambassador warns her against Gómez because "we don't know who he is." Gómez even takes her to El Salvador's military headquarters, where he talks candidly to a lieutenant colonel about how all the disappearances are making the army look bad -- before he asks whether he might use the lieutenant colonel's shower.
The whole thing comes across as baffling -- much as it does to Forché herself, at least at first. We gradually become acquainted with Gómez and his country through Forché's eyes, as she starts off knowing almost nothing, then learns a little bit, and then a little bit more. Gómez is incensed by the abject poverty in most of his country, where campesinos live in huts made of mud and junkyard scraps. "If the Salvadoran campesinos fight," he says, "they must win. If they do not win, they will suffer for another 200 years."
But he's also a landowner. He's against corruption and in favor of reform, yet he claims "no doctrinal allegiances." His copy of Machiavelli has been thumbed through so many times that it's held together with a rubber band. When Forché remarks on the Che Guevara poster in his home, he says: 'Yes, well, I have posters of Mussolini too, if the need arises."
She realizes that what Gómez calls his "symphony of illusion" -- "He talks to this one. He talks to that one." -- turns out to be the only way for him to help reformist efforts against a murderous regime while trying, as much as he can, to protect himself.
"Terror is the given of the place," Joan Didion wrote in her 1983 book "Salvador." Forché describes being chased by death squads -- not once, but twice. The killings become so indiscriminate that she grows familiar with the "rotting, sweet, sickening" smell of dead bodies left by the side of the road. An excerpt from the unpunctuated notes she took at the time -- scribbled in pencil, "to keep the writing light and erasable" -- captures how corpses were mutilated into instruments of intimidation: "When mere death no longer instills fear in the population the stakes must be raised the people must be made to see that not only will they die but die slowly and brutally."
Behind most of the killings during El Salvador's 12-year civil war were government forces, which were in turn bolstered by American money and American training. Forché alludes to the political context in the book, but the shape of her memoir hews closely to what she herself saw and heard -- and how, out of the horror, she began to discern what she needed to do.
Forché returned to the United States to write what she called "a poetry of witness" ("born to an island of greed / and grace where you have this sense / of yourself as apart from others"), married a war photographer, had a child. "You have to be able to see the world as it is, to see how it is put together, and you have to be able to say what you see," Gómez said, but he left it up to Forché to figure out the rest for herself. "I do not have your answers," he told her. "I am just a man."

Texto completo: When Trisha Yearwood came off a three-year world tour with Garth Brooks just in time for Christmas in 2017, the last thing she expected was to hear her husband say he'd like to get back on the road and do it all again – but in stadiums.
After all, that last tour was his first in 13 years.
"I thought he would maybe be like 'OK, I'm gonna take a break. I don't know if we're gonna do this ever like this again,'" Yearwood says with a laugh. "And then, because he's Garth, he's like 'We never really have done stadiums. What do you think?'"
It's been fun, she says, to watch as her husband approaches this stadium tour as though he's never toured before.
He's come up with "a brand new stage, a brand new look, some different elements to make every show in every city different," Yearwood says. "So as his wife and as a fellow artist, it's been really cool to see him take this on as 'I want people that see this show to say, 'Oh my gosh, I've never seen that.'"
Another thing that's different about this tour is that Yearwood isn't on the bill, although she will be hosting Trisha's Tailgate in the parking lot before the shows.
Back to 'Trisha business' "This is a Garth show," Yearwood says. "This past year I spent working on two new albums. I haven't made new music in a while. So I said, 'I would like to not be on the ticket.' That doesn't mean I won't make an appearance at a show now and then. But I also have other Trisha business I need to do. So I'd like the freedom to do that."
Yearwood laughs and says, "I didn't know at the time that I would end up in the parking lot, doing tailgates. I jokingly say, 'Garth's in the stadium and I'm in the parking lot.'"
It's not that she didn't love sharing the spotlight with her husband on that last tour.
"It really was a good experience," she says. "I've been making records since '91, so I've done a lot of touring. And I thought my favorite place was these small intimate theaters. But the Garth tour is its own thing. I've never been to a more energetic show in my life. So I got the opportunity of coming out in the middle of his set into all that energy and my job was just to kind of hold my own out there and not bring the energy down for when he came back out. I learned a lot. I learned how to perform in an arena."
There was no question, she says, as to whether or not she'd be joining Brooks on tour, even after opting out of a spot on the ticket.
"When we got married, we said we don't want to be together to be apart. So we really have tried for these 14 years to make sure we make our plans where we don't have to spend very much time apart."
Hosting a tailgate party is a natural for Yearwood.
"I'm a sports girl," she says. "So I know about tailgating for, you know, Georgia Bulldogs games. But when we did the world tour, we'd pull up for soundcheck and I'd notice that people were tailgating for the show. I guess I was late to the party on that. I didn't realize that everybody was doing that."
She did her first Trisha's Tailgate before last year's one-off show at Notre Dame.
"And it went really well," she says. "So we decided to do this in every city. We have a tent set up and there's gonna be seven or eight Trisha foods. There's gonna be games and drinks. I'm gonna do a food demo. It's just kind of a hangout for several hours before you can go in to see the stadium show."
At the Notre Dame tailgate, she says, "We did some macaroni and cheese, mini hot dogs, sliders, drinks. It's not like a little appetizer thing where you'll go into the stadium hungry. You'll definitely have a chance to eat some real food before you go in."
Why she loves to cook It's the sort of menu you'd expect if you've seen "Trisha's Southern Kitchen," a Food Network series that features Yearwood cooking Southern meals for her family and friends.
"I'd love to say I had this planned, but honestly, it was a happy accident," Yearwood says of the show. "I wrote a cookbook with my mom and my sister for fun. I never dreamed that there would even be a second cookbook. But when had a New York Times best-seller, the TV shows started calling. I actually thought, 'I don't know if it would be fun to stand behind a counter and tell people to add the butter' or whatever. But the Food Network was great about saying It can be whatever you want it to be. So we created this show that was a very off-the-cuff, not-scripted show that really was the book come to life. Telling the family story. Having my family, my sister and my best buddies on the show. We laugh a lot. And I think I represent most cooks because I'm not a chef. Most people cook like I do."
Yearwood's parents were amazing cooks, she says.
"So my sister and I growing up, our jobs were usually things like setting the table and cracking the ice cubes, because we didn't have an ice maker."
It wasn't until she'd gone off to college that she learned to cook.
"I moved into an apartment," she says. "And I didn't know how to make anything. So I called home and I think the first recipe my mother gave me is her potato salad, which is very Southern and has, like, four ingredients. When I made it and it tasted like hers, I thought 'Oh my gosh, I can do this.' I missed home, I missed my family and I was able to feed myself and my friends and also to create that feeling of comfort from home. There's such a connection there."
Her tailgate party is a benefit for Habitat for Humanity, which she and Brooks have been involved with for "probably 10 years now," she says.
"Garth and I started with Habitat a couple years after Katrina. We went to New Orleans and really we thought we were going to be celebrities that did a couple interviews and swung a hammer for a photograph. And we got hooked. I mean, that day, I learned how to frame a wall. I learned how to put a window in. I was like, 'I want to do this.' It's wonderful to give money. And we do that. We also sign items for charity. There are great ways to give. But getting in and getting your hands dirty, working alongside the homeowners, because Habitat's motto, which I love, is 'a hand up not a handout.' If you're gonna live in this house, you put in sweat equity. If they can't build for some reason, they work in the office, stuffing envelopes or whatever. They earn this home. So it's pretty amazing to see."
'Let's Be Frank' In February, she released a Frank Sinatra tribute album titled "Let's Be Frank."
"I've wanted to make a standards record for about 20 years," she says. "I grew up with my mom's music, which was a lot of things but she really loved old movies and musicals, so I knew all these songs since I was a kid."
That desire to do a full album of standards became more focused on Sinatra songs a couple years ago.
"The Grammys did a 100th birthday tribute to him," Yearwood says. "And Don Was was the musical director. He and I had worked together before and he said 'Have you ever thought about making an album of these songs?' I was like, 'Yes, I think about that all the time.'"
She assembled a list, Yearwood says, of about 100 songs.
"My criteria was if Frank recorded it, it was fair game," she says.

Texto completo: Two years before the election of President Trump and the bitter politics of border walls, Muslim bans and s---hole countries, the American publishing industry was facing an identity crisis. A viral social media movement led by writers of color called #WeNeedDiverseBooks began pushing the industry to acknowledge and address its resounding whiteness. The failure to cultivate the voices of American writers of minority and immigrant backgrounds was the failure to tell a full national story, writer Junot Diaz explained in a New Yorker essay.
Soon after the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Viet Thanh Nguyen published a piece in The New York Times arguing that the outcome was partly the failure of writers. "The struggle over the direction of our country," he wrote, "is also a fight over whose words will win and whose images will ignite the collective imagination." Immigrants needed to tell their story - and tell it better.
"The Good Immigrant" is a culmination of the current political moment and a natural extension of the ongoing work to integrate American publishing. The 26 essays in this anthology are deeply personal reflections on adolescence, family, love and identity as experienced and felt by the American immigrant artist. From published heavyweights like Teju Cole and Alexander Chee to newer voices like Muslim American punk-rocker Basim Usmani and Pakistani Kashmiri-American poet Fatimah Asghar, this banquet of writing is a triumphant celebration of American multiplicity.
The book was inspired by an original British edition, which was published at the height of the Brexit debate with a largely different roster of writers. In the introduction to the American edition, the editors, Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, explain that what both collections share is their desire to amplify the voices of immigrants through a kind of collective literary activism. In a cultural climate defined by xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies, this book seeks to showcase the gifts and humanity of immigrant artists.
It's a noble mission. And yet, as a reader, I worried that a collection defined by politics could crumble under the weight of good intentions. Essays lifted from social media outrage or powered by reactionary rage can satisfy in the instant but fade as the moment passes. Thankfully, this collection is a resounding success on multiple fronts. Its righteous rage is perfectly matched by its literary rewards.
The American edition of the "The Good Immigrant" is best heard as a surround-sound chorus that bristles with an unpredictable, electric energy. Language, style and rhythm shift with each piece, keeping our attention. In "Luck of the Irish," Maeve Higgins explores how white privilege helped her, an Irish immigrant living in the country illegally, as brown families in similar conditions are prosecuted. In a love letter to her mother, Indian-American writer Krutika Mallikarjuna finds humor in the ridiculous conundrum of dating in the multiracial mayhem of Brooklyn. "Of the many pitfalls of being a queer desi woman swimming through Tinder," she writes, "I never expected to find myself getting trashed in a bar trying to forget that I was on a date with a white girl named India."
Several of the essays are by first-time authors who work in other artistic mediums. My favorite essay is by Nigerian-American fashion designer Wale Oyejide. The African-inspired textiles and silhouettes of his celebrated fashion line Ikire Jones are regularly shown on global runways and featured prominently in the Oscar-winning blockbuster "Black Panther." In an essay about his artistic coming of age, Oyejide explores the struggles of stay-at-home fatherhood with biting humor and then widens his lens to a crisis of masculinity that fails to allow men to be more than conventional breadwinners and pursue the arts. He writes about his designs as a political instrument to restore dignity and beauty to black bodies draped in shades of violence and suffering in popular culture.
"Our uprisings don't always come in the guise of smashed windows, overturned cars or respectable slave owners forcibly torn from their stone housings in front of Capitol buildings. Sometimes they come in the form of building-sized brown faces broadcast on cinema screens, portraying characters who are miles away from the token mistress we have to come to accept for want of more inspiring alternatives," he writes. Immigrant creativity is about imagining new possibility, he explains: "There will be endless stories to write. And, increasingly, there will be audiences filled with us waiting to hear them being told."
The best work here offers reflections on the creative process, alongside the fear of family, society and failure that keeps many immigrant artists from expressing themselves. The collection concludes with a call to arms by novelist Jade Chang, with a practical step-by-step guide to embracing one's voice titled "How to Center Your Own Story."
As I finished "The Good Immigrant," my mind was buzzing with the multitude of voices, stories, heartbreaks and dreams featured in its 300-plus pages. The book is a welcome corrective to the nationalist calls for walls, borders and exclusion that seek to narrow the boundaries of what it means to be American. Each essay is a tantalizing introduction - and invitation - to the larger body of work these artists have already created and will continue to make long after this moment passes.
Bilal Qureshi is a culture writer and radio journalist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Newsweek, and on NPR.

Kids and parents plead for diversity in children's books. 8 great titles that deliver

Resumen: Scholastic issued a survey this week that showed demand rising from parents and kids for diversity in children's books.

Texto completo: Children see themselves in music artists and in movies like "Black Panther. "
But when they can't find themselves in children's books, that's a problem.
Scholastic's biennial Kids & Family Reading report released this week found that nearly half of kids ages 9-17 (45 percent) and parents with kids ages 6-17 (52 percent) want more books with diversity.
It's no wonder.
Not enough diversity
There aren't enough diverse children's books on the shelves, according to the Cooperative Children's Book Center, which updated its data on representation this month.
Just 11 percent of of children's books published in the U. S. in 2018 featured Africans or African-Americans, 7 percent featured Hispanic and 8 percent featured Asian characters. About 3,300 children's books published last year.
Andrea Davis Pinkney, Scholastic's executive editor and author of "A Poem for Peter" said in the report that a lack of diversity fails to expand a child's love of reading or sense of self.
"But when a young reader finds a story that positively reflects his or her own story — or presents the stories of people not like themselves — that child becomes encouraged to read more," Pinkney said. "This has a direct impact on how kids view their place in the world, and helps them develop empathy and open-mindedness. Tomorrow’s leaders need to see themselves in books. "
Black and Hispanic families had even stronger views on wanting more diverse stories. Seventy-five percent of black parents, 64 percent of Hispanic parents and 55 percent of Asian/multiple and other races with kids ages 9-17 want books they can read to their children or kids can choose books themselves with diverse storylines, characters or settings.
Demand is on the rise
The survey found that parents were more likely to want more diverse book characters in 2018 (29 percent) than in 2016 (21 percent).
Children ages 12-17 wanting greater diversity in characters, settings and storylines also grew from 13 percent in 2016 to 18 percent in 2018, according to the survey.
The Scholastic report surveyed 2,758 parents and children, plus one child age 6-17 from the same house.
8 diverse, multicultural books to read
Here are eight great books that you can read to your child, read together or recommend your child read.

Texto completo: When Trisha Yearwood came off a three-year world tour with Garth Brooks just in time for Christmas in 2017, the last thing she expected was to hear her husband say he'd like to get back on the road and do it all again – but in stadiums.
After all, that last tour was his first in 13 years.
"I thought he would maybe be like 'OK, I'm gonna take a break. I don't know if we're gonna do this ever like this again,'" Yearwood says with a laugh. "And then, because he's Garth, he's like 'We never really have done stadiums. What do you think?'"
It's been fun, she says, to watch as her husband approaches this stadium tour as though he's never toured before.
He's come up with "a brand new stage, a brand new look, some different elements to make every show in every city different," Yearwood says. "So as his wife and as a fellow artist, it's been really cool to see him take this on as 'I want people that see this show to say, 'Oh my gosh, I've never seen that.'"
Another thing that's different about this tour is that Yearwood isn't on the bill, although she will be hosting Trisha's Tailgate in the parking lot before the shows.
Back to 'Trisha business' "This is a Garth show," Yearwood says. "This past year I spent working on two new albums. I haven't made new music in a while. So I said, 'I would like to not be on the ticket.' That doesn't mean I won't make an appearance at a show now and then. But I also have other Trisha business I need to do. So I'd like the freedom to do that."
Yearwood laughs and says, "I didn't know at the time that I would end up in the parking lot, doing tailgates. I jokingly say, 'Garth's in the stadium and I'm in the parking lot.'"
Hosting a tailgate party is a natural for Yearwood.
"I'm a sports girl," she says. "So I know about tailgating for, you know, Georgia Bulldogs games. But when we did the world tour, we'd pull up for soundcheck and I'd notice that people were tailgating for the show. I guess I was late to the party on that. I didn't realize that everybody was doing that."
She did her first Trisha's Tailgate before last year's one-off show at Notre Dame.
"And it went really well," she says. "So we decided to do this in every city. We have a tent set up and there's gonna be seven or eight Trisha foods. There's gonna be games and drinks. I'm gonna do a food demo. It's just kind of a hangout for several hours before you can go in to see the stadium show."
At the Notre Dame tailgate, she says, "We did some macaroni and cheese, mini hot dogs, sliders, drinks. It's not like a little appetizer thing where you'll go into the stadium hungry. You'll definitely have a chance to eat some real food before you go in."
Why she loves to cook It's the sort of menu you'd expect if you've seen "Trisha's Southern Kitchen," a Food Network series that features Yearwood cooking Southern meals for her family and friends.
"I'd love to say I had this planned, but honestly, it was a happy accident," Yearwood says of the show. "I wrote a cookbook with my mom and my sister for fun. When I had a New York Times best-seller, the TV shows started calling. The Food Network was great about saying it can be whatever you want it to be. So we created this show that was a very off-the-cuff, not-scripted show that really was the book come to life. Telling the family story. Having my family, my sister and my best buddies on the show. We laugh a lot. And I think I represent most cooks because I'm not a chef. Most people cook like I do."
Yearwood's parents were amazing cooks, she says.
"So my sister and I growing up, our jobs were usually things like setting the table and cracking the ice cubes, because we didn't have an ice maker."
It wasn't until she'd gone off to college that she learned to cook.
"I moved into an apartment," she says. "And I didn't know how to make anything. So I called home and I think the first recipe my mother gave me is her potato salad, which is very Southern and has, like, four ingredients. When I made it and it tasted like hers, I thought 'Oh my gosh, I can do this.' I missed home, I missed my family and I was able to feed myself and my friends and also to create that feeling of comfort from home. There's such a connection there."
Her tailgate party is a benefit for Habitat for Humanity, which she and Brooks have been involved with for "probably 10 years now," she says.

Texto completo: CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand - Abdul Aziz was praying with his four sons in the Linwood Mosque when he heard the gunshots. Rather than run from the noise, he ran toward it, grabbed the first thing he could find - a credit card machine - and flung it at the attacker.
The man dropped a shotgun, and Aziz picked it up. "I pulled the trigger, and there was nothing," he recalled. The gunman ran to his car, where he had other weapons, and Aziz followed, throwing the shotgun at the vehicle and shattering a window.
Aziz's actions, which he and others described in interviews, may have prompted the gunman to speed away rather than return to kill more people. Minutes later, two police officers from another town who were in the area rammed the suspect's car into a curb and took him into custody, ending the worst mass murder in New Zealand's modern history.
Authorities have not released a detailed account of the police response to Friday's massacre at two mosques in the city of Christchurch, emphasizing that officers apprehended the suspect only 36 minutes after receiving the first emergency call.
But interviews with dozens of survivors, and an analysis of a video recorded by the attacker as well as one made of his arrest by a bystander, suggest that the violence ended after a near miss by the police at the first mosque - and acts of courage during and after the attack on the second.
If not for the two police officers, who have not been publicly identified, and Aziz, 48, a ponytailed furniture shop owner who fled Afghanistan a quarter-century ago, the slaughter might have continued. The suspect had two other guns in his car, police said, as well as two homemade explosives.
"It absolutely was his intention to continue with his attack," said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after the arrest of Brenton Tarrant, 28, a former personal trainer from Australia who allegedly distributed a manifesto of white extremist hatred minutes before the rampage.
Police said 42 people were killed at central Christchurch's Al Noor Mosque and seven at the Linwood Mosque, and some attributed the lower toll at Linwood to Aziz's decision to confront the gunman. An additional victim died at a hospital.
It is unclear exactly what time the gunman entered Al Noor, which was crowded with worshippers for Friday Prayer. But the police said that they received the first call for help at 1:41 p.m., and that the first officers arrived there six minutes later.
The video recorded by the gunman, which was livestreamed on Face-book, showed a man trying to tackle him inside the mosque, only to be shot and killed. Six minutes after firing his first shot, he drove away.
Then the gunman attacked the Linwood Mosque, almost four miles east of Al Noor.
Lateef Alabi, the imam leading prayers at Linwood, said he heard a voice outside at about 1:55 p.m. so he stopped and looked out a window. He saw a man in military gear, wearing a helmet and holding a gun.
Then he saw two bodies on the ground.
He shouted to the congregation of about 80 people to get down. The gunman turned and fired through a window. He kept firing.
Aziz ran toward him and threw the credit card machine, which was about the size of a large rock.
Both men were relatively short and powerfully built. "He took five, six, shots at me," Aziz recalled. "I dove between the cars."
Following the attacker, he found the shotgun, picked it up and tried to fire it at him, but it was empty.
Aziz said his children were screaming for him to come back, and the gunman seemed agitated, swearing and talking about "killing you all."
Earlier at Al Noor, the gunman had returned to his car, retrieved another weapon and gone back inside to kill again. But at Linwood, after Aziz threw the shotgun at the vehicle - "like an arrow," he said - the attacker drove away. "It was like my mind wasn't working," Aziz said. "It was automatic reaction, like anybody. I was prepared to give my life to save another life."
Officers-arrived at the mosque soon afterward, he and other survivors said.
Meanwhile, authorities had begun locking down the neighborhood and searching for the gunman.
Police said they arrested the suspect nearby at 2:17 p.m.
A video recorded by a bystander about 2.5 miles from Linwood shows the front of a police cruiser wedged into the right side of a sport utility vehicle and tilting it up against the curb on a leafy boulevard. The front tire of the suspect's vehicle is still spinning.
The suspect's trunk is open, and one officer with a handgun drawn is approaching the driver's side door, which is also open. The other officer, armed with a rifle, is circling around the front of the vehicle to back him up.
The first officer, still with gun drawn, pulls a rifle out of the vehicle with his free hand and tosses it on the sidewalk. Then he pulls the suspect out and the two officers subdue him.
Tarrant was charged with murder on Saturday. More charges are expected.

Would March Madness fans bet legally if they could?

Texto completo: The NCAA men’s basketball tourney starting this week will inspire 47 million Americans to wager $8.5 billion, Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, proclaims during a Monday conference call with the media.
More money will change hands during a few weeks of the tournament than the total value of goods produced and services provided in the nation of Haiti during an entire year. Nearly twice as many people bet on the tournament known as March Madness as they do on the Super Bowl.
"Americans like to bet on sports, and Americans do bet on sports," Miller says, adding that a survey shows only 4.1 million of those gamblers place bets legally with casino sportsbooks in Nevada or the seven states (Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) that legalized sports betting since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it possible.
Anyone in Illinois or those other states without legal sports booking who plunks down 5 bucks and fills out a bracket predicting the outcomes for all 68 teams in an office pool or with friends is breaking the law, although arrests are practically nonexistent.
"Most people don’t even know the activity they are participating in is illegal," Miller says. The American Gaming Association, the gambling trade group representing casinos, pushes the idea of making gambling on sports, including contests with amateur college athletes, legal in all states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has touted the idea as a way to help raise funds in Illinois, and bills to make that happen are brewing.
"Unlike any other sporting event in the country, March Madness attracts millions who fill out brackets, make casual bets with friends or wager at a legal sportsbook, which Americans can now do more than ever before," Miller says.
I first became emotionally invested in the March Madness tournament as a kid in 1969. Having played out a simulation of the final game on my driveway hoop a hundred times, I was confident my Purdue Boilermakers and superstar shooter Rick Mount were going to vanquish a UCLA team led by center Lew Alcinder. UCLA won 92-72, Alcinder went on to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mount went on to open a hunting and fishing store in his hometown of Lebanon, Indiana, and I learned that those of us who follow our hearts instead of our heads aren’t going to do well picking winners in NCAA tournaments.
That didn’t stop me from picking an all-Hoosier Final Four whenever possible, selecting from teams such as Indiana, Purdue, Butler, Notre Dame, Indiana State and Valparaiso. That gave me a few champions (thanks, IU) in the 1980s, and some stunning upsets (thanks, Butler and Valpo), but never a complete bracket that finished in the money. When The New York Times first gave readers a chance to fill out a bracket online, my picks after Day One had me among the top 25 people in the nation. By Day Two, I had fallen out of the top 1,500.
I haven’t even bothered to fill out a bracket in recent years, which makes me a winner (or at least a non-loser).
People want to bet on March Madness, and they do it illegally if they don’t have a legal option, Miller says.
Even if Illinois legalizes sports betting through the proper channels, people might still participate in illegal office pools because it’s more fun losing money to a co-worker than to a giant gambling institution. Miller adds that the casino industry spends $300 million on "responsible gaming" programs to recognize and help people for whom gambling is a problem.
My problem with gambling today is that I did enter a free online bracket pool and my simulation has Purdue, the only team from Indiana, winning the championship game 92-72 over Michigan State.

Texto completo: Amy Schumer shows off her baby bump in a new Netflix special. And a feel-good drama about friendly neighbors arrives on NBC.
What's Streaming
AMY SCHUMER GROWING (2019) Stream on Netflix. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Amy Schumer said that she had been able to brush off criticism of her comedy by simply not caring what people thought. But she did wonder how viewers would react to this new special. "I don't know what's going to happen," she said. "What's the thing people will be furious about?" In "Growing," Schumer delivers her signature dry humor, riffing on women, marriage and pregnancy. She raises her dress to flaunt her belly within the first few minutes of the special and jokes that tying the knot with her husband, who is a chef, was similar to the rapper Snoop Dogg "marrying weed."
COLD FEET: THE NEW YEARS Stream on Britbox. When the drama series "Cold Feet" debuted on ITV in 1997, it was seen as the British equivalent of "Friends": The show follows three couples in their 30s as they go about their lives in Manchester. It ended in 2003 after five seasons, and this revival, introduced in 2016, has been met with mixed reviews. Teenage children are in the picture, new romances have blossomed and now that the couples are in their 50s, the frailty of old age is a recurring theme. In a recent interview, Mike Bullen, the creator, said the latest season may be the best. "I'm wondering if we should call stop now, because I'm not sure we can improve on this series," he said.
What's on TV
THE VILLAGE 10 p.m. on NBC. This new drama series is based on a sincere, albeit quixotic, premise: That your city neighbors cannot only introduce themselves to you -- they can become your second family. Such is the case with our characters, the residents of a building in Brooklyn who actually look out for one another. Among them are a single mother (Michaela McManus) and her teenage daughter, a young law student (Daren Kagasoff) and a veteran returning from service (Warren Christie).
MENTAL SAMURAI 9 p.m. on Fox. Bored with "Jeopardy!"? This new trivia-competition show hosted by Rob Lowe presents a strange twist. Contestants must answer 12 questions correctly in five minutes for a chance to win $100,000. And they must do so while sitting in a robotic capsule that whips them around the set. Lowe explains that the format is designed to "test their mental agility while being pushed to their physical limits." With the players being flung around, the real question is: Can they make it to the end without losing their lunch?
THE JIM JEFFERIES SHOW 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. This Australian late-night host brings his traveling show back for a third run. This season he flies to Hong Kong to understand the story behind shark fins; experiences his own funeral in South Korea; and goes on an African safari with a group of intrepid rangers.

Franklin's family blasts Williams, defends film

Texto completo: ... while Franklin had initially imposed an injunction on "Amazing Grace," her objections had nothing to do with its quality; negotiations were incomplete at the time of her death.
Statement from Aretha Franklin's estate
Aretha Franklin's estate is blasting Wendy Williams for "irresponsible" and "mocking" remarks after the talk-show host attacked the late singer's upcoming, long-delayed gospel film.
In a lengthy fact-checking statement Sunday, the Queen of Soul's family said Williams made "inaccurate and disparaging statements" during a Friday segment about "Amazing Grace." Shot in 1972, the church performance is set to hit screens nationwide in April.
Departing from widespread critical acclaim for the film, Williams questioned its visual quality, Franklin's natural look and the motivations behind the movie's release.
Franklin's estate said Williams' commentary "indicates that she has neither seen the documentary nor understands its import or intent."
Williams also seemed to accuse Franklin's family of mismanaging the singer's affairs through the years: "When you don't have real professional people doing real professional things for you, sometimes you lose out."
The family's response pushed back: "Contrary to Williams' derisive reference, there is no 'Cousin Junebug' making decisions for the Estate."
"Amazing Grace" will hit theaters nationwide April 19 after events in Detroit and other cities. Shot by Sydney Pollack at an L.A. church while Franklin recorded her top-selling gospel album of the same name, the footage was abandoned for decades before being shaped into a final cut by UCLA music professor Alan Elliott.
Though Franklin told the Detroit Free Press in 2015 "I love the film itself," she stonewalled the release, securing two court injunctions and saying she had not licensed use of her likeness.
Following her death in August, her estate cleared the way for the film's premiere, and early screenings have earned glowing reviews from critics.
On Friday's episode of "The Wendy Williams Show," Williams set out to sympathize with Franklin resistance to the movie, calling it a "one-camera shot" (Pollack used five cameras) and pointing out Franklin's unglamorous appearance in the church setting.
The family fired back in its statement.
"1972 was the era of Black Power and Black Is Beautiful," the estate said. "In her short natural hair and simple makeup, Ms. Franklin was in step with the times and appropriate to the occasion. There was no 'showgirl glamor,' no 'pressed hair' and no 'eyelashes' – the lack of which Williams ridiculed on her program. The simplicity of the presentation gives 'Amazing Grace' its power."
Williams also speculated that the film is being released only because Franklin's estate is in a financial "mess."
"I would imagine that now the bill collectors are like, 'OK, rest in peace, Aretha Franklin. But we still need our money for this, we need money for that,'" Williams said, prompting "oohs" from her audience. "So by putting this movie out, I would say the estate is probably going to be paying bills with this."
Franklin's estate said the talk-show host was perpetuating falsehoods in the era of "fake news."
"While Franklin had initially imposed an injunction on 'Amazing Grace,' her objections had nothing to do with its quality; negotiations were incomplete at the time of her death," the statement read.
The Free Press was unable to reach Williams or a spokesman for a response on Sunday.
Full response from Franklin's estate to Williams on 'Amazing Grace' Aretha Franklin was an icon, a musical genius, and a much-awarded American cultural treasure. Therefore, it is astounding that on the March 15, 2019, broadcast of The Wendy Williams Show, host Wendy Williams made a series of inaccurate and disparaging statements about the Aretha Franklin concert film "Amazing Grace," which opens in limited theaters on April 5, 2019, and nationally on April 19, 2019. Her commentary indicates that she has neither seen the documentary nor understands its import or intent.
First, "Amazing Grace" was conceived as a documentary. The footage was shot by Oscar-winning director Sydney Pollack in anticipation of broadcasting a once-in-a-lifetime event – a live gospel album recording – but was never completed for technical reasons. The film remnants were rediscovered, restored and championed over two decades by producer Alan Elliott. As such, the unburnished images capture Aretha Franklin in New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles in 1972, as a premiere R&B and gospel interpreter who had just notched eight consecutive R&B Number One hits. Ms. Franklin had specifically sought to perform in a stripped-down, church-service setting. By showing a brief clip out of context and mocking its quality on her show, Williams inaccurately represented Ms. Franklin and the movie to her audience.
Second, 1972 was the era of Black Power, and Black Is Beautiful. In her short natural hair and simple makeup, Ms. Franklin was in step with the times and appropriate to the occasion. There was no "showgirl glamor," no "pressed hair" and no "eyelashes" – the lack of which Williams ridiculed on her program. The simplicity of the presentation gives "Amazing Grace" its power. Scholars, film critics, pop culture experts, and Hollywood stalwarts have raved about the film, including Oscar-winning director Spike Lee, who recently came aboard as a producer and told Variety the film is "mesmerizing and transformative."
Third, Williams mentioned that Ms. Franklin "made an album from this." She failed to note that the album is Aretha Franklin's seminal recording "Amazing Grace," which sold more than two million copies, earned a Grammy Award, and is still the biggest-selling live gospel album of all time. By not highlighting this fact, Williams further diminished both the documentary and Ms. Franklin's legacy.
Fourth, Williams' statement that "Nobody's going to the movies to see a one-shot deal, like black-and-white," is punitive and misinformed. Thousands if not millions are clamoring to see this full-color film; many have already enjoyed repeated viewings during last December's Oscar-qualifying one-week run in L.A. and N.Y., where the film earned glowing reviews in publications from Rolling Stone to The New York Times. "Amazing Grace" earned a 95-average rating on Metacritic and a 96 critical score at Rotten Tomatoes.
Finally, Williams suggests that the Franklin Estate sought national distribution for "Amazing Grace" to satisfy the singer's outstanding debts. This is not true. It is only through the approval of the Estate and the efforts of the film's producers that it is finally being seen. The public rollout for "Amazing Grace" – which includes screenings at African American museums and black churches this month – has received support from African American pastors and fans across the country. And while Franklin had initially imposed an injunction on "Amazing Grace," her objections had nothing to do with its quality; negotiations were incomplete at the time of her death. Her family feels this documentary is another prime example of The Queen of Soul's genius.
Williams gave additional false information in her March 15 program. Sabrina Owens, Ms. Franklin's niece and executor of her estate, has never been head of the singer's security detail. Ms. Owens is a career professional who holds a Master's degree and is employed as a chief negotiator at one of the nation's top public universities. Further, she is the personal representative of her mother's estate, singer and songwriter Erma Franklin. Owens also created the blueprint for Franklin's Celebration of Life and week-long homegoing services. None of Ms. Franklin's four sons has ever served as her manager. However, Franklin's brother, Rev. Cecil Franklin, who was a Morehouse College graduate was her manager for more than 30 years, until his death in December 1989. Contrary to Williams' derisive reference, there is no "Cousin Junebug" making decisions for the Estate.
Wendy Williams is the host of the most-watched daytime gossip show in syndicated television. However, that does not give her license to offer misleading commentary about a legacy entertainer based on unverified information. In this instance, the show's research team let Williams down. At a time when the media is fighting a battle against "fake news," Williams' continues to perpetuate false facts, and her commentary was irresponsible.

Texto completo: Goldman Sachs, one of the last bastions of crisp-collared, bespoke-suited workplace attire, has loosened up. It announced an official "firm-wide flexible dress code earlier this month. And at last - after the long, slow undoing of corporate formality - business casual seems to have triumphed in the American workplace.
But for women and minorities who have been playing corporate catch-up for decades, a more casual dress code presents its own complications.
As one Goldman Sachs banker in GQ put it: "All the men are psyched.
For everyone else, dressing more casually for work can be fraught, even risky. Over decades, expensive suits have projected power on Wall Street, almost like a piece of "armor, said Susan Scafidi, academic director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University.
Women at work who feel pressure to prove they deserve to be in the room might be wary of ditching their blazers and pumps.
"We've just achieved the parity of the pantsuit, and suddenly we're told the standard pantsuit is no longer standard workforce attire, Scafidi said. "Women will need to find another way to achieve parity in attire at business casual or some other lower level of formality.
Parity, of course, extends not only to power, but to pay.
Jaclyn Wong, who researches the intersection of gender and professional life, co-published a study in 2016 looking at the differences in how men and women are rewarded for attractiveness in the workplace.
Attractive men and women make roughly 20 percent more than their less attractive co-workers, Wong found. Even so, they are measured by different standards.
For women, perceived attractiveness was based on grooming, like hairstyle, makeup, fitness and clothing. They are rewarded, Wong said, for looking the part.
For men, grooming counts far less. If attractive, they tend to be rewarded whether they are well-groomed or not.
"We know that appearance matters for women and people of color in being seen as competent and worthy of respect, said Wong, a professor of sociology at University of South Carolina. "It becomes this difficult position: Do I want to dress down because I don't want to be seen as this kind of stiff and un-fun person, or do I want to continue dressing up because that's the only way people will treat me with respect?'
Goldman Sachs is following other firms in a hunt for tech talent that is most comfortable with the sneakers and hoodies of Silicon Valley. Also it is accommodating a growing fraction of its workforce that is made up of millennials - with about 75 percent of its workers under 40, and dressing in a way that fits more casually dressed clients.
The investment bank, which announced the change in a memo, called for employees to "please dress in a manner that is consistent with your clients' expectations, but stressed that they should "exercise good judgment. A spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the memo.
"Good judgment, of course, is open to interpretation.
"You have to decide: How do you present yourself when you're often the only woman in the room? said Jane Newton, a managing partner at RegentAtlantic. Newton spent 17 years at JPMorgan and runs a forum for women in leadership on Wall Street. "In a male-dominated environment, gravitas becomes a key variable in decisions that are made about your potential.
Workers tend to take their signals from the top. According to the lore of Corporate America, IBM made its first big leap decades ago when executives such as Louis V. Gerstner Jr. changed up the uniform of suit and tie and white collar - by mixing in a blue button-down shirts.
A 1995 headline in the New York Times read "Black Jeans Invade Big Blue after Gerstner said he was rolling out casual dress. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard's relaxed "Blue Sky Days on Fridays were said to influence future generations of tech entrepreneurs.
Today, it's Goldman CEO David Solomon, who performs as a DJ in his spare time and has appeared in interviews without a tie.
In the 80s and 90s, there were few role models for women on Wall Street, Newton said, so they tried to blend in. Men in suits cut imposing figures, so women wore blazers with padded shoulders. Men wore ties, so women wore blouses with pussy bows.
Fashion is far more flexible now, she said, but younger women still ask Newton the same questions about how to present themselves to be taken seriously. Sometimes she offers to go shopping with them, or she pages through catalogues to show what works and what doesn't.
Women on Wall Street have adapted to more casual norms. But some still face the possibility that they could be perceived as lacking power when they dress down at work, said Laura Sherbin, managing director of Culture@Work, a division of Working Mother Media that helps companies develop best practices around diversity.
"When a woman is dressed informally, she's more likely to be assumed to be more junior or to be someone's assistant, Sherbin said. The topic of dress codes still comes up all the time in focus groups she does at companies, she said.
Sherbin recalls working with one management consulting client that had a relaxed dress code. She complimented a sharply dressed female executive whose look - black dress, edgy black leather jacket with zippers - was powerful. The executive, who was headed into a tough strategy meeting, told Sherbin she was relieved to hear it.
"I want to walk in the room and be seen as fierce and somebody who's not going to back down so instantly, the executive said. "I never would have worn pastels today.
For women of color, issues of image at the office are thornier. In schools throughout the country, girls of color are more likely to be punished for dress code violations, according to a report by the National Women's Law Center.
Even the freshmen women of Congress - the most female and diverse group ever - have inspired a huge amount of discussion about red lipstick, hoop earrings and ethnic garb. In some cases much more than their actual platforms and ideas.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put it this way: "If I walked into Congress wearing a sack, they would laugh & take a picture of my backside. If I walk in with my best sale-rack clothes, they laugh & take a picture of my backside.
A more relaxed dress code means a broader range of choices, and "a broader range of choices means greater possibility for error, Scafidi said. "So while men will naturally gravitate toward old-fashioned polos and khakis - or possibly to fleece and jeans - women don't have a business casual uniform in the same way.
Maureen Sherry worked 12 years on Wall Street and was the youngest managing director at Bear Stearns.
"Women never walked in wearing khakis or athleisurewear, she said. "Professional women just didn't do that because we wanted to be in meetings and not have our outfit be a point of discussion.
She wrote a novel, "Opening Belle, about a female Wall Street executive, based partly on her experience as well as interviews with other women.
"A friend of mine wore the first pantsuit on the Salomon Brothers trading floor in 1991, and it caused an uproar, she said. "She still has it as a kind of trophy.
Today, she said, "if you saw a woman wearing Birkenstocks or loafers, we'd like to think that we're not taking her less seriously as a result, but I'm not sure if that's true.
Although shifting norms add to the litany of micro-decisions women must make before they set foot in the office, they do signal more freedom.
In the past, Newton said, "there were these clear, unwritten rules, but who wrote the rules? The men, so we adapted to them so that we could fit in.
"Now we can write our own rules, she said, "to the extent that we're comfortable.

Don't blame robots for low wages

Texto completo: The other day I found myself, as I often do, at a conference discussing lagging wages and soaring inequality. There was a lot of interesting discussion. But one thing that struck me was how many of the participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem - that machines are taking away the good jobs, or even jobs in general. For the most part this wasn't even presented as a hypothesis, just as part of what everyone knows.
And this assumption has real implications for policy discussion. For example, a lot of the agitation for a universal basic income comes from the belief that jobs will become ever scarcer as the robot apocalypse overtakes the economy.
So it seems like a good idea to point out that in this case what everyone knows isn't true. Predictions are hard, especially about the future, and maybe the robots really will come for all our jobs one of these days. But automation just isn't a big part of the story of what happened to American workers over the past 40 years.
We do have a big problem - but it has very little to do with technology, and a lot to do with politics and power.
Let's back up for a minute, and ask: What is a robot, anyway? Clearly, it doesn't have to be something that looks like C-3PO, or rolls around saying "Exterminate! Exterminate!" From an economic point of view, a robot is anything that uses technology to do work formerly done by human beings.
And robots in that sense have been transforming our economy literally for centuries. David Ricardo, one of the founding fathers of economics, wrote about the disruptive effects of machinery in 1821.
These days, when people talk about the robot apocalypse, they don't usually think of things like strip mining and mountaintop removal. Yet these technologies utterly transformed coal mining: Coal production almost doubled between 1950 and 2000 (it only began falling a few years ago), yet the number of coal miners fell from 470,000 to fewer than 80,000.
Or consider freight containerization. Longshoremen used to be a big part of the scene in major port cities. But while global trade has soared since the 1970s, the share of U.S. workers engaged in "marine cargo handling" has fallen by two-thirds.
So technological change is an old story. What's new is the failure of workers to share in the fruits of that technological change.
While there have always been some victims of technological progress, until the 1970s rising productivity translated into rising wages for a great majority of workers. Then the connection was broken. And it wasn't the robots that did it.
What did? There is a growing though incomplete consensus among economists that a key factor in wage stagnation has been workers' declining bargaining power - a decline whose roots are ultimately political.
Most obviously, the federal minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by a third over the past half century, even as worker productivity has risen 150 percent.
The decline of unions, which covered a quarter of private-sector workers in 1973 but only 6 percent now, may not be as obviously political. But other countries haven't seen the same kind of decline. What made America exceptional was a political environment deeply hostile to labor organizing and friendly toward union-busting employers.
Consider the case of trucking, which used to be a good job but now pays a third less than it did in the 1970s, with terrible working conditions. What made the difference? De-unionization was a big part of the story.
And these easily quantifiable factors are just indicators of a sustained, across-the-board anti-worker bias in our politics. American workers can and should be getting a much better deal than they are. And to the extent that they aren't, the fault lies not in our robots, but in our political leaders.

Jazz up your business with these leadership lessons

Texto completo: For over 40 years, I've proudly worn the title of jazz guitarist. Deeply passionate about the art form, I performed my way through college and continue to savor the delicious melodies of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Dizzy Gillespie.
Ironically it was jazz – not B-school – that gave me the foundation to win in the business world. While on the surface it would seem that jazz musicianship is the polar opposite of running a business, the two practices are linked in numerous ways.
Just as you'd learn a great deal from a trusted adviser, so too can non-traditional sources help you to expand your knowledge base. Jazz musicians are agile and dynamic, carrying their group's song and themes through the diversified landscape to the end.
For this very reason, let's explore how a jazz musician leads and what we can learn from his or her artistry and execution.
Here are some powerful takeaways I've picked up along the way from incredible musician leaders – let these lessons shine at your business, and your results will get a lot swankier.
1. Playing it safe gets you tossed off the stage. Some executives would say that in today's turbulent economy, takings risks isn't wise. If you don't take risks, you'll never excel. Playing it safe all the time becomes the most dangerous move of all.
2. There are no do-overs in live performances. For every hour in a "performance" setting, you should spend five hours practicing. Athletes do this, musicians do this –muscle memory is no different in the board room, in front of a new client, or with your team. So why aren't you doing this?
3. Listening to those around you is more important than what you play yourself. If you're the one talking all the time, you're not learning anything. Listen, absorb what you hear, and use the information to make a conscious choice about whatever you're facing.
4. There's a time to stand out as a soloist. And a time to support others and make them shine. You rocked a project – nicely done. Praise is well-deserved. However, as a leader, it's more likely the case that your team members rocked a project, together. Susie was on top of her game with the slide deck? Tell her – and tell the client. Johnny couldn't have articulated the challenge to the press any more astutely? Refer back to his commentary as a stellar example. When you can share the wealth, everyone wins.
5. Expect surprises and adversity, since jazz (and life) is about how you adapt. If running a business was always smooth sailing, everyone would do it. That being said, the old adage explains that "a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor." Anticipate hurdles and maximize your team's effort to jump over them.
6. Know your audience; ensure they're picking up what you're putting down. If you're playing for a group that's looking forward to something slow and calming and you get on stage and play a wild and crazy, upbeat riff, nobody will dig it – even if it's a well-crafted piece. Your customers are the same. If you're not working to provide them with something they want and need, you're doomed to fail.
7. It's always better leaving people wanting more, rather than less. Of course as you live and breathe your business, you have a visceral urge to share every piece of minutia with anyone who asks. Don't. Instead of pouring it all on at once, give people a teaser, so they crave the next bit you explain. In similar fashion, don't try and launch 15 products at once for a new line; start with one or two to get people begging for more.
8. The best leaders are those who make others sound good. Big band leaders bring out the best in their troupes – during a sax solo, his job is to make sure the drum line supports the sax player with a quality backdrop to make the riff shine especially bright. Are you putting these pieces together on your team? Where could someone excel that they're being held back? Shatter those boundaries and encourage creativity to soar.
9. Pattern recognition is easier than raw genius. If you drive the same way to work every day for a year, you're bound to learn about – and avoid – the pothole on Main Street that you pass each time. Jazz is no different; if you've played combinations countless times, it becomes second nature to pair new things together based on previous patterns. So too in business, seasoned executives and professionals have seen so many types of people, deals, projects, and processes, so it becomes easier for them to avoid these proverbial potholes, rather than having to start from scratch every time.
10. Shy musicians are starving artists. If you're playing a gig, you get paid when there are butts in seats, so you can't be shy in telling people about the upcoming show. Why haven't you been this bold in your new product launch? Are your employees evangelical about your company's culture? Are your vendors singing your praises?
11. Keeping it new and fresh is mandatory. Jazz has its roots in real-time, collaborative innovation, just like the act of starting and growing companies. If you're not actively seeking new challenges and ways to expand your horizons, you are automatically falling behind.
Legendary jazz pianist Dave Brubeck put it best, and his words resonate not only on stage for musicians but also in life for business leaders. "There's a way of playing safe, there's a way of using tricks and there's the way I like to play, which is dangerously, where you're going to take a chance on making mistakes in order to create something you haven't created before."

Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.

The reception is a celebration, an awards presentation and a scholarship fundraiser all rolled into one. Tickets are now available. The evening celebrates the successes of women both on-campus and in the community while also raising money to fund scholarships to help more women reach their goals.
Retired Lt. Colonel Kate Germano will be the special guest speaker for the event. Germano is the former commander of the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island and she co-authored the book "Fight Like a Girl: The Truth Behind How Female Marines are Trained" with Kelly Kennedy.
Her military career encompassed 20 years of service as a United States Marine Corps officer and combat veteran. When she took command of the Parris Island post, which exclusively trains female recruits, she raised expectations for the women and in response, their shooting qualifications equaled those of men, injuries dropped and morale improved. She was then relieved of her command.
Nevertheless, she continued her fight against reduced expectations for women and has gained national attention for her fight against sexism and bias not only within the military but in other segments of American society, including the government and the education and corporate systems. Her writings on topics such as national security, gender and leadership have been published in a wide variety of national media including the New York Times, TIME magazine, U.S. News and World Report and the Washington Post. She has appeared on NPR, Vice News Tonight, C-Span and the PBS NewsHour, to name a few.
Germano will share her insights about appreciating different perspectives, backgrounds and beliefs, identifying and removing emotional blocks to communication and community, and improving individual and team results and the organizational structure to build success.
A variety of awards will be presented and recognition will be given to a number of deserving women during the celebration, including annual scholarships presented by the American Association of University Women and the SIU Women’s Club.
Activities begin at 4:30 p.m.
There’s a full slate of activities planned that evening at various locations within Morris Library: the rotunda, the Hall of Presidents and Chancellors and the John C. Guyon Auditorium.
The event begins with a silent auction at 4:30 p.m. and runs until 5:45 p.m. The reception, featuring wine and hors d’oeuvres is set for 5-6 p.m. with the awards from 6 to 7 p.m. Only guests 21 and older will be served wine.
Tickets are now available for Celebrate Women. They are $25 each or $15 for SIU students with a valid ID. They can be purchased by contacting Martha Ellert of AAUW at 618/521-0613 or msellert@aol.com.
Event sponsors include Idea Creative Marketing, Silkworm, Centennial Roots, College of Liberal Arts, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, American Association of University Women (AAUW), Cristina Pisoni State Farm representative, Analisa Parker Attorney at Law, Just Josh 24 hr Cleaning Service and Alto Vineyards. Additional sponsors are welcome. To learn more about sponsorship opportunities or the event itself, contact Bobbi Knapp, kinesiology associate professor, at bknapp@siu.edu.
"Celebrate Women: Honoring Inclusive Excellence" is one of the numerous activities slated during Women’s History Month at SIU.

THE BIDEN PARADOX, AND HOW TO SOLVE IT BIDEN IS THE MOST POPULAR DEMOCRAT BUT HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF WINNING HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION

Texto completo: Joe Biden, apparently on the cusp of declaring his third run for the White House, is caught in a paradox that might be without precedent in modern American presidential politics. Nearly everyone thinks he can beat Donald Trump. At the same time, virtually no one thinks he'll get the nomination and the chance to do it - notwithstanding the latest polls, which are just measuring name recognition.
How can this be the case? How can the Democrats have a candidate they all agree would stand a very strong chance of recapturing the White House, gaining the power to appoint liberal Supreme Court justices and all the rest, and yet not be hankering to send that candidate into battle?
Some of this reflects on the party. We're just not at a point in history where Democratic activists are going to grant any sort of automatic advantage to a white male. If anything, the opposite will be the case (except with regard to Bernie Sanders partisans, but they're not necessarily Democratic activists).
This wariness toward white-maledom makes some people nervous because, well, let's be blunt: With one exception, in the form of a person who was an exceedingly rare political talent and who benefited from a world-historic economic meltdown seven weeks before the election, this country has elected only white males to the presidency. The white non-male who was supposed to be a shoo-in last time lost.
This has left some people thinking - and not just men, but, in my experience, a number of feminist women - that the Democrats should just submit to this perceived reality and nominate someone who (ahem) "looks the part."
But the bulk of the energy among the party's activist base is probably in the other direction. I would not say, and I don't think any Democrat should say, that a woman or a person of color (or both) can't win the presidency in 2020. An African-American woman almost became the governor of Georgia, and one can certainly argue that the American electorate is somewhat to the left of the Georgia electorate.
Mr. Trump is unpopular, and may well be more so after the Mueller report and a raft of congressional hearings. Many economists anticipate a recession. Given all these factors, and the likely makeup of the 2020 electorate (less than 70 percent white), it's not so difficult to imagine a non-white male winning.
And yet, over here sits Mr. Biden, still widely considered the Democrat most likely to beat the president, and possibly by a comfortable margin. But because his long record of public service includes some episodes that have worn quite poorly in our era, the nomination may be beyond his grasp. Is there any way for him to break out of this box?
Mr. Biden has three problems, which I would rank in this order: first, his handling of the Anita Hill matter during the Clarence Thomas hearings, when he decided not to call other witnesses who could have corroborated Ms. Hill's testimony; second, some of his positions on race, including opposition to busing and support for the 1994 crime bill and some comments he made back then about "predators on our streets"; and third, his reputation as a Democrat too fully of his era, too centrist and corporate.
Mr. Biden's first instinct will most likely be to explain and justify. That used to work in politics much of the time. It doesn't anymore in the age of social media. Today, self-justification is among the greatest offenses a public figure can commit.
Twitter is toxic and awful, and it's always useful to remember that Twitter is not America. That said, the medium does efficiently reduce matters to their essence. And if Mr. Biden tried to defend his actions around the Thomas hearings - or to use his vice presidency under Barack Obama as cover - he would be savaged on social media, and that would metastasize into the conventional wisdom on him.
So, regarding Anita Hill, he needs to say he was wrong. And, crucially, he has to make clear exactly what he has learned in the intervening 28 years. That's the hard part, but it's what may convince his skeptics that he is a different person now. The same is true of his past position on school desegregation.
On crime, he's probably free to do a bit more contextualizing, explaining how big a problem crime was then. But if that's the main thing people hear, it will again sound too self-justifying. Far better to say, "That was then, this is now," tick off a list of initiatives aimed at improving the prospects of young black men and point out all the things he has done over the years along those lines.
Finally, with respect to his centrism, Mr. Biden needs to pull off the trick, which dexterous politicians can do, of showing that he has nudged himself a bit to the left without sounding inauthentic. He might nod here toward young people, acknowledging that if he'd grown up with the capitalism that they did, he'd be mad, too.
If Mr. Biden can acknowledge this and convince the doubters that he's learned from the past, the Biden Paradox could be overcome. But of course, he has to actually believe he was once wrong on these questions, and this we do not know.

New York Attorney Probing Pres. Trump Business Deals

Texto completo: New York's attorney general has opened a civil investigation into President Donald Trump's business dealings, taking action after his former lawyer told Congress he exaggerated his wealth to obtain loans.
A person familiar with the inquiry said Attorney General Letitia James issued subpoenas March 11, to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank seeking records related to four Trump real estate projects and his failed 2014 bid to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills.
The person wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The New York Times first reported the subpoenas.
Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, told Congress in late February that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank when he was trying to obtain financing to buy the Bills.
He told a House committee it was common for Trump to overstate his wealth when dealing with the news media or banks, but understate it when it came time to pay his taxes.
Messages left with the banks and the Trump Organization were not immediately returned.
The subpoenas issued by the attorney general seek loan applications, as well as mortgages, credit lines and other documents related to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., buildings in Chicago and New York and a golf course in the Miami area.
James, a Democrat newly elected to office, pledged to look into Trump's business practices, saying after her victory last November that she'd be "shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings and every dealing."
Trump has complained that James is waging a politically motivated vendetta against him. Her office is also overseeing a lawsuit against a Trump charitable foundation. James' predecessors sued Trump over the operations of Trump University, his real estate school.
Previously, a different New York state agency, which regulates insurance companies, launched an inquiry into Cohen's allegations that Trump also misled insurance companies about his financial worth.
Trump has said Cohen is lying to try to get out of a prison sentence for tax evasion, campaign finance violations, making false statements to banks and lying to Congress.

Texto completo: One of the biggest Bay Area names implicated in the college admissions scandal is Bill McGlashan, who managed funds for one of the world's largest private equity investors.
He now is on leave from TPG Growth, an investment fund he managed for TPG Capital, a $103 billion investment fund.
TPG said McGlashan is on "indefinite administrative leave effective immediately," and co-CEO Jim Coulter is taking over as interim managing partner of TPG Growth and the Rise Fund, a global investment fund that touts itself as being just as concerned about its social impact as its returns.
The Rise Fund, which McGlashan helped form, has a star-studded lineup of board members, that include U2's Bono, Jeff Skoll and Pierre Omidyar of eBay fame, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Laurene Powell Jobs, Richard Branson and more. The New York Times wrote about the fund when it launched in 2016, saying it promised to be different.
"The problem with most of these kinds of funds is what Mr. McGlashan calls greenwashing,' a euphemism for lying, which some in philanthropy feel is rampant among socially conscious investors," it said.
McGlashan is accused of paying $50,000 to get a son into USC. According to court documents, that involved cheating on his son's ACT score. He allegedly also discussed sending a photo of his son to be Photoshopped onto a kicker's body so his son could be admitted as a recruit of the university's football team. McGlashan is one of 50 defendants in the nationwide case made public Tuesday when indictments were unsealed.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Hercules Capital private equity founder Manuel Henriquez, who is among those charged in the bribery scandal, has stepped down as CEO and chairman of that Palo Alto hedge fund. Hercules announced Wednesday that Henriquez will remain on the board and as an adviser to the company.
McGlashan also is on leave from some of his other commitments, including the advisory board of Stanford Graduate School of Business, a department spokeswoman said Wednesday. McGlashan has an MBA from the department and also is a graduate of Yale.
He serves on the board of Common Sense Growth, the investing arm of San Francisco nonprofit Common Sense Media, a tech and entertainment advocacy group for children and families. Common Sense said Wednesday that McGlashan remains on the board but that it would have no additional comment.
McGlashan is on the board of trustees at Marin Academy, the private prep school in San Rafael, which in a statement Tuesday denied knowing about the "alleged illegal and highly unethical behavior detailed in the charges."
In addition, McGlashan is listed on the boards of Brava, a Redwood City company that makes smart ovens, and e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics company based in Oakland. Those companies did not return requests for comment Wednesday.
McGlashan also is in the entertainment business. He is co-founder and board member of STX Entertainment, a Burbank-based company that has produced movies such as "The Upside," "Second Act," "Bad Moms" and more. STX assured employees Wednesday that TPG remains committed to STX, that other TPG executives remain on the board and that McGlashan's board seat will be filled.
The Marin Independent Journal contributed to this report.

NYT adds massive, jarring correction to report that claimed Israel demolished Palestinian communities

Texto completo: The New York Times has corrected an article that falsely reported that Israel had demolished entire Palestinian communities along the West Bank in 2018. In reality, Israeli authorities considered tearing down a few specific homes, none of which were ultimately destroyed.

Other than that, that's some solid work by the Times!

The article, titled “Ilhan Omar’s Criticism Raises the Question: Is Aipac Too Powerful?,” stated originally:

"When Israel demolished Palestinian communities in the West Bank last year, Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, gathered signatures from 76 members of Congress to criticize the move. Aipac was silent. "

The above passage has since been corrected to read:

"When Israel proposed demolishing Palestinian homes in the West Bank last year, Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, gathered signatures from 76 members of Congress to criticize the move. Aipac was silent."

The Times has also affixed an editor’s note to the story and to its corrections page that says [emphasis added]:

"An article on Monday about the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington referred imprecisely to Israel’s activities on the West Bank and a letter from Representative Jan Schakowsky. Israel had proposed demolishing Palestinian homes, not entire communities and had not conducted the demolition. Ms. Schakowsky was objecting to the demolition proposal."

“Referred imprecisely” is such generous characterization for a passage that was 100 percent false. This is the difference between razing Washington's entire Petworth neighborhood on the one hand, and considering but then declining to knock down a handful of its row houses on the other.

Ironically, that’s not the only problem with the article. If the story's headline sounds familiar, that’s because we’ve already tackled one major issue in this Times report. This is the same article that incorrectly portrayed a lone, pro-Israel activist as an “AIPAC activist,” suggesting the man either represented or spoke for the national group in some capacity. In reality, the activist cited by the paper, Stephen Fiske, “has not been associated with the pro-Israel lobbying group for several years,” the Times of Israel reports.

It adds, “The hardball he counsels in dealing with those who depart from centrist pro-Israel orthodoxies is not the style of the lobby, which discourages alienating safe incumbents.” Fiske himself told the Times of Israel in a phone interview that he hasn’t been associated with AIPAC for “three or four years." He also told the same paper he is no longer a member.

Yet, the New York Times reports that Fiske is “a longtime activist with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee,” that “Aipac … managed to harness the passions of thousands of people like Mr. Fiske,” and that "Mr. Fiske’s Florida Congressional Committee is one of a string of political action committees with anodyne names … that operate independently of Aipac but whose missions and membership align with it."

The Times' false citation of Fiske as a supposed AIPAC authority even led Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to claim last week — falsely, but through no fault of her own — that the group is targeting her over her support for anti-Semitic Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. Neither Ocasio-Cortez nor Omar are being targeted by AIPAC, though you’d think otherwise from reading the Times’ coverage.

Serious question: Between the Fiske and “demolished Palestinian communities” errors, at what point does the Times cut its losses and simply retract this story? (h/t Jeryl Bier)

Texto completo: Get ready to be overwhelmed by Cynthia Erivo.
With a voice that brings tears to your eyes and a stage presence that The New York Times described as “incandescent,” the British actress/singer is just an Academy Award away from revered EGOT (Emmy/Grammy/Oscar/Tony winner) status. She earned the E, G and T for her work in the 2015 Broadway revival of “The Color Purple,” winning the acting Tony for portraying the lead character Celie, then a Grammy for the album that was made from the production, and finally a Daytime Emmy after the cast sang on “The Today Show” on NBC.
Erivo, who this weekend will perform love songs from Broadway musicals at a La Pietra Hawaii School for Girls fundraiser and Hawaii Theatre, is herself amazed at her success.
“It definitely still blows me away, actually,” said Erivo, who has a close friend living in Hawaii and visits frequently. “A lot of (the awards) were dreams of mine that I had, and it’s just awesome to be within it and see it all happen all at the same time. I’m just enjoying it, and excited, and making sure I keep up with my work, so that people can keep enjoying it, and I can keep enjoying it, and experiencing it all as it happens. It’s kind of wonderful.”
That Oscar might be on the horizon. Erivo has just finished shooting “Harriet,” a biopic about the abolitionist and political activist Harriet Tubman. A nomination would not be surprising, given her success on film so far – stealing scenes in her first movie, “Widows” with Viola Davis and Michelle Rodriguez, and her second, “Bad Times at the El Royale,” where her a capella versions of “Unchained Melody,” “This Old Heart of Mine” and “Can’t Hurry Love” provided an enchanting, if somewhat spine-tingling counterpart to the gore in the murder mystery.
It’s not just her track record of accomplishment that ensures an intriguing performance from Erivo. She puts everything she has into her craft.
“It was tough and exhilarating and meaningful, very meaningful,” she said of her work on “Harriet.” “There are so many emotional experiences that you have to go through in order to make sure that you’re doing her justice. It was definitely the hardest I’ve worked in a long time. And that is saying a lot, because I like to work hard. But it was an experience I don’t think I’ll ever forget. I think it definitely changed my life and changed me.
“Getting to know her — I knew her already, but getting to experience her, getting to know her like that — it was really special.”
The role has not been without controversy. Erivo may well be the best British import to stage and screen since Julie Andrews, but some have said that the role of Harriet Tubman should have gone to an African American.
Erivo, who is of Nigerian descent and was born and raised in South London, said she has always felt a duty to be well-versed in African-American history and culture.
“Because I’m a black girl, I can’t help but to make it my business to learn about the woman in history who are of color like myself, who have changed the shape of history,” she said.
“Harriet wasn’t new to me. Celie wasn’t new to me. We don’t have the information about women of color out there in the U.K, but we do have information about the women of color from America. Those are our inspirations, the people we look to.
“It extends right into music. The music that we hear, when it comes to R&B and soul – we have loads of artists (of African heritage) in the U.K., but very few of them make it onto the radio. Very few of them are seen in the way American artists are seen in the U.K. … That’s why I know almost the whole catalogue of Aretha Franklin. That’s who I was listening to.”
MUSIC HAS always been a big part of Erivo’s life. She got an inkling of her singing ability as a child, when she sang “Silent Night” at a party and saw how happy it made everyone.
She did not get formal music training until she was a teenager, studying classical singing at first, and enhancing that with her own passion and diligence.
“I was a nosy child who wanted to make sure I could suck up everything I could when it came to music,” Erivo said. “It was a combination of classical training and hunger for music.”
She describes her voice using the operatic term coloratura soprano, but the emotion and vulnerability she puts into her singing seem to surpass any categorization or limitation.
Her role as Celie in “The Color Purple,” who for much of the story is downtrodden and abused, took so much out of her that for awhile she stopped singing “I’m Here,” the musical’s signature song, in concert.
“I believe that if you’re going to sing a song, you have to find the truth in that song, and tell that truth,” she said. “I think I’m lucky enough to be connected to my emotions, connected to my feelings, so that I can connect that with the music and the song and the story I’m telling.”
Some of that understanding comes from her initial career choice, music psychology. She had studied it for a year in college when an advisor urged her to audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of London’s most prestigious schools. She was admitted, and primarily studied acting, but the school allowed her to continue singing.
Erivo still thinks her original studies help inform her performance today, albeit in an unusual way.
“What helped me understand what music psychology was was the way in which people would react to me singing something, or listening to a piece of music,” she said. “I would see that, and the information that I garnered from that was used to help me. It was kind of backwards.”
Despite her crowd-pleasing, award-winning success, Erivo continues to work on all of her talents. She experiments with her silky, four-octave-plus range voice, finding new insights into tonal quality and color.
“I know I have a specific kind of voice, but I’ve always been curious about how far I can take it and what I can do with it,” she said. “I’m always playing around with the sound I can make, so my learning never stops. Every year I find something new that I can do with my voice.
“You know, babies, when they find a new word, it’s like they chew it and find out how many ways they can use that sound, that word. I feel the same about my voice.”

Zirpoli: Trump's tariff and trade war is failing

Texto completo: Ford Motor Company recently reported a $1 billion drop in profits directly related to tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. In response, they announced major layoffs of around 12 percent of their workforce. Ford CEO Jim Hackett, in an interview with Bloomberg News, stated that Trump’s tariffs on imported aluminum and steel alone were largely responsible for the decline.
Ford is not the only car company hurting because of Trump’s tariffs. Paul Eisenstein at the Detroit Bureau of Reuters writes that 276,000 vehicles made in the United States were shipped to China in 2018. But the trade war between the U.S. and China has impacted these sales. After Trump announced tariffs against Chinese goods, Eisenstein noted that “Customs agents in Shanghai have refused to release a shipment of American-made Mercedes-Benz SUVs because of what they have described as a ‘safety risk.’” Joe Phillippi, a Wall Street automotive analyst, stated: “This, unfortunately, appears to be part of a tit-for-tat in an escalating trade war, and it could reach crazy levels.”
As noted by Eisenstein, the tariff war with China is hurting “the industrial heartland” of America the most, where these vehicles are made. For example, says Eisenstein, because of the tariffs, Ford has had to add thousands of dollars to the base price of a Ford Mustang. American consumers are paying for Trump’s tariffs, not China. Mary Papenfuss, writing for Huffington Post, found that “President Donald Trump’s trade war cost American businesses and consumers $3 billion a month last year in higher prices” citing a study by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York in partnership with Princeton and Columbia Universities. Trump once said that “trade wars are good and easy to win.” But American car manufacturers and farmers are having a difficult time finding anything good in Trump’s trade policies.
BMW is the largest exporter of vehicles to China and the new tariffs have hurt them the most. BMW has its largest plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Before the new tariffs, BMW announced a $1 billion expansion of the plant creating 1,100 new jobs. But the tariffs have put all of that growth and hiring into question.
Farmers have been hit especially hard. In an interview with PBS News, Iowa farmer Howard Hill said that his 7,000 pigs are selling for less than it cost to raise them. Retaliatory tariffs on American farm exports have contributed to a 12 percent drop in net farm income in 2018, according to the PBS report.
It seems that Trump is confused about how tariffs work when he says things like: “China is paying the U.S. billions of dollars in tariffs” or, as he tweeted on Feb. 16, “Billions of dollars are being paid to the United States by China in the form of Trade Tariffs.” Has anyone explained to the president that his tariffs on imported goods are paid for by American companies who pass the cost on to American consumers?
Worst of all, the tariffs have failed to achieve Trump’s major objective: lower the trade deficit with China and other nations. According to the U.S. Commerce Department and reported by Jim Tankersley and Ana Swanson of The New York Times last week, “America’s trade deficit in goods with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history” to $891 billion in 2018. This included a record $419 billion deficit with China, $169 billion with the European Union, $82 billion deficit with Mexico and $20 billion with Canada.
Tankersley and Swanson called the growing trade deficits “a case of textbook economics catching up with some of Mr. Trump’s unorthodox economic policies.” For example, they reported, “Stiff tariffs on Chinese goods help slow China’s economy, crimping American exports, which declined nearly 50 percent in December from the same month a year ago.” Fewer exports to China, a major buyer of American goods, especially farmers who sell food to China, is bad business for American businesses and farmers. Trump’s efforts to hurt China’s economy have backfired on American businesses and farmers.
While Trump has convinced many Americans that trade deficits with other nations are bad for our economy, others have tried to explain to him that these trade deficits reflect the fact that Americans have more money and purchasing power than poorer nations. Richer nations, like the United States, tend to buy more and import more. It means that we have a stronger economy. Poorer countries tend to buy less and import less. Trump does not seem to understand this basic economic reality. Worse, he does not seem to understand how his tariffs have disrupted the supply lines and increased costs for the American automobile industry while decreasing exports for many American businesses and farmers.

Southwest Key CEO Sanchez to retire

Texto completo: The board of directors for the Austin-based Southwest Key Programs, the nation’s largest provider of facilities for detaining migrant children on behalf of the Trump administration, announced Monday that its founder and CEO Juan Sanchez will retire.
“Recent events have convinced me that Southwest Key would benefit from a fresh perspective and new leadership,” Sanchez said in a statement. “Widespread misunderstanding of our business and unfair criticism of our people has become a distraction our employees do not deserve. It’s time for new beginnings.”
The organization’s chief operating officer, Joella Brooks, will be the interim
CEO while the company searches for a new leader, board chairman Orlando Martinez said in a statement.
“In consultation with Dr. Sanchez, the board believes it’s time to begin a new chapter at Southwest Key,” Martinez said. “Our mission has never been more critical than it is today, and we must look carefully at what is required to evolve and grow as an organization. The board is immensely grateful for Dr. Sanchez’s drive and determination to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of children.”
The nonprofit did not say when Sanchez will retire.
Sanchez founded Southwest Key Programs in 1987 and is one of the highest-paid nonprofit executives in the country. The nonprofit collects hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to run facilities along the southern border. Southwest Key operates two dozen shelters for migrant children in Texas, Arizona and California. It also offers education and counseling programs for children and runs charter schools, including East Austin College Prep Academy.
Southwest Key came under fire as the Trump administration detained more immigrants and conducted large-scale separations of families last year, pushing children into the organization’s facilities without their parents’ consent. At least one facility in South Texas served as a “tender-age” shelter for toddlers with cribs and other supplies.
According to government data obtained by The Associated Press, the number of children held by Southwest Key grew to around 5,000 at a time last year, including about 1,400 at an old Walmart in Brownsville. Southwest Key received $523 million in government funding from January to September.
In June, a protest outside Sanchez’s house in Austin called on him to stop housing migrant families. Last month, a woman climbed the walls of the Southwest Key headquarters in East Austin and stayed there for eight hours to protest the same issue.
Sanchez told the American-Statesman last year that the nonprofit considered ending its relationship with the federal government over Trump’s “zero tolerance policy,” but in the end decided against it, saying it would help the children who had been separated by continuing its work.
Unlike the Border Patrol’s facilities where migrants are usually first detained, Southwest Key’s facilities typically have dormitory-style sleeping areas, classrooms and playgrounds.
Children remain at the facilities until the government can place them in foster care or with an adult sponsor, typically a relative. The Department of Health and Human Services said the average stay for children in government facilities was 60 days.
The New York Times reported in December that federal prosecutors were examining Southwest Key’s finances, and the paper’s investigation said the nonprofit “stockpiled taxpayer dollars and possibly engaged in self-dealing with top executives.”

Texto completo: NEW YORK - I couldn't be less chill, not after sitting through the insipid "Be More Chill" for the second time. I saw it last year off-Broadway, a perch on which it landed by virtue of the mad crush many young folk developed for a cast recording that streamed online long before a New York engagement was ever in the works.
It is, in that sense, the first musical to click its way onto Broadway, where it had its official opening at the Lyceum Theatre on Sunday. And, boy, were my misgivings from my initial encounter confirmed. "Be More Shrill" would be a better title for director Stephen Brackett's heinously overamplified and overacted production, built on the story of a nerd played by the intrepid Will Roland, who takes a magic pill to become popular with the high school "in" crowd.
With "Mean Girls," "Dear Evan Hansen" and "The Prom" already exploring in up-tempo dance numbers the vicissitudes of outcast adolescents, "Be More Chill" enters Broadway's highest-occupancy lane, in the clunkiest vehicle of them all. You get the feeling that Joe Iconis's score - with lyrics often resorting to doggerel - and Joe Tracz's satire-laced book might have retained some measure of charm in less hyperventilating style and more intimate surroundings.
As it is, though, "Be More Chill" is delivered in such relentlessly breathless fashion that every song in the program list of musical numbers should be hashtagged #OMGOMGOMG. Yes, we know, high schoolers live secretly or out loud in hysterical, anxiety-ridden overdrive. But 2 1/2 hours of teenage insecurities turned into pop opéra bouffe make for a patience-trying endurance test for all but the most tolerant observers.
"Be More Chill" was born in 2015 in a production at a New Jersey theater that drew critical yawns, but the cast album became a sensation, streaming more than 100 million times in the United States, according to the New York Times. What else could a group of enterprising producers do but try to capitalize on that magnitude of fan intensity? The show's Faustian underpinnings concern the questionable inroads with his peers made by Roland's Jeremy. They're activated after he swallows the pill that unlocks a "Matrix"-adjacent computer entity played by Jason Tam. It is this silly contrivance that guides Jeremy's increasingly callous behavior. (Roland, it should be noted, was an original cast member of the far, far superior "Dear Evan Hansen.")
But more than in its wish-fulfillment premise, "Be More Chill's" power may derive from a certain facile cheesiness: an intentional insincerity in which some subset of theatergoers can indulge a callow notion of sophistication that says trust nothing - and certainly, least of all, the falseness of theater.
That conceit, though, probably plays better in a high school auditorium than a Broadway theater. My preview audience seemed a bit mystified by the enthusiasm generated in some quarters that has paved the way to this unveiling in the big time. In the Lyceum, you could feel the chill.

For a growing number of Americans, socialism is OK

Texto completo: You wouldn’t expect democratic socialists to hit the brakes when it comes to social justice.
But in late February members of Inland Empire Democratic Socialists of America learned how to fix brake lights so they could offer that bit of auto repair service, for free, at an upcoming community event. Working tail lights, they reasoned, would mean fewer police traffic stops and, possibly, fewer fatal outcomes for people of color.
Auto repair is just one part of the chapter’s public outreach about an ideology that, increasingly, is finding a more receptive public audience. Polling shows more Americans, especially Democrats, view socialism more favorably than capitalism, even if they have sometimes wildly different ideas of what socialism is.
“It just doesn’t have the same stigma,” Kimberley Coles, a political anthropologist at the University of Redlands, said of the word “socialism.”
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be … rhetoric and seeing what sticks in terms of the insults.”
A Gallup poll from last summer found that for the first time in 10 years, Democrats had a more positive view of socialism (57 percent) than they did of capitalism (45 percent). That shift among Democrats drove down the overall view of capitalism.
“A majority of Americans have retained a positive view of capitalism over the past eight years, but this year’s 56% positive rating is by four points the lowest recorded since 2010,” Gallup reported. “Americans’ positive views of socialism have varied only between 35% and 39%, with (2018’s) reading of 37% right at the trend average.”
Gallup also found that among young people (ages 18 to 29) capitalism had slipped from 68 percent approval in 2010 to 45 percent approval last year.
Gallup isn’t the only pollster seeing that trend.
Thirty-one percent of Democrats in a YouGov poll from last August said they would be “comfortable” with a socialist presidential candidate, compared to just 8 percent for Republicans.
The same YouGov poll found 44 percent of Americans had a favorable view of capitalism, down from 52 percent in 2015. Americans age 18 through 29 are likelier to see the word “socialist” as a compliment while Americans age 65 and older are more likely to consider it an insult, although the 65-and-up group views socialism more favorably now (25 percent) than in 2015 (15 percent), according to YouGov.
Capitalism’s polling dip — and the corresponding rise in approval for the label “socialism” — coincides with ballot box gains by politicians who are connected with the political organization Democratic Socialists of America.
Running as Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2018 became the first Democratic Socialists of America members to win congressional seats. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected 2016 presidential campaign fueled an effort to turn the Democratic Party leftward, a trend that’s continued with Ocasio-Cortez’s celebrity status.
Nationally, Democratic Socialists of America had just 5,000 members prior to November 2016, but passed the 40,000-member mark following Ocasio-Cortez’s upset in New York’s June 2018 primary, according to published reports.
The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

Texto completo: Priscilla Villarreal es una reportera sobre cuatro ruedas: hace lo que ella llama “noticias en movimiento” desde su “demonio azul” , la camioneta con la que recorre las calles de la fronteriza ciudad de Laredo, Texas . Su forma de hacer periodismo es novedosa ya que combina todas las posibilidades que brinda Facebook y, a la vez, cuenta en espanglish historias que pueden ser de utilidad para sus más de 120 000 seguidores (y sumando).
Hija de migrantes mexicanos, Lagordiloca , como se hace llamar en la red social, nació en Estados Unidos hace 34 años. Después de dejar la escuela a temprana edad, tuvo varios trabajos, el último de ellos en un desguace para el que recogía chatarra de tráileres inservibles. Desde 2015, su trabajo como reportera de exclusivas locales ha dado un giro a su vida ya que, según dijo al diario New York Times, le ha ayudado a superar los problemas de depresión y estrés postraumático que venía sufriendo tras la pérdida prematura de su bebé hace alrededor de diez años.
Con una forma desenfadada y directa de contar las noticias, Villarreal informa sobre accidentes de tráfico, redadas policiales o crímenes locales . También ha contadado en primicia temas relacionados con corruptelas en el seno de las autoridades policiales de su ciudad, que han supuesto incluso su detención en un debate sobre los límites de la libertad de expresión del que salió airosa .
Junto con la información, comparte también su opinión sobre el caso y envuelve todo en un ya característico tono de “chisme” . “Yo hablo el lenguaje de las calles y por eso la gente me sigue” – reconoció en una entrevista. En su página de Facebook también se ven artículos de otros medios y recomendaciones de sus lugares favoritos . La pequeña cantidad de ingresos que recibe de los restaurantes que frecuenta le permite continuar con su carrera como reportera.
Los videos en directo por Facebook son su canal estrella de comunicación. Los empieza con un recurrente “¡Qué rollo!” y, a través de ellos, revela las exclusivas, cuenta en pantalla lo que está sucediendo e, incluso, habla de su vida personal y responde al momento a los comentarios de sus seguidores . Por todo ello, no ha tardado en hacerse popular y ha cosechado un gran número de fans -que la paran por la calle para pedirle fotos y autógrafos- pero tambien algunos haters -que critican su aspecto físico o su forma de hacer comunicación.
Villarreal admitió al New York Time que a quien más miedo tiene es a la policía . Y es que el departamento policial de Laredo la tiene en el punto de mira. Según Daxton Stewart -de la Universidad Cristiana de Texas, en su página se publica información que las autoridades no quieren que vean la luz .
En 2017 Priscila Villarreal informó -con nombre y apellidos- del suicidio de un agente de la oficina de aduanas y control de fronteras (CPB , por sus siglas en inglés). Por esta noticia la arrestaron, acusada de delito de tercer grado por uso incorrecto de la información . Antes de este arresto, una oficial de policía había sido suspendida de sus funciones durante 20 días , por considerar que era ella quien suministraba información a Lagordiloca .
Los cargos hacia la reportera fueron desestimados al poco tiempo y, lejos de debilitarla, le otorgaron mayor visibilidad en la comunidad y la acercaron a nuevas fuentes de información .
La popularidad de Lagordiloca crece a pasos agigantados, ya no solo en la pequeña ciudad de Ladero (de 260 000 habitantes) sino también en todo el territorio nacional. Su camioneta, la música de banda y (a veces su madre) son sus mejores compeñeras. Con su trabajo está proponiendo un modo de hacer periodismo que se adapta a su público y a las posibilidades tecnológicas de estos tiempos .

Commentary: America’s costly and futile war

Texto completo: "America would be more secure and stronger economically if we recognized that we have largely achieved our objectives in Afghanistan and moved aggressively to bring our troops and tax dollars home," Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) write in an op-ed article. "Today, despite vast investment in training and equipping Afghan forces, the country's deep-seated instability, rampant corruption and, in some cases, compromised loyalties endure. Extending our commitment of combat troops will not remedy that situation."
The senators are right, just as they were right eight years ago when they penned those words for the New York Times with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). In the near-decade since, the White House has gained a new occupant from a different party, congressional control has shifted and the United States' 17-year Afghan war has been governed by ostensibly new strategies implemented by six different commanders. But the U.S. stalemate in Afghanistan remains fundamentally the same: The war is still a costly and futile project that does nothing to serve U.S. interests or move Afghanistan meaningfully toward political reconciliation or peace.
So little has changed in eight years that Paul and Udall last week introduced legislation that nearly duplicates their 2011 push for withdrawal. The 2019 American Forces Going Home After Noble (AFGHAN) Service Act has updated numbers -- higher counts of U.S. troops killed or wounded, and a larger tally of borrowed tax dollars spent and often wasted -- but its core demand for a quick and responsible exit from the longest war in U.S. history is unaltered.
All the senators' arguments against the war in Afghanistan -- that it is a reckless strategic failure that benefits no one -- are no less applicable now than they were in 2011. Just as then, those against withdrawal show no sign of ever wanting this war to end. And once again, Paul and Udall are faced with a president who has promised to bring American forces home but refused to commit to any reasonably expeditious timeline.
That stagnation is a telling indictment of what passes for foreign policy in Washington. Too many policymakers seem incapable, if not unwilling, of considering the big picture, of asking whether continuing this war is in any sense good, useful, or even in conformity with the will of the people they ostensibly represent. There is plenty of energy for fiddling with the details -- a few thousand more troops here, a new infrastructure project there, drone and other aerial strikes scaled up or down or back up again, with civilian casualty rates following suit.
But in the task of adjusting anything more substantive than tactics in Afghanistan, Washington is generally content with stalemate or slow loss. A war undertaken right after 9/11 has devolved into a generational conflict; it is now being fought by soldiers born after the terrorist attack that precipitated it. And though, according to an October study from the Charles Koch Institute, 57 percent of Americans -- and 7 in 10 veterans -- support a full U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, our government has no such clarity.
President Trump, like President Obama before him, campaigned on shuttering reckless wars of choice, lambasting mission creep and the ineffectual nation building it so often entails. Yet neither president has succeeded in pushing past the inertia of what's been called the foreign policy "blob" -- the Washington establishment who, as one pundit put it, "whine ceaselessly about the collapse of the American security order."
While the rest of the country is past ready to move on, the locus of Washington's foreign policy conversation about Afghanistan (and our half a dozen other conflicts in the Mideast and North Africa) is about the scale at which military intervention should continue forever, not whether it should continue at all.
A less narrow and more realistic assessment makes evident what Paul, Udall and other voices crying in Washington's wilderness contend: There is no U.S.-imposed, militarily enforced solution to Afghanistan's woes, and indefinitely prolonging our occupation cannot and will not change that. Our government is trying to bomb and spend Afghanistan into a political order that can only be achieved by those who must live with the outcomes, both through promising (if still uncertain) diplomatic efforts led by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and through conversations among various factions of the Afghan people themselves.
Whatever course and time frame those negotiations may take, the business at hand for Washington remains the same: U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan must come to an end. It would be an appalling -- if not exactly shocking -- state of affairs if this point must still be made another eight years hence.

Heedlessness contributing to deficits

Texto completo: Republicans hate deficits. Or at least that's what they claim.
Republicans in Congress spent the entire Obama administration inveighing against budget deficits, warning incessantly that we were going to have a Greek-style fiscal crisis any day now. Donald Trump, on the other hand, focused his ire mainly on trade deficits, insisting that "our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us."
But over two years of unified GOP control of government, a funny thing happened: Both deficits surged. The budget deficit has hit a level unprecedented except during wars and in the immediate aftermath of major economic crises; the trade deficit in goods has set a record.
What's the significance of this tide of red ink?
Let's be clear: Neither the budget deficit nor the trade deficit poses a clear and present danger to the U.S. economy. Advanced countries that borrow in their own currencies can and often do run up large debts without drastic consequences - which is why the debt panic of a few years ago was always nonsense.
Yet Trump's twin deficits tell us a lot about both the tweeter in chief and his party - namely, that they're both dishonest and ignorant.
About the dishonesty: Is there anyone left who believes that Republicans ever really cared about debt and deficits? 
In any case, at this point it's undeniable that their fire-and-brimstone debt rhetoric was nothing but a pose, an attempt to weaponize the deficit as a way to block and undermine President Barack Obama's agenda.
The moment they had a chance, the very politicians who grandstanded about the need for fiscal responsibility rammed through a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy - a tax cut that is the main reason for the exploding budget deficit.
What about the ignorance? As many people have pointed out to no avail, Trump is all wrong about what trade deficits do. True, at times of high unemployment deficits can cost us jobs. But in normal times they don't reduce overall employment, nor do they make us poorer.
On the contrary, other countries are sending us valuable goods and services, which we're paying for with pieces of paper - paper that pays very low interest rates. Who's winning, again?
In the Trumpian universe, trade deficits happen because we made bad deals - we let foreigners sell their stuff here, but they won't let us sell our stuff there. So the solution is to throw up barriers to foreign products. "I am a Tariff Man," he proudly proclaimed.
The reality, however, is that trade deficits have almost nothing to do with tariffs or other restrictions on trade. The overall trade deficit is always equal to the difference between domestic investment spending and domestic saving (both private and public).
The reason America runs persistent trade deficits isn't that we've given away too much in trade deals, it's that we have low savings compared with other countries.
Tariffs can, of course, reduce imports of the goods subject to the tariff, and hence reduce the trade deficit in that particular industry. But it's like pushing on a balloon: You can squeeze it in one place, but it will just inflate by the same amount somewhere else. 
Sure enough, the Trump tariffs of 2018 did, in fact, lead to a sharp fall in imports of the goods subjected to tariffs. But imports of other goods rose, while exports performed poorly. And the overall trade deficit went up substantially.
Trump also keeps insisting that foreigners are paying his tariffs. In reality, prices received by foreign exporters haven't gone down. Prices paid by U.S. consumers have gone up, instead.
Again, the swelling trade deficit doesn't pose any immediate threat to the U.S. economy. And even the Trumpian trade war has probably done only limited economic harm; the main damage is to U.S. credibility.
Paul Krugman writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: Omar El Akkad brings his powerful dystopian novel American War — and himself — to Rochester later this month for four days of readings, book signings and other appearances.
The 413-page book, which explores a future United States devastated by climate change, political upheaval, a decimated population and a plague, is the Writers & Books' selection for Rochester Reads 2019.
American War has been called "alarmingly real" by The New York Times and was listed by a number of magazines and newspapers as one of the best books of 2017.
"I'm not particularly interested in the idea of apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic writing so much as mid-apocalyptic," says El Akkad, whose experience as a journalist in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, Egypt and elsewhere informed the fictional universe he created.
"Mostly," he adds, "I wanted to talk about this idea of what do you do when you're in a situation like an insurgency, or a cold war, where there seems to be no beginning or end."
We talked with El Akkad about how American War has been received, the role of literature, and what comes next.
This is a haunting read. Did you find yourself having to get into a particular place mentally each time you sat down to write?
It's a stone-cold bummer of a book. I wish I had a better way of describing it; "haunting" is a polite way of saying that. It was a difficult book to write, but there was something cathartic about taking all these residual memories of things I'd experienced as a journalist and putting them down on paper. I always approached it as a chance to get rid of certain emotional components of those assignments. I'd plotted out the entire book in advance, so I needed to steel myself when I was coming to a difficult section.
Your book has been called "prescient." What's your take on that?
I didn't set out trying to predict anybody's future. One of the really strange things that started to happen when it came out in hardcover in April 2017, a few months into the Trump administration, is that a lot of the book which lives in my mind as a kind of metaphorical or allegorical thing started being taken very literally. The book has shown up on at least a couple of lists of novels you need to read in the Trump era. That's been a really surreal experience.
What have been some of your most interesting reactions from readers?
The most thoughtful reactions I've gotten, both positive and negative, have come from people who've served in the military. It's been really interesting to have discussions with people who've been on the other side of these wars, in Afghanistan, in Iraq. One of the defining aspects of America's recents wars is this kind of distance — they tend to happen on the other side of the planet; we tend to see drone footage that feels like it's out of a video game — and these are people who've breached that distance. I've also talked to a couple of people who have said the book has given them a new perspective on how somebody becomes radicalized.
You've said you view literature as a kind of "weaponized empathy." Please elaborate.
The closest I've come to getting at the core of what I think literature does is this notion of it being both the lighthouse and the storm. It moves you to a place where you can comfortably avoid going to otherwise, and it illuminates that place. Literature says, "Here's an experience you otherwise would not have had. Sit with it."
A lot of research went into the world you built for this story. Aside from your previous work as a journalist, what went into that process?
I had to do a lot of reading on the Civil War to find analogy points, because I went to school in the British system in the Middle East, and all I knew was through tropes and clichés and snippets through popular culture. So that was about a year of reading. I spent a lot of time traveling through the South, sometimes on assignments for my newspaper at the time, sometimes on trips I took of my own volition. I drove through the landscape, deliberately looking for places I could superimpose the story onto. Readers already know what they think and feel and know about New York City, and for a book that's going to overlay a second Civil War and future dystopia on top of the landscape, I wanted to go to these places that didn't have that baggage — and by the end of my life probably aren't going to exist. A lot of southern Louisiana is probably not going to be land anymore in a few decades' time. I wanted to be sure I experienced these places as closely as possible before they quite literally disappear.
In your interactions with readers, what have they most wanted to know?
The ending is what a lot of people ask me about — this notion that you have this human being who has experienced immense damage but toward the end of the book is given a route, if not to salvation, a relatively peaceful life, and chooses at the last minute not to take it. It throws a lot of people off and is a difficult thing to come to terms with. It was for me, too. I knew where this was ending and I didn't want to go there, but I couldn't have written this book and have it end any other way.
You're continuing to write, but not that eager to put all of your work out there. Why?
I don't believe that everything I put down on paper has to go out into the world. I write because it's the only thing I know how to do well, and it's the only time I feel in control of my story and my surroundings and my place in this world. And that is a deeply personal reason to write. Writing and publishing are two entirely different things. I'm fortunate enough to be married to a human being who's a grown-up who has a grown-up job and can put food on the table. The only reason I tried to put out American War as opposed to the three novels I wrote before is because I felt I had something necessary to say. I do have a short story in the literary magazine Guernica coming out on March 25, and in February I was part of an anthology called A People's Future of the United States, a collection of speculative fiction about possible futures of this country.
What do you want readers to take away from the book?
I subscribe to the notion that once the book goes out into the world, it doesn't matter in the slightest what the writer thinks the book is about. That being said, I hope it's seen as a defense of gray space, a defense of nuance. You can understand another human being even when they go to a very dark place, and you don't have to take their side to do so.

Texto completo: COLUMBIA – As spring approaches, it's easy to spot Bradford pear trees bursting with white blooms that brighten the South Carolina landscape.
But these harbingers of spring have an evil side that is so vile they should be eliminated, state foresters say.
The S.C. Forestry Commission is encouraging people who own vacant, wooded land to cut down every Bradford pear tree on their property, while asking folks in town to stop planting the prolific pear trees in yards.
Why?
Bradford pear trees are growing like weeds, spreading into forests and crowding out native trees in some places, the commission says. When these trees grow in natural forests, they create dense thickets, replete with sharp thorns, that make walking through the woods difficult. The thorns are so sharp and sturdy that they can puncture tractor tires.
More importantly, Bradford pears threaten native species and the quality of wood that might be harvested for paper and wood production, according to the Forestry Commission.
The trees also are brittle and spindly, meaning their branches easily break during high winds and storms, leaving cities littered with woody debris. The trees can even smell bad at times, according to the Forestry Commission. Some reports have likened the smell to that of dead fish.
"We are saying cut them down when possible," Forestry Commission spokesman Doug Wood said. "It is just generally a nuisance tree."
Introduced in the U.S. from Asia, these pear trees became a landscaping tree of choice beginning in the 1960s and lasting through the early 2000s.
The trees were thought to be sterile so they would not spread and cause problems for native trees. But that hasn't proven to be true. Beginning in the late 1990s, Bradford pears began producing fruit. Birds that eat the fruit of Bradford pears spread the seeds in their droppings, leading to stands of Bradford pears in forests, Wood and commission officials said.
Bradford pears are among scores of invasive plant species that are causing problems in South Carolina, experts say. The state is being overrun with certain types of nonnative plant species and animals, such as coyotes and armadillos.
Rick Woodley, who runs Woodley's Garden Center in Columbia, said Bradford pears once were popular for landscaping, but he is reluctant to sell them now.
"We don't carry the typical Bradford pear unless somebody is just asking for it," he said. " There are more things that are more hardy and protect the environment better."
The fast growing trees can reach 50 feet tall, with bushy canopies that spread up to 30 feet, according to Clemson University.
Cities, such as Columbia, are replacing Bradford pears they planted years ago with other species, Woodley said.
"I don't know anybody that really says 'I'm just a fan of Bradford pears,' " Woodley said. "If you see them in the landscape, they are just horrible. These thunderstorms get into them and they look terrible."
Some people liken Bradford pears to kudzu, the leafy Asian vine that has spread throughout the South.
Others say Bradford pears are like the fictional monster "Frankenstein" because they were not expected to be a problem by those who cultivated and planted them. A 2018 story in The Washington Post said the Bradford pear shows how even the smartest "scientific minds can go blind to what they might be creating, long after they have gone."
The Bradford pear, however, still has defenders. The trees provide the spring's first color every year, while turning a brilliant red during the fall. In South Carolina, they often retain their leaves until early winter, then bloom again a few weeks later. And they help soak up carbon dioxide that worsens global warming, some say.
In a 2018 opinion letter to The New York Times, blogger and science writer Gabriel Popkin said outrage about Bradford pears is overblown.
"Whatever the tree's faults, it's a living, respirating, photosynthesizing plant," he wrote. "It still makes shade on a hot day. It still sucks carbon dioxide out of the air. It still stops rainwater from pounding the soil and running off into sewers.."
The Forestry Commission's Wood said he doesn't dispute that, but the commission believes they still are a problem.
"The Bradford pear is like the abortion debate or religion," he said. "You have got some who are classically, eternally devoted to this tree. Others recognize its invasive nature."

Easton to amp up middle school computer science

Texto completo: Easton Area School District officials want to change the makeup of their high school computer science courses, which are overwhelmingly male and white.
Their solution: bring more computer science to all middle school students in the hopes a more diverse group of students will choose to study it in high school.
Easton Area middle schoolers now get one 42-minute period of computers for 24 days, as part of a rotation that includes art, music, gym and other specialties. With computers, the students focus on typing, documents and spreadsheets.
But that could change next year, when officials plan to roll out a more robust computer science course that will teach students the basics about coding, web design and computing concepts.
The district received a $35,000 state grant for the program. Students exposed to computer science in middle school, they reason, will be more likely to stick with it in high school. Today 75 percent of high school computer science students are male, and 57 percent are white.
District officials looked at those numbers and decided they could do better, said Ryan Cron, the district's director of secondary teaching and learning.
"Everyone goes through these computer rotations at the middle school," he said, so "why aren't we ... having more females or diversity when they get to the high school?
"What it comes down to is they don't have that exposure," Cron said.
Knowledge of computer science can help students get good-paying jobs. There are a half-million open computing jobs in the U.S., according to a recent episode of "60 Minutes" that looked at the gender gap in the tech industry. States are starting to hear the message, and on Feb. 28, West Virginia became the first state to add computer science to its list of graduation requirements.
In February, The New York Times reported on a decline of women writing computer code. In 1960, women made up 27 percent of the computing and mathematical professions, according to the story. Their representation peaked at 35 percent in 1990 and dropped to 26 percent in 2013. The story pinpointed 1984 as the year women started to get pushed out of programming; with the advent of personal computers, boys tinkered around with them and were encouraged by their parents. As the stereotype of the 24/7 programmer developed, some female and minority students became "besieged by doubts" and opted for something else, according to the story.
The stories struck a chord within Easton, Cron said.
Currently, the middle school computer science curriculum is simple: sixth-graders learn typing, seventh-graders get an introduction into the Google suite (like Google documents and sheets), and eighth-graders learn about Microsoft Word and Excel, basic writing and spreadsheet programs.
Cron expects to change things up next year, with sixth-graders taking just a week of typing and then learning the Google suite, seventh-graders continuing with the Google suite and getting an introduction to coding as well as computer science principles, and eighth-graders focused on coding, apps, web development and game development.
With the grant, the district will train at least four teachers and purchase equipment.
Easton High School computer science teacher Carol Carmichael worked in the industry before she switched to teaching in 2004. She teaches computer science discoveries, which introduces students to concepts, coding and problem solving, and AP computer science principles, an introduction to higher level courses.
She said the gender divide in her classes used to be worse. This year she has one class with 11 girls and 10 boys, but that's the exception, not the rule.
During a Kids Who Code camp at Easton for first- through sixth-graders, she said, there will be as many if not more girls participating in first and second grade. But as the students age, the girls drop out.
"This grant ... is hopefully going to help at least with the gender gap, and also get computer science throughout all the underrepresented minorities," she said.
"If every student takes a little bit of computer science at the middle school, they're being exposed to something, like 'Hey, I never really thought about this. I can do this, I think I want to try more of this.' "
She and Cron hope the district can get computer science to even younger students in the future.

Don’t blame the rain for deaths at Santa Anita, the problem is much more complicated

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season. Under the new rules, Santa Anita will scrutinize horses’ medical records — even during training — and control the number of horses on the track for high-speed exercises.
On Saturday, Santa Anita announced its main dirt track would reopen at 5 a.m. Monday for limited workouts — “joggers and gallopers” only.
“Over the past four days, we’ve been able to do a great deal in terms of amending the soil and inspecting it,” said Dennis Moore, who served as track superintendent at Santa Anita until Dec. 31 and recently returned to analyze the racing surfaces.
“Things can happen even under perfect circumstances,” Moore said, “but from everything we’ve been able to learn, this track is in outstanding condition and it’s ready for training.”
Santa Anita’s fixes mirror successful changes made by the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, which cut back on horses on the track in the mornings and tightened up its inspections in the aftermath of a disastrous 2016 summer season, with 17 deaths in 23 days.
Experts: Overuse of track a factor
The increased traffic at Santa Anita is likely one of the main factors in the deaths, according to experts.
Bad weather can upset the consistency of a track, but it also forces horses into the barns, sometimes for days, according to Richard Tedesco, a veteran track consultant with experience as a superintendent at most of Southern California’s racetracks.
Disruptions make trainers and owners anxious to get their horses back out as soon as possible. Once the gates reopen, there’s a flood of horses all at once on a track already weakened by rains.
“You’ve got all of these guys foaming at the mouth to get their horse ready again,” Tedesco said. “The dirt gets pretty well chewed up.”
Too many horses running at the same time is an accident waiting to happen, he said.
Santa Anita shut its track down for two days at the end of February in response to outcry over the first 19 deaths. Track expert Mick Peterson, of the University of Kentucky’s Agricultural Equine Programs, examined and cleared the course as “100 percent ready” before the track reopened Feb. 28.
The horse racing statistics website Equibase tracked 862 workouts in the six days following the reopening. On March 1, 326 horses hit the track before the afternoon races began. Then another 70 ran in those events. The 20th horse died in a race the next day. On March 5, 273 horses worked on the track where the 21st horse died.
“That’s quite a bit,” Tedesco said of the workouts. He estimates an average day is about 150 horses.
In Europe, horses exercise at training centers and race mostly on the weekends, Tedesco said. But in Southern California, the loss of venues has condensed much of the thoroughbred racing to Santa Anita. Trainers say they don’t change locations as often as they did in the past.
Santa Anita scaled up and extended its season when Hollywood Park closed in 2013.
“The bulk of the dates went to Santa Anita,” said Jack Liebau, the director of Los Alamitos Thoroughbred Racing in Orange County. “You have a lot more stress on the track and it’s difficult.”
‘Real art form’ to maintain a track
Heavy rains, a well-worn track, and even the loss of Moore as track superintendent may have all played a part, Liebau said.
Moore, who most recently has been serving as a consultant at Del Mar and Los Alamitos, helped Del Mar with its crisis in 2016. He returned to Santa Anita as a consultant earlier this month to help with the track inspections.
“It’s a real art form to maintain a track in a safe manner,” Liebau said. “Everybody seems to be very happy that Dennis is back.”
Fewer deaths at Los Alamitos
At Los Alamitos Race Course, which runs quarter horses and thoroughbreds, 10,354 horses raced last year, compared to 8,922 at Santa Anita, according to statistics compiled from reports by the CHRB.
Los Alamitos also uses a dirt main track, like Santa Anita, and in the past three months experienced heavier rain. At both venues, the track is tightly compacted to keep out moisture. This creates another potential risk as the harder-than-expected surface can throw off a horse’s fragile footing.
Since Dec. 26, only three horses have died on the track at Los Alamitos, compared to the 21 at Santa Anita. That’s despite the fact that the state’s data shows Los Alamitos had 23 percent more deaths per year on average in the past decade.
Though the tracks share similarities, the big difference between the two venues is the daily traffic. Nine of Santa Anita’s 21 deaths occurred during training on the dirt track, seven were during races. The other five happened on the venue’s storied turf track.
Los Alamitos has added more thoroughbred racing in recent years, but the majority of horses at the venue are quarter horses. These sprinters of the racing world have less intensive training regimens than thoroughbreds, Santa Anita’s bread and butter.
Los Alamitos had less than 200 workouts in the same six day period as Santa Anita’s 862, according to Equibase.
‘Everybody worried’
Last week, the New York Times reported that trainers at Santa Anita appear to be more demanding than counterparts elsewhere in the state. Santa Anita averages 3.02 workouts per start, compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York.
“Ninety-nine percent of the trainers take very good care of their horses, there’s less than 1 percent that you have to watch,” said Tedesco, the track consultant. “Owners spend a lot of money, the trainers want to win races. It all comes down to, ‘Let’s keep them going.’ “
Everyone at the track is working to ensure safety of horses during training and the races, he said. Tedesco said he’s fielded concerned calls from racetrack officials across the country..
“What is going on is really bad for the industry,” he said. “It’s gotten everybody worried, everywhere.”

It's inhumane to execute someone too impaired to recall crime

Texto completo: In a series of rulings over the past several decades interpreting the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Court has prohibited the execution of some of the most helpless people in the nation, including children and people with intellectual disabilities.
On Wednesday, the court spared from execution Vernon Madison, who cannot remember the circumstances surrounding his 1985 conviction in Alabama for the murder of a police officer. Mr. Madison suffered at least two severe strokes after his conviction, and his lawyers had told the justices that he had vascular dementia and attendant cognitive decline.
As Justice Elena Kagan explained in a 5-to-3 decision siding with Mr. Madison, a faulty memory alone does not trigger the protections of the Eighth Amendment, just as the diagnosis of a mental illness alone would not. Instead, Justice Kagan wrote, what's relevant is whether the person possesses a "rational understanding" of why the state wants to impose the ultimate punishment. (Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who hadn't yet been confirmed when the court first heard the dispute, did not participate in Mr. Madison's case.)
In prior cases laying the foundation for this principle, the Supreme Court justices have reasoned that executing someone who can't rationally understand his crime or punishment "simply offends humanity" and would serve no "retributive value." Which is to say: If a man condemned to die can't comprehend the true meaning of society's judgment against him, what is the value of that condemnation?
"Do you have an independent recollection of the Civil War?" asked Justice Kagan in her opinion in Madison v. Alabama. "Obviously not. But you may still be able to reach a rational — indeed, a sophisticated — understanding of that conflict and its consequences."
The justice went on: "Do you recall your first day of school? Probably not. But if your mother told you years later that you were sent home for hitting a classmate, you would have no trouble grasping the story."
The same goes for a person who blacks out before committing a crime: She may still come to appreciate why a prosecutor seeks to punish her.
In Mr. Madison's case, the Supreme Court recognized that the Alabama court that weighed his mental capacities offered a cursory ruling, with "only one sentence of explanation" that didn't take into account the "sole question" that matters: "whether he can reach a 'rational understanding' of why the State wants to execute him."
The high court sent the case back to the lower courts for what Justice Kagan called a "do-over."
The lower courts may again conclude, based on the Supreme Court's guidance and expert medical testimony, that executing Mr. Madison doesn't qualify as cruel and unusual. But until then, the Supreme Court's decision — joined by the rest of the liberal bloc and Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. — provides hope that officials may yet realize that it's inhumane to put to death someone too impaired to remember the crime he committed or comprehend the punishment he is facing.

Texto completo: Carlos Slim perdió $3,000 millones de dólares entre 2018 y 2019, pero eso fue como “quitarle un pelo a un gato”, ya que el empresario no bajó en su posición del ranking de Forbes sobre los más ricos.
La revista señala que Slim tiene una fortuna de $64,000 millones de dólares , cuando en el mismo mes de 2018 ascendía a $67,000 millones.
Parecería que eso lo haría perder posiciones, pero en realidad ganó dos lugares, al ocupar la posición 5 este año.
Slim es el mexicano más rico, de acuerdo con el conteo de Forbes, la cual destaca que él y su familia controlan América Móvil, la mayor empresa de telecomunicaciones telefonía celular de América Latina.
También que con socios de telecomunicaciones extranjeros, Slim compró una participación en Telmex, la única compañía telefónica de México, en 1990.
Además de poseer participaciones en empresas mexicanas de construcción, bienes de consumo, minería e inmobiliarias y el 17% de The New York Times.
En los últimos meses, Slim se enfrentó públicamente al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador por la cancelación del Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de México (NAIM), donde su empresa tiene alta participación.

Texto completo: En una entrevista con ABC News, Ivanka Trump afirmó que su padre, el presidente Donald Trump , no tuvo nada que ver con la autorización de seguridad y la de su esposo, Jared Kushner .
“Hay información anónima de que mi padre presionó, pero el presidente no ha estado involucrado sobre mi autorización de seguridad” , afirmó a la televisora la llamada Primera Hija.
Sin embargo, reportes de CNN señalan que el presidente Trump presionó a su entonces jefe de personal, John Kelly, y al abogado de la Casa Blanca, Don McGahn , para que concediera a su hija la autorización, según tres personas familiarizadas con el asunto.
Aunque el mandatario tiene la autoridad legal para otorgar las autorizaciones, la mayoría de los casos se dejan en manos de la oficina de seguridad del personal de la Casa Blanca.
El proceso tiene que pasar primero por el FBI, que deberá verificar los antecedentes de los funcionarios de distintos niveles.
Segrún el reporte de CNN, el presidente Trump presionó a Kelly y McGahn para que dieran la autorización correspondiente, pero eso no ocurrió y él las autorizó.
La historia de la televisora da seguimiento a lo revelado por New York Times sobre la presión del presidente Trump a Kelly, para conceder a Kushner una autorización de seguridad de alto secreto, a pesar de las preocupaciones planteadas por los funcionarios de inteligencia.

George Will: Might the Democratic push for reparations benefit Trump?

Texto completo: Illustration George Will Washington Post

WASHINGTON — Tiptoeing along the edge of caricature, Sen. Elizabeth Warren says: Native Americans should be "at the table" with African-Americans for a "robust discussion" about making some Americans pay reparations to other Americans to atone for misdeeds by still other Americans. The enumeration of the misdeeds, and the assignment of guilt for them, will presumably come later. What is, however, already clear is that the Massachusetts Democrat is going to need a large table.
If reparations are owed to the descendants of all members of minority groups that experienced protracted discrimination, the Irish can apply, citing the widespread practice of employers posting admonitions that "Irish need not apply." Italians, too: An 1895 advertisement seeking labor to build a New York reservoir said whites would be paid $1.30 to $1.50 per day, "colored" workers $1.25 to $1.40 and Italians $1.15 to $1.25. Asians on the West Coast were subject to severe discrimination and violence. And Jews were restricted from acquiring the momentum that elite universities impart on the path to wealth.
Native Americans and African-Americans experienced uniquely severe injustices. However, there must be some statute of limitations to close the books on attempts to assign guilt across many generations to many categories of offenders (racial, ethnic, class). How does one compute the compensation that can justly be extracted from persons who, although they participate today in the national prosperity to which slaves involuntarily made substantial contributions, had no participation in the injustices inflicted?
It is also true that the nation as a whole was injured by the exclusion of African-Americans' talents from American dynamism, both before and after hundreds of thousands of white Union soldiers were killed or maimed — should their descendants be exempted from paying reparations? — in the Civil War that ended slavery. But, then, semi-slavery survived for almost a century in Jim Crow laws after the end of Reconstruction.
If, however, you doubt that American discord can become much worse, try launching a scramble among racial and ethnic constituencies to assign varying degrees of guilt to others for varying degrees of injuries. Should reparations be means-tested, making affluent African-Americans ineligible? To avoid using moral micrometers to measure guilt and injuries, should lump sums (taken from whom? by what mechanism?) be awarded to groups? Does it matter that 3.1 million African-Americans identify themselves as of mixed race? Or that in the 2010 census, 1.8 million people self-identified as both white and black? Who would administer reparations? And at what cost to social harmony? Racial preferences ("affirmative action") remain broadly unpopular after more than 50 years (the Philadelphia Plan to integrate building-construction unions began in 1967).
And which African-Americans shall count when counting for purposes of reparations? In 2005, The New York Times reported that since 1990, the average annual flow of immigrants from Africa — about 50,000 — had been more than came in chains in any of the peak years of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
There have been instances when reparations could be precisely targeted to defined cohorts that suffered clearly identifiable injuries. Consider an American infamy recounted in William K. Klingaman's "The Darkest Year: The American Home Front, 1941-1942." In 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle and Secretary of War Henry Stimson said "there has been no substantial evidence of sabotage" by people of Japanese extraction living on America's West Coast. But California Attorney General Earl Warren said the "very absence of sabotage" was "the most ominous sign in the whole situation": "I believe we are just being lulled into a false sense of security." So, 120,000 American residents of Japanese descent — a majority of them U.S. citizens — were interned in camps. In 1988, each living survivor was promised a paltry $20,000 in compensation. Two more zeros would have been appropriate.
But today's flippant talk about reparations illustrates a worsening pattern of behavior among congressional Democrats, including presidential candidates. (California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also express vague openness to reparations.) A quarter-baked idea (reparations, a Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all) is floated. There is a stampede to endorse it before thinking about the idea's dependence on enormous revenues of unknown origin and/or unavailable technologies. Then, when details, or the lack thereof, reveal the idea's wild impracticality, the stampeders breezily say: Nevertheless, the idea is virtuous because it is "aspirational." Which means that the Democratic Party is again assisting, as in 2016, Donald Trump's electoral aspirations.

Texto completo: The second patient in history appears to have been cured of HIV, according to scientists in the United Kingdom.

The anonymous patient, being referred to by scientists as the “London patient,” has experienced sustained remission for 18 months after he discontinued use of antiretroviral drugs. After months of testing, his HIV viral load is undetectable.

President Trump praised the accomplishment in a tweet Tuesday morning: “'HIV Is Cured In 2nd Patient, Doctors Report.' @ nytimes Such great news for so many. Tremendous progress being made!," he tweeted.

The first purported cure for the virus came in 2007, when a patient identified as Timothy Ray Brown went into sustained remission. Brown has been free of the virus since then.

Both the London patient and Brown were given bone marrow transplants containing stem cells from donors who carried a genetic mutation that makes them resistant to HIV. Doctors were not intending to cure the London patient of HIV during the bone marrow transplants but were rather intending to treat him for cancer.

The London patient corresponded with the New York Times via email following the apparent cure. He characterized the experience of being healed as both “surreal” and “overwhelming.”

“I feel a sense of responsibility to help the doctors understand how it happened so they can develop the science,” he said. “… I never thought that there would be a cure during my lifetime.”

HIV is the virus that causes AIDS — an autoimmune disease that has killed millions across the globe since its emergence in the early 1980s. More than 30 million people were living with HIV in 2017.

Texto completo: A patient in London is HIV-free, doctors announced this week in what appears to be an astounding case.
A patient who was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 has become the second patient ever known to be cured of the infection that affects close to 37 million people worldwide after receiving a bone marrow transplant intended to treat cancer, doctors say. The patient received the stem cell transplant from a donor with a rare CCR5 mutation that allows HIV resistance in May of 2016 to treat his Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
The London patient, who is remaining anonymous, also underwent chemotherapy. He took antiretroviral therapy drugs for HIV until September of 2017, doctors say. His drug regiment was much less harsh than the only other known patient who was cured of HIV.

The first patient to be cured of HIV, Berlin patient Timothy Ray Brown, underwent two bone-marrow transplants also for cancer treatments, took a cocktail of drugs and experienced serious complications that put his life in danger. At one point, doctors induced a coma. He survived the ordeal, coming out of it without HIV. Over a decade later, he is still considered cured. Treatments that have tried to replicate Brown's result in other HIV patients have failed, until now.
Gupta's team says the London patient's treatment isn't conventional for all HIV patients, but does offer hope for future HIV and AIDS treatments.

Did Bolton blow North Korea talks?

Texto completo: President Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last week was criticized by both parties in Washington long before Air Force One even touched down in Hanoi. Washington’s political class seemed terrified that the nearly 70 year state of “war” with North Korea might actually end. In the end the only positive thing they could say about the meeting was that Trump apparently walked away with nothing to show for it.
The location of the meeting – Hanoi, Vietnam – serves as a great example of what can be won in peace versus what is lost in war. After losing nearly 60,000 US service members in an unnecessary war that took a million Vietnamese lives, the US loss of the Vietnam war resulted not in a communist takeover of southeast Asia but something very different: the domino theory failed because communism was destined to fail. Now we are close trading partners with an increasingly pro-market Vietnam. The result of trade and exchange versus war is a better life for all.
Unfortunately for Washington, the real lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. That is why the Republicans, Democrats, and the entire mainstream media spoke as one against President Trump’s decision to take a bold step and actually meet again, one-on-one, with one of our “enemies” to see if we can avoid nuclear conflict.
One leading Democrat, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), attacked Trump for meeting with Kim because speaking to the North Korean “gives him legitimacy.” Does it make any sense that we should not even speak with our nuclear-armed adversaries because it gives them “legitimacy”? He’d rather have a nuclear war as long as Kim remains “illegitimate”? This is sadly the kind of thinking that prevails in Washington.
The media reported that Trump walked away from the meeting before the scheduled signing ceremony and closing press event. The talks broke down, it was reported, because Kim demanded an end to all sanctions before any reduction in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Washington sighed with relief and said all together, “better no deal than a bad deal.”
Meanwhile the North Koreans held a rare press conference clarifying that they only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling one of their main nuclear facilities. Further, press reports began to surface that National Security Advisor John Bolton threw additional demands on the table which led Kim to draw the meeting to an early close.
Who’s telling the truth? We likely won’t know. But given Bolton’s strong opposition to any kind of peace agreement with North Korea it’s hard to doubt that he had something to do with the blow-up of the summit. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, while Trump’s advisors were shocked when he decided to meet Kim face-to-face the first time for negotiations, John Bolton wasn’t worried at all. As the Times writes, “Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.” And so they did.
Will Trump continue to allow his diplomatic efforts to be undermined by his own staff? Let’s hope the president will ignore Washington, ignore the neocons, and continue to work for peace with North Korea.

Where do lawmakers go; and who pays for it?

Texto completo: Lawmakers' travel has been scrutinized since former Speaker Cliff Rosenberger resigned last April. Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, took trips to destinations such as England, Israel and France — paid for by outside groups or campaign accounts, both his and House Republicans'. The FBI is still looking into that spending, but Rosenberger's attorney says the former lawmaker did nothing wrong.
COLUMBUS – A gaming conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A trip to Israel to talk about cybersecurity and mental health. A New Orleans conference for consumer credit advocates.
Each year, several Southwest Ohio lawmakers spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on out-of-state travel. They meet legislators from other states, learn about how foreign countries tackle problems and make connections that could help them professionally and politically.
But figuring out how much each lawmaker travels and who pays for those trips is far from easy. Legislators must report some travel for official business on annual ethics forms but not all. Some lawmakers use campaign contributions to pay for travel and document trips there. But lawmakers can also receive free trips from national groups or pay for the trips themselves — it's impossible to tell.
Some lawmakers keep diligent records. Since 2013, Butler County Sen. Bill Coley has spent at least $80,000 on out-of-state travel to conferences in places like London, Brazil and Miami using his campaign contributions.
Coley reported spending more on out-of-state travel than other Southwest Ohio lawmakers, according to an Enquirer review of 23 legislators' financial disclosure forms and campaign expenditures. Former Rep. Alicia Reece, D-Roselawn, came in second, spending at least $21,000 in campaign money on out-of-state travel since 2013.
If other Cincinnati-area lawmakers traveled more than Coley, there's no way to tell. A loophole in Ohio's ethics forms allows legislators to travel to certain conferences without disclosing the cost of their trip.
Coley sees the travel as vital to his role as a lawmaker. At one conference, he discovered Ohio was one of nine states that don't tax promotional gaming. At another, he learned about transmitting patient data wirelessly.
"My staff hates it when I travel. The whole time I'm texting them ideas. I'm constantly bothering them," Coley told The Enquirer.
And he pays for the trips with campaign donations.
"My supporters are aware I utilize campaign funds to do that. I don't want to use taxpayer funds," Coley said.
Travel trips up ex-speaker Lawmakers' travel has been scrutinized since former Speaker Cliff Rosenberger resigned last April. Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, took trips to destinations such as England, Israel and France – paid for by outside groups or campaign accounts, both his and House Republicans'. The FBI is still looking into that spending, but Rosenberger's attorney says the former lawmaker did nothing wrong.
The full scope of Rosenberger's travel wasn't detailed on any single form. The Enquirer and other Ohio reporters requested the former speaker's emails, calendars and flight details to detail the scope of it. The FBI subpoenaed hundreds of pages of documents.
Those records revealed Rosenberger took about 50 trips — some personal, but most professional — to locales, such as Normandy, France and Italy; Iceland before his London trip; Los Angeles; Bonita Springs, Florida, for an annual GOP fundraiser and China over three years.
Rosenberger disclosed spending nearly $60,000 on travel (in addition to mileage to the Ohio Statehouse) between 2013 and 2017, according to ethics forms. In comparison, Ryan Smith, who became speaker after Rosenberger resigned, disclosed $5,400 in travel during that time. Ohio Senate President Larry Obhof reported nearly $2,400 and current House Speaker Larry Householder reported $0. In January 2017, Householder and his sons took a FirstEnergy corporate airplane to the presidential inauguration in Washington D.C., according to a Dayton Daily News report.
Rosenberger's travel went far beyond that of most other lawmakers – even those in leadership positions. Still, local legislators have booked expensive trips as well. Sen. Cecil Thomas, D-North Avondale, traveled to Israel to learn about cybersecurity in 2016. Rep. Bill Seitz, R-Green Township, reported a $1,200 trip from the conservative Heartland Institute in 2015. Hyde Park Rep. Brigid Kelly joined a bipartisan group to Israel's University of Haifa in 2017.
Despite outrage over Rosenberger's expensive and extensive travel, no changes have been made to curtail legislators' out-of-state travel or force them to disclose more details about who paid for it.
Ohio's travel disclosure loophole Ohio lawmakers report some of their travel to the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee, a bipartisan group that oversees legislators and lobbyists.
But there's a big loophole: lawmakers are not required to list travel to conferences of national or state organizations that receive dues from the Legislature. That list includes the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which recently held meetings in Grand Rapids, New Orleans and Nashville, and the National Conference of State Legislatures, which held its annual conference in Los Angeles last summer.
Several lawmakers attended these conferences, but none were required to detail who paid for their flights, hotels or food. Some used campaign money for the travel and reported the expenses there, but many did not.
Groups like ALEC draft model bills for lawmakers nationwide and have "tremendous influence," said Catherine Turcer, executive director of the good government group Common Cause Ohio. "We should be able to follow the money of lawmakers who travel to those conferences."
The risk: lawmakers are wined and dined by lobbyists without constituents in Ohio ever knowing, Turcer said.
"Anytime we make a decision not to require really good disclosure, wealthy interests or special interests are going to get in there," Turcer said.
But Coley said he sees no problem with the loophole on certain travel. It encourages lawmakers to attend conferences where they can learn from policymakers across the nation and beyond.
"You want to make sure you have people that are well informed and coming up with the best ideas to improve things in Ohio," Coley said. "It's hard to do that when you're not availing yourself of every opportunity to learn."
No push for change There's little pressure to change a rule that benefits both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. The last time legislators took a hard look at ethics rules, New Richmond Republican Tom Niehaus was leading the Ohio Senate, and he left in 2012, Turcer said.
Last year, Rep. Niraj Antani, R-Miamisburg, proposed banning lawmakers from accepting free international trips and documenting more information about the food and gifts they receive. The bill received no hearings. Antani hasn't yet decided if he will try again.
Ohioans aren't alone in struggling to document lawmakers' travel. While wildfires burned in California, some of its legislators were in Maui being lobbied by utility officials, according to a New York Times report. In response, a progressive advocacy group demanded that lawmakers report travel in real time.
Ohio lawmakers aren't required to file travel expenses in real time either. Ethics forms for the previous year aren't available until the spring, so constituents can't look up their lawmaker's 2018 travel for another several months. If lawmakers use their campaign contributions to pay for travel, those receipts are filed more regularly – but are still months behind.
"It's never too late for somebody to step forward," Turcer said. "This is really the time to think about good rules."
Lawmakers' travel has been scrutinized since former Speaker Cliff Rosenberger resigned last April.

Texto completo: If it feels like this winter is dragging its heels, spare a thought for Rochesterians on this day in 1991, and for the couple of weeks thereafter when much of northern and western New York was paralyzed by an ice storm that began on the afternoon of Sunday, March 3.
Trees bore the brunt of the weather, The New York Times reported:
"In a phenomenon both beautiful and treacherous, ice-laden tree limbs that glittered like diamonds and cracked like gunshots broke and fell, bringing down live power lines, striking cars and homes, blocking roads and streets and disrupting countless lives in countless ways."
Here are key takeaways from the catastrophic weather event that struck 28 years ago.
The ice storm hit late afternoon Sunday, March 3, 1991.
More than 200,000 homes and businesses lost power in western New York. It took 14 days to get the lights back on for most Rochester Gas and Electric Corp. customers.
RG&E customers collectively lost a total of 25.5 million hours of electrical service in March 1991.
Then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency across 19 counties.
On March 11, 1991, a 73-year-old woman was found dead of exposure in her unheated Portland Avenue home, nine days after the storm hit.
Insurance companies paid $75 million in claims related to the 1991 storm.
The Democrat and Chronicle reported on March 13 that the storm's cost had reached $170 million, or more than $300 million at current rates.
On May 16, the Democrat and Chronicle wrote about a 124-page internal report that RG&E did looking at how it could improve its response.
Includes reporting by Len LaCara.

Texto completo: Cuomo, de Blasio hope the effort will make other businesses feel welcome
Dozens of business and civic leaders are making a last-ditch effort to persuade Amazon and its founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, to reconsider its decision to back out of its plans to bring 25,000 jobs to New York City.
More than 70 area leaders, led by the chief executives of Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JetBlue and MasterCard, urged the online retailer to reconsider its decision in a letter published Friday in a full-page advertisement in the New York Times.
"We know that the public debate that followed the announcement of the Long Island City project was rough and not very welcoming," they wrote. "Opinions are strong in New York - sometimes strident. We consider it part of the New York charm! But when we commit to a project as important as this, we figure out how to get it done in a way that works for everyone."
The appeal aligns with efforts by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) to try to talk the company into returning to negotiations, including by placing a call to Bezos, according to the Times. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) As of Friday, though, the company has "given no indication" it would reconsider, the governor said.
The letter was meant to tell other businesses that New York's economic climate is beneficial for them, Cuomo said in a radio interview with WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." "That was petty politics that governed the day," he said of the deal's collapse. "It was a mistake, it was a blunder. We want business, we're open for business."
The head of the Partnership For New York City, the business group that organized the joint letter, said the letter also was meant to assure the technology industry as a whole that the city was eager to attract investment.
"This isn't just about Amazon," said Kathryn Wylde, the partnership's president and CEO. "The treatment [of Amazon] is a black spot on our record in terms of our hope to continue to be a global commercial capital, specifically for the technology industry. We've gotten feedback from firms that have a presence on the West Coast. They've said the treatment that Amazon received, and their decision that it wasn't worth it, was pretty shocking and caused other firms and entrepreneurs to question whether it was worth it to take on New York."
Amazon representatives declined to comment.
Amazon canceled the project and its 25,000 jobs two weeks ago amid an uproar over the company's potential effect on the city and the $3 billion in state and local incentives promised to it by Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio (D). Amazon is moving ahead with plans to bring 25,000 to 37,000 jobs to the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington County, in Northern Virginia, and says it will spread jobs that had been planned for New York around other company hubs.
Besides dozens of tech, banking and real estate executives in New York, elected officials including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D), Carolyn B. Maloney (D) and Max Rose (D) and religious, education and nonprofit leaders signed the letter asking Amazon to reconsider.
But opponents of the deal, who succeeded in turning away Amazon in the first place, remain undeterred, as 77 leaders from labor unions, advocacy groups and nonprofit organizations quickly responded that they were not backing down. They still wanted to see economic growth in New York, the advocates argued, but not without first considering the effect on housing prices and racial and economic equality.
Like other big-city tech hubs, housing costs in New York have risen dramatically in recent years as Apple, Google and other Internet giants have expanded.
"Rather than pursuing economic development policies that lead to displacement, we demand policies that create housing stability and security. We call for Universal Rent Control that gives people, not the real estate industry, the power to determine where they live - no New Yorker should live in fear of a rapid rent increase or an eviction," they wrote.
Of Amazon, the group added: "We defeated them recently, and we will do it again."
The office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), who was sharply critical of the deal New York agreed to with Amazon, issued a statement to The Post saying: "If the elected officials spent half as much time talking to the community as they do Jeff Bezos, we might have come to an agreement."
A key critic of New York's Amazon deal said he saw no weakening of opposition that might encourage the company to come back.
"Nothing has changed in the last two weeks," said state Sen. Michael N. Gianaris (D-Queens). "It's the same people saying they support it who supported it before, and the same people saying they have concerns."

Texto completo: A controversial Acadiana private school is stuck between two unsafe buildings and in jeopardy of having nowhere to hold classes if it does not find a suitable home in the near future.
T.M. Landry College Prep Academy — an unaccredited school accused of academic deceit and child abuse in an exhaustive New York Times investigation — cannot move its 80 students into a makeshift schoolhouse in Lafayette because that building hasn't passed a fire safety inspection, according to state officials.
T.M. Landry also must leave its current location in Breaux Bridge because it can't afford to fix pervasive, longstanding fire safety problems in that building, a school spokesman said.
The school now hopes to begin classes in Lafayette by Thursday, but it appears unlikely the new site will be approved in time. The proposal hinges on fire officials approving half of the building for classes while the rest remains unsafe.
And even in a best-case scenario, fire officials need an average of five working days to review building plans, said Ashley Rodrigue, a spokeswoman for the State Fire Marshall's Office.
T.M. Landry accused of faking success T.M. Landry was the subject of a damaging November investigation by The New York Times in which numerous former students said the school leaders abused them and falsified their academic records. Students told The Times that school officials inflated their grades and fabricated classes and extra-curricular activities in an effort to make the school appear like an elite college preparatory academy. The investigation also said the school made up stories about student's financial and familial hardships, capitalizing on stereotypes of southern blacks to woo admissions officials at Ivy League schools.
After the Times investigation published, school leaders hired attorneys to investigate accusations at the school. Results of that investigation have not been made public.
T.M. Landry has for years occupied a building in Breaux Bridge despite significant safety shortcomings, including a lack of fire sprinklers or a fire alarm system. The fire marshal raised this issue with the school in 2017, but the building still has not been made safe.
T.M. Landry spokesman Greg Davis said the school studied the possibility of renovations but quickly realized they were not affordable, especially since the school's enrollment has plummeted since the Times investigation. The building owner refused to pay for the renovations, Davis said, so the school searched for a new home.
That new home is supposed to be an old skating rink on Moss Street in Lafayette — a rectangular building with a yellow brick facade and long metal walls that stretch about 200 feet back from the roadway — but this building has problems, too. This week the fire marshal ordered the school to delay the move because inspectors hadn't approved or even received any plans for converting the building, zoned for storage, into a school.
Davis said the school would submit plans for renovations — including more emergency exits, an expanded alarm system and a new fire wall — on Friday. These renovations primarily impact the rear of the building, Davis said, so the school is banking on inspectors allowing them to hold classes in the front of the school while renovations are underway in the back.
Rodrigue, the fire marshal spokeswoman, said she did not know if the department would consider this proposal.
Harvard flag on the school walls As of Friday, the old skating rink was nearly empty but showed signs that the school believed it would move in soon. A large room by the front door was filled with several tables and multi-colored chairs. The walls were decorated with flags of Ivy League colleges like Harvard and Yale — some of the same schools T.M. Landry has been accused of misleading with fraudulent admissions applications.
The back half of the build was less polished, however. Stacks of old chairs, furniture and what appeared to be exercise equipment could be seen scattered through the open bay door of a warehouse-like room.
A school official at the building declined comment and said no one there had the authority to speak to a reporter.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Top House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to its security clearances process by Monday, an escalation of the yearslong fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas in the coming days.
The move follows an explosive report that President Donald Trump interceded to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from top intelligence officials. The president directed his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, to approve the application - a move Kelly, who had expressed concerns about the entire process, later detailed in a memo.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with outstanding requests the panel had made related to security clearances for much of the past two years.
"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
While Cummings did not use the word subpoena in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggested he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."
The White House still has not given the panel documents, arguing instead that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters.
Cummings' frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.
"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith - and in private - to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."
Cummings' letter cited reports that Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner a long-delayed clearance and that Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem early last year. Trump's push to get Kushner clearance - and the chief of staff's concerns about it - was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance. The Washington Post later reported on Trump's actions.
Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump have publicly denied the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told The New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance for his son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News earlier this month that her father was not involved in the process.
In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view both top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, which is classified intelligence related to sensitive sources. With that designation, he has been able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and issue requests for information to the intelligence community.
But there was widespread concern in the White House about Kushner's lack of a permanent clearance. Indeed, Democrats on Capitol Hill are also now questioning why Kushner had such trouble attaining that status.
"These new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, and why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee," Cummings wrote Friday.
The White House security clearance process has been a major focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings even garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of beating his ex-wife, had been denied a clearance but still worked in a top position.
At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings' pleas to subpoena the information.

Texto completo: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
By John Schwartz
Hey there, everybody!
Some news drove up just as we were writing to you today. Coral Davenport reports that the White House is planning to establish a commission that will advise President Trump on "how a changing climate could affect the security of the United States." Is that a change of heart from a president who has denied the science of climate change?
Perhaps not. A member of the panel will be William Happer, a Princeton physicist who asserts that carbon dioxide, a primary driver of global warming, is good for the planet. We've written before about how he was entangled in a sting operation by the environmental group Greenpeace.
Coral had another story since our last newsletter: The Environmental Protection Agency announced it would start working on a long-awaited plan to set national drinking-water limits for two harmful chemicals, known as PFASs, that scientists have linked to cancer, low infant birth weight and other health issues.
The agency said it would begin the work by the end of the year. To critics like Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, that sounds like foot-dragging. "While E.P.A. acts with the utmost urgency to repeal regulations," he said, "the agency ambles with complacency when it comes to taking real steps to protect the water we drink and the air we breathe." Of course, we've written quite a bit about the administration's regulatory rollbacks and their effects.
Let's get out of Washington and head to Sweden, where a young woman is skipping school to shame her government into doing more to fight climate change. If you missed it, take a look at Somini Sengupta's profile of Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old activist. It's a fascinating piece that shows her wry, blunt views on climate inaction.
"It's sometimes annoying when people say, 'Oh you children, you young people are the hope. You will save the world,"' Greta told Somini. "I think it would be helpful if you could help us just a little bit."
Finally, one of the first scientists to warn the world about climate change died on Monday. Wallace Broecker popularized the term "global warming," and in 1975 published a paper whose title asked, "Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?" I wrote the obituary for the man who was fond of saying, "The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks."

A president, a comedian and a climate podcast
By Lisa Friedman
It may seem unusual for a former leader of a nation to team up with a comedian to bring a message about climate change to the masses. But that's what Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland, and Maeve Higgins, a stand-up comedian and writer from Ireland now living in New York, have been doing for the past year with their podcast about climate justice called "Mothers of Invention."
The two have reunited for a second season, which began Tuesday. "Mothers of Invention" attracted more than 70,000 subscribers in its first season, which focused on introducing listeners to the driving causes of rising global temperatures. This year the podcast takes a deeper look at people around the world, particularly women, who are influencing the climate debate. "Climate change is a man-made problem that requires a feminist solution" is the show's tagline.
Ms. Robinson, who also leads The Mary Robinson Foundation-Climate Justice, has worked for many years to draw attention to links between rising emissions and inequality. On the show, she tends to play the straight woman and sometimes good-natured scold to the naïve and wisecracking Ms. Higgins, who said she knew little about climate issues before working on the podcast.
"It's very Irish," Ms. Higgins told me at a recent taping in New York. "It's actually the way Irish people show affection, is what I tell myself. When Mary says something like, 'And then we have Maeve over here, a pretty slow learner,' I'm like, 'She likes me!"'
The unlikely pair became a team after Ms. Robinson, who recently published a book on climate justice, expressed a desire to produce a documentary. Her team suggested a podcast instead.
"My immediate question was, what's a podcast? I'm not that generation," Ms. Robinson, 74, recalled.
In many ways the early episodes follow Ms. Higgins's learning curve on climate change, like when she takes listeners on a journey across her multiple conversations with customer service at Chase Bank in an effort to divest her $3,000 in savings from institutions that support fossil-fuel investments. "I hope I bring a curiosity and a much-needed levity," Ms. Higgins told me.
Ms. Robinson thinks she does. "People learn about climate change through Maeve's questions and her sense of humor," she said.
Ms. Robinson said the podcast helped her appreciate the importance of humor in communicating serious issues like the threat of planetary destabilization. (Ms. Robinson is also a longtime, widely respected human rights campaigner, though she recently drew negative attention when she was accused of covering for Dubai's mistreatment of a daughter of the ruling sheikh. She has said her assessment of the situation was "in good faith.")
The podcast features guests like Alexandria Villasenor, a 13-year-old who skips school on Fridays to protest for climate action in front of the United Nations, and Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, an indigenous leader from a pastoralist community in Chad who runs an organization focused on human rights and environmental protection.
So what's a feminist approach to climate change? Ms. Robinson calls it a "progressive, equality-based solution." But, she said, men are in fact allowed on the podcast -- sometimes.

One thing you can do: Think dairy
By Tik Root
We've known for a while that many animal products have an outsize environmental footprint. But which ones have the most impact?
It might not be news to you that the world's beef production creates the most planet-warming emissions over all. But the next item on the list, according to one study, may be more surprising: dairy products.
"So much of the discourse around environmental impact of food is around meat," said Helen Harwatt, a policy fellow at the Animal Law & Policy Program at Harvard Law School, who published a study last year in the journal Climate Policy.
She had expected pork or chicken to be second to beef. But by her calculations, the production of dairy products -- including milk, cheese, ice cream and yogurt -- contributes about 3.6 percent of global planet-warming emissions each year. Her research focused on how policies can encourage shifts to plant proteins from animal proteins.
"It does really have a huge impact," Ms. Harwatt said, though she acknowledged that "a wholesale shift might not be practical for everyone." Rather, she suggested that people look for "low-hanging fruit or baby steps."
Alternative milks are chief among potential substitutes. From soy milk to oat milk; there's no shortage of plant-based options. Cynthia Sass, a nutritionist, pointed people to "pea milk and yogurt, made from yellow split peas."
There are now a plethora of replacements for other common dairy products as well, including cheese and ice cream. And, if you want to get even more creative, Ms. Sass recommended experimenting with pulses, which refers to beans, lentils, peas and chickpeas. Chickpea flour, for example, can be used to make a creamy sauce. And hummus can replace a dairy-based dip at your next party.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In 2004, Amanda Cox was a first-year graduate student studying statistics at the University of Washington, not sure she wanted to be there. So, she sent off applications for all kinds of opportunities, including an internship with the graphics department at The New York Times. She hoped that her disappointment in being rejected for one of them would offer clarity.
"I was trying to figure out, What do I actually really want to do?" she said.
Her only "journalism adjacent" experience at that point was two years filling the back page of her college newspaper with charts, tables and commentary. At the time, the graphics department at The Times asked internship candidates to complete short editing and design tests, as well as to critique charts it had published.
"Amanda redesigned all the test charts," said Steve Duenes, an assistant managing editor and the graphics director of The Times. "We were asking for written feedback, but she decided to crack open the files and rework them herself."
She got that internship, and a year later, Mr. Duenes hired her as a graphics editor. She was also one of the founding staff members of The Upshot, and replaced David Leonhardt as its editor in 2016; in the announcement of her promotion, Mr. Leonhardt said, "Amanda is probably the smartest journalist I've ever worked with."
In January, The Times announced that Ms. Cox was stepping into a new role: data editor. She will help coordinate data work across departments, in interactive news, computer-assisted reporting, graphics and The Upshot, and pave the way for journalism using data to play a bigger role throughout the newsroom. She will also act as an adviser when big questions arise about how to think about and use data thoughtfully, without overstating what it supports.
Journalists are making use of better tools as well as more abundant and accessible data to do things today that they couldn't just a few years ago. For instance: building a model to estimate the number of Tesla Model 3s being produced, as a team at Bloomberg did, or documenting the extent of corporations' efforts to prevent people from filing class-action lawsuits, a project of The Times.
"I think data journalism is successful when you don't need the adjective," Ms. Cox told the podcast "Data Stories" in 2015, "when it's indistinguishable from journalism journalism."
And data visualization -- how best to present it with tools like charts, graphs and interactives -- is not a new challenge, but one that news organizations have taken on more seriously as they make greater use of data.
Using her statistical expertise, programming chops, an artistic flair and classic reporting skills, Ms. Cox has created or had a hand in some of the most innovative, thought-provoking and delightful projects The Times has leveraged data to produce. Among them are interactive charts that let users see a Democratic, Republican or nonpartisan view of jobs report data; election night coverage that includes a forecast of how the race will most likely go as votes come in -- something election-watching mortals have historically had to rely on live experts to interpret for them; and a first-of-its-kind polling project that published polling data in real time, helping demystify where such numbers come from.
For Ms. Cox, working with data hands on, puzzling over the questions that it raises and the best and most creative way to present it, is fun. It's work she can lose time to, she said -- so engrossing that she can "work for eight hours in a row and look up and it's dark outside." (That's not the case for the conceptual stuff, like "theoretical proofs about when properties will hold," she said she realized after her first year of grad school. "I respect the people who can do it, but like, I don't get excited about the epsilons.")
Over the past decade or so, as The Times "got serious about data visualization," Ms. Cox played a central role, Mr. Duenes said, continually imagining new ways to inform and delight readers of The Times with data.
Shan Carter, a former colleague of Ms. Cox's on the graphics desk who now works for Google, drew a comparison between her and the kind of great writer who knows when to follow rules about grammar and when to bend them. When visualizing data, there's making a basic bar graph or line chart, and there's blowing people away with flashy design that may not actually help them learn.
"I feel like the best stuff we did threaded the needle between the two," he said. "It was maybe a new form, it was something you hadn't seen before, but it made perfect sense in context."
Ms. Cox thinks of it as finding the right way to present the specific data she is working with. She digitally sketches different versions of charts over and over before landing on the right one. Her work has drawn attention from the wider data visualization community as well. It has been cited in academic papers and used in classrooms. In 2013, she was asked to give the keynote address at the inaugural meeting of OpenVis, a conference that focuses on open-source data visualization tools and techniques and attracts people from a variety of fields. (She spoke there again in 2017 and 2018.) Lynn Cherny, a data scientist and a chairwoman of the conference, said Ms. Cox was always a hit. "She brings a statistical rigor that some data visualization people don't have, and she's also interested in being creative in the visualization domain," she said.
The Times has had something like a data editor at points in the past (Rich Meislin, for one, had various roles in a similar spirit during his nearly 40-year tenure at The Times, including the title editor of statistical news), but Ms. Cox is not stepping into anyone else's shoes.
"Oh yeah, that makes total sense," Mr. Carter said he thought when he heard about her promotion. "She was the one that we all went to, I feel like, for what you would go to a data editor for."
Ms. Cox dreams that taking on her new role will lead to The Times's publishing more of the kind of information -- in ambitious enterprise stories, investigations as well as everyday news stories -- that would be hidden but for creative investigation of data.
"If it's successful, there will be data applied to news stories," she said, "and data applied to projects in ways that were not obvious. It's not the like first Google search you would do."

Trump inaugural committee hit with subpoena

Texto completo: D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) has subpoenaed documents from President Trump's inaugural committee, the latest of several requests from federal and state authorities probing how money was raised and spent for the January 2017 gala.
The subpoena, issued Tuesday, requests documents related to committee payments to the Trump Organization or Trump International Hotel, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter. It states that Racine is seeking the documents under his civil authority to ensure that nonprofit groups in the District are not "wasteful, mismanaged and/or improperly provided private benefit."
Racine's subpoena was first reported by the New York Times.
The subpoena set a deadline of March 29 for the inaugural committee to respond, according to the law enforcement officials. If the committee does not meet that deadline, Racine's office could file a lawsuit in pursuit of the documents.
A spokesman for the inaugural committee said the committee had received the subpoena and was in touch with Racine's staff.
Robert Marus, a spokesman for Racine, declined to comment.
Racine has been among the most aggressive Democratic attorneys general challenging the Trump administration. In June 2017, he and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh filed a lawsuit alleging that the president's ongoing attachments to his businesses violate anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution.
The president's inaugural committee has been hit with sweeping requests for documents from federal prosecutors in New York and the New Jersey attorney general's office. Racine's is the third demand for documents this month.
The committee, which raised and spent more than $100 million on inaugural events - more than twice the amount raised for President Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural events - was headed by real estate developer Tom Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of the president's. Federal Election Commission filings show that contributions came from an array of corporate interests and wealthy Trump supporters.
The U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York indicated in its subpoena that prosecutors are investigating crimes related to conspiracy to defraud the United States, mail fraud, false statements, wire fraud and money laundering.
New York prosecutors appear interested, among other things, in foreign contributors to the inaugural committee. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal's probe appears to focus on fundraising activities in New Jersey.
Racine's subpoena suggests his investigation is taking a different tack: scrutinizing whether the inaugural committee violated nonprofit regulations by enriching the president's business interests.
That investigation is civil, not criminal. The attorney general has limited power to prosecute crimes in the District, where felony cases are handled by the U.S. attorney's office.
However, D.C. statutes give Racine broad authority to seek penalties against nonprofit organizations that violate D.C. regulations or act contrary to their purpose, up to and including dissolving those groups.

Jared Kushner and Saudi crown prince meet for first time since Khashoggi murder

Texto completo: White House adviser Jared Kushner met on Tuesday with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia for the first known time since the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.

President Trump's son-in-law, who is on a week-long tour of the Middle East, conferred on a number of issues with the crown prince including a peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, according to the White House.

“Building on previous conversations, they discussed increasing cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and the Trump Administration’s efforts to facilitate peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. Additionally, they discussed ways to improve the condition of the entire region through economic investment," a White House readout said.

Not included in the White House readout was any mention of Khashoggi.

The meeting took place as Crown Prince Mohammed still faces scrutiny over alleged involvement in the death of the Washington Post columnist. Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the Saudi government, disappeared in October after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to retrieve paperwork for a planned marriage to his Turkish fiance.

After initially denying involvement in Khashoggi’s disappearance, the Saudi monarchy ultimately admitted his death occurred at the consulate in Istanbul during an interrogation gone wrong, but denied the crown prince had any involvement.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been critical about Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the death and the Trump administration’s response to the killing.

Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt and U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook were also in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting.

Kushner and the crown prince have been in contact since before Trump was inaugurated, ultimately cultivating a working friendship. Communications between the two have continued since the Khashoggi’s death, the New York Times reports.

Star Conductor Accused of Bullying

Texto completo: Daniel Barenboim, one of the world's most celebrated conductors, is known for doing what he wants.
He founded an orchestra (the West-Eastern Divan, a youth ensemble of musicians from around the Middle East), a conservatory (the Barenboim-Said Akademie) and a concert hall (the Pierre Boulez Saal). In 2001, he broke a longstanding informal ban in Israel and conducted a piece by Richard Wagner, an anti-Semite beloved of the Nazis. He makes the kind of political statements most musicians avoid.
Mr. Barenboim, 76, has long been considered untouchable in Berlin, where he is music director of the Staatsoper -- the city's premier opera house -- and principal conductor for life of its orchestra, the Staatskapelle. He is close to city politicians and has used his influence to ensure the opera company receives a healthy annual subsidy of 50.4 million euros ($57.4 million) from Berlin's government.
But cracks have begun to emerge in the conductor's image as Mr. Barenboim has been accused of bullying and humiliating members of the Staatskapelle. The accusations have been reported widely in German media, and there have been calls for politicians to intervene. A spokesman for Klaus Lederer, Berlin's highest-ranking official for culture, whose department provides most of the Staatsoper's funding, said Mr. Lederer has asked the opera company to appoint a third party to look into the matter.
"A piece of art might not always be democratic, but a public institution can't be allowed to transform into a royal court," said a recent article in the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.
The New York Times has communicated with seven former or current members of the Staatskapelle. All highlighted examples of Mr. Barenboim's behavior that they said was bullying and went beyond what was normal for a conductor.
Mr. Barenboim dismissed the accusations. "I was born in Argentina, so there's a bit of Latin blood in my body, and I get upset now and then," he told RBB, a German broadcaster.
In an email exchange with The Times, he denied bullying anyone. "Bullying and humiliating someone," he wrote, "implies the intention of wanting to cause someone hurt, of taking pleasure in it, even. This is not in my character."
Highhanded behavior was common in conductors of the last century, with maestros like Arturo Toscanini and Georg Solti known as harsh taskmasters. (One of Mr. Solti's nicknames was "The Screaming Skull," because of his bald head and temper.) But the debate around Mr. Barenboim raises the issue of whether such behavior is still possible.
"The issue is not personal, but a question of how orchestras are run in the 21st century," Martin Reinhardt, a trombonist in the Copenhagen Philharmonic who played in the Staatskapelle and has openly criticized Mr. Barenboim's behavior, said in a statement.
Willi Hilgers, a former timpanist with the Staatskapelle, said in a series of Facebook messages that Mr. Barenboim repeatedly humiliated him in front of colleagues by singling out his playing. As a result, he said, he had suffered "high blood pressure, depression, the feeling that you can no longer play your instrument, sleepless nights, my family had to suffer as well, no performance without beta blockers and antidepressants."
Mr. Barenboim said that the accusations were part of a campaign to stop him from continuing as music director of the Staatsoper. "The fact these allegations have surfaced now, just as I am in negotiations about renewing my contract beyond 2022," he wrote in the email exchange, "makes me wonder: If people were indeed hurt, as they claim to have been, why speak about it now, at this precise moment?"
"I know that in certain tense moments I have used a harsh tone that I regretted," he added, but that was all. "I am not a shy lamb -- but I am not a bully, either."
In a statement, the Staatskapelle's orchestral board said it had achieved "great artistic successes through mutual trust and close cooperation" with Mr. Barenboim. "This confidence remains untouched," the statement added.
The accusations against Mr. Barenboim first appeared on Feb. 6 in VAN, an online classical music magazine, which interviewed over a dozen current and former employees of the Staatsoper, quoting them anonymously. The article described a leader "who can be inspiring and generous, but also authoritarian, mercurial and frightening."
Mr. Hilgers, 56, said in a Facebook message that his problems with Mr. Barenboim started during the Staatsoper's 2001-02 season, at a performance of Wagner's "Götterdämmerung." During the first intermission, Mr. Hilgers said, he told Mr. Barenboim he had a migraine, warning the conductor in case he lost concentration during the rest of the opera. During the next act, Mr. Barenboim would bang out the rhythm of the timpani's solos with one hand and a foot, as if instructing a child, Mr. Hilgers said, adding that he felt humiliated.
"Afterward, his attacks piled up against me," Mr. Hilgers said.
Mr. Barenboim said in an email, "The timpanist you mention had a beautiful sound and made beautiful colors," but he had "rhythmic weaknesses, which is very problematic." Mr. Barenboim added that the pair had "some disagreements," but that is normal when musicians are trying to get the best results.
Leo Siberski, 49, is now the music director of the Plauen-Zwickau Theater in Germany, and played trumpet in the Staatskapelle under Mr. Barenboim from 1992 to 2003. He said he witnessed outbursts from Mr. Barenboim directed at musicians, and started experiencing them himself after asking for a sabbatical in 1996.
Mr. Barenboim refused the request, Mr. Siberski said. "He soon found a situation where he could humiliate me, also to make an example of me," Mr. Siberski said. This behavior largely involved singling Mr. Siberski out, and making him repeat passages in front of the orchestra.
Mr. Barenboim said he didn't remember any request for a sabbatical. He added it was "fair practice to ask musicians in a world-class orchestra to play their lines alone."
Mr. Siberski said he eventually quit as the orchestra's principal trumpet to "get out of the firing line." Now a conductor himself, he said he has adopted a different approach with the musicians he works with.
"If a responsible artistic director wants to lead his ensemble to new levels of quality, this will always cause some pain," he said. "But there is a huge abyss between pain like sore muscles, and deep mental wounds caused from attacking your very dignity."
Mr. Barenboim acknowledged that the world is changing. "That is generally a good thing," he said. But, he added, "an orchestra cannot function if every tempo, every dynamic is put up for a democratic vote. Somebody has to lead, take decisions and be ultimately responsible."

Texto completo: A loose coalition of Never Trump Republicans is uninspired by Bill Weld and hunting for a more formidable challenger willing to take on President Trump in 2020.

Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, is the only Republican to declare for the GOP presidential primary. But the mercurial 73-year-old endorsed Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and left the GOP in 2016 to run as the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee.

“There are some people that are going to have problems with Bill Weld,” Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who opposes Trump and endorsed Weld this month in a New York Times op-ed, conceded in an interview with the Washington Examiner .

A few dozen Republican insiders dissatisfied with Trump gather about every two weeks, in person and via telephone, operating under the moniker the “Meeting of the Concerned” to discuss a path forward. Niskanen Center and its president, Jerry Taylor, host the meetings. Niskanen is a center-right think tank laboring to develop alternatives to Trump populism.

For many, the preferred strategy would be to run a strong challenger against the president in the Republican primary. Their goal is to steer the party back on a path that they believe is closer to the vision of President Ronald Reagan, not just to derail Trump. Also, Republican National Committee nominating rules that offer ways to challenge Trump on the floor of the national convention in Charlotte make the strategy attractive.

Self-identified Republicans give Trump sky-high job approval ratings. But Never Trump Republicans believe that could change in the months ahead as scandals swirling around the president, and the eventual release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, take their toll.

Mueller could soon conclude his federal probe into possible collusion with Russia in 2016 by Trump and his associates. They’re unconvinced Weld could capitalize on such an opportunity, however.

“As far as what I’m looking for? I’m looking for someone who can draw blood in the primaries. Whether [Weld] can draw blood in the primaries remains to be seen,” Taylor said.

Trump’s Republican antagonists are realistic about their prospects. Some of them are prepared to settle for wounding the president in the primary. No president in the modern era has won re-election after incurring a serious primary challenge.

Yet even this fallback plan requires a challenger with some political juice. Relying on a weak choice who fails to galvanize disaffected Republicans, at least, might discredit their cause altogether — a risk not lost on the Never Trump crowd.

That is among the key reasons why they’re pinning their hopes on Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and others — and why Weld isn’t likely to emerge as the consensus anti-Trump candidate. But Hogan and Kasich have both signaled they have no interest in challenging Trump just as sacrificial lambs.

Opponents that are a strong challenge to Trump would "show Republicans and Republican-leaning independents that there’s a meaningful amount of opposition to him, and that we don’t need him to have good polices,” said an anti-Trump GOP insider active in efforts to dislodge Trump.

Texto completo: Olivia Moultrie is a 13-year-old soccer standout who accepted a scholarship from North Carolina when she was 11 and has been competing with boys for the past several years.
And now she's decided to forgo a career at a college powerhouse — the traditional route for female soccer phenoms of yesteryear — in favor of a trailblazing path that's drawing national attention: Turning pro.
Moultrie signed a multiyear endorsement deal with Nike this week, according to The New York Times, and was featured in a commercial narrated by Serena Williams, "Dream Crazier," that aired during the Academy Awards on Sunday. She also starred in a web-based ad about herself aimed at reaching her younger generation in the sport.
As a result of the Nike deal, Moultrie isn't just passing up on playing for the Tar Heels, where soccer legend Mia Hamm went. She also cannot compete at the official high school or club level.
Moultrie also has signed with sports agency Wasserman Media Group. Her agent, Spencer Wadsworth, told the New York Times that her Nike deal is worth more money than a four-year scholarship she could receive at a top university.
“It’s just a shift in women’s sports,” Wadsworth said. “You see it more and more now where women’s soccer is catching up to the men’s side, and there’s more opportunities for them. ”

Moultrie has competed in the nation's highest level of youth girl's soccer — the U. S. Soccer Development Academy — and started getting homeschooled in the fifth grade, according to the New York Times, so she could train stateside and in Europe; she'll be eligible to play for U. S. national teams at her age level. The Oregonian reported that Moultrie is poised to join the developmental academy of the Portland Thorns of National Women's Soccer League, even though she doesn't currently hit the league's age requirement.
“I tell her all the time, ‘Nobody cares that you’re the best at 12,’" her father, K. C. Moultrie, told the New York Times. “If you’re not the best at 17 or 18, nobody’s going to care. You’re going to be one of those child actors that nobody cares about. You’re going to be Macaulay Culkin. ”

Early $10 Million Haul For Sanders Suggests Network Is Expanding

Texto completo: A clutch of advisers to Senator Bernie Sanders began arriving at the Capitol Hill townhouse that served as his makeshift headquarters before dawn last Tuesday, where they readied themselves to track, among other things, the deluge of donations that would land after Mr. Sanders made his presidential campaign official.
As the team snacked on doughnuts that Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign manager, had brought for launch day, one laptop screen showed a map of the United States. It would light up with an orange dot every time someone gave with the location of each donation.
Within minutes of the 7 a.m. announcement, the whole screen was glowing orange, according to people in the room.
By Monday, after less than a week as a presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders has collected $10 million from 359,914 donors, campaign officials said. But perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders.
For Mr. Sanders, the flood of money from fresh email addresses suggested to his team that he was dramatically expanding a donor network that had already dwarfed his 2020 competition.
"Our second day," said Ari Rabin-Havt, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, "was bigger than anybody else's first day."
[Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]
There is little surprise that Mr. Sanders, whose 2016 Democratic primary run was powered by $230 million in grass-roots giving, would post big fund-raising numbers if he ran again. But the size of his advantage -- he raised $5.9 million in his first day as a candidate, nearly 20 times what Senator Elizabeth Warren did in her first day and nearly four times more than Senator Kamala Harris's $1.5 million -- has established him as a financial front-runner in a crowded Democratic field.
"I think the fact that he has raised so much, so fast, so early should be concerning for anyone else who wants to pick up the liberal flag in this nominating contest," said Craig Varoga, a Democratic strategist who is unaligned in the race.
Of Mr. Sanders's wave of day one donations, only 17 people gave him the maximum allowable amount of $2,800, meaning he can ask more than 99.99 percent of his donors to give again. As of late Monday, only 20 donors have given Mr. Sanders the legal maximum; another 46 gave $2,700, the limit in the last campaign.
More than 48,000 donors have already agreed to give to Mr. Sanders over and over, signing up for recurring donations to be drawn from their credit cards worth a combined more than $1 million each month, according to statistics provided to The New York Times by the campaign. The average overall contribution was just under $26.
But the fact that such a large share of donations came from new email addresses is perhaps the most significant figure beyond the overall totals. While some fraction of those new email addresses are surely old donors with updated contact information -- college students who graduated, for instance, or people who changed jobs -- the idea that a sizable share of Mr. Sanders's donors could be new undercuts the hope among rivals that Mr. Sanders had maxed out a limited, if impassioned, minority of the party when he ran four years ago.
"There's an assumption he's relying on that loyal base of support from 2016," said Jen Psaki, a Democratic strategist and former White House communications director for President Barack Obama. But a rush of new donors "would make people question the assumption that Bernie supporters are solely Bernie loyalists from 2016, end of story," she said.
Mr. Sanders raised $73 million in 2015. This year, he entered the race roughly 70 days earlier in the calendar and raised four times as much on his first day, raising the possibility of a $100 million haul in 2019.
Hillary Clinton, who beat Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary, raised more than him in that race. But that was with the weight of the Democratic Party establishment behind her, a huge list of supporters from her 2008 run and four million more names from a group called Ready for Hillary that had gathered grass-roots supporters ahead of her campaign.
No 2020 rival of Mr. Sanders has anything close to that.
In a move that seemed designed to compete with Mr. Sanders for small donors, Ms. Warren's campaign announced on Monday that she would forgo all traditional private fund-raisers and one-on-one meetings with big donors.
Mr. Rabin-Havt tried to tamp down long-term financial expectations for the Sanders campaign. "It will be remarkable to emulate those 2015 numbers again," he said.
Separately, Mr. Sanders said during a town hall-style forum on CNN Monday night that he would release 10 years of tax returns "soon," suggesting he would provide more transparency into his taxes than he did in 2016 when he only released one year of filings. Mr. Sanders said he did not release more returns then because "I didn't win the nomination."
"Our tax returns will bore you to death," he said. "Nothing special about them."
Money alone is not determinative in presidential politics. In the 2016 Republican primary, a super PAC supporting Jeb Bush burned through $100 million as Mr. Bush finished no better than fourth in any of the first three states. But money does pay for television ads and field staff, and Mr. Sanders's fund-raising advantage will allow him to take risks and make investments others cannot afford.
"He can build a ground game not just in the first four primary states but into the Super Tuesday states," Ms. Psaki said. "He can expand his playing field in places like California."
The Sanders campaign shared new statistics on its donors so far, which skew younger than is typical. An internal analysis showed more than 108,000 of Mr. Sanders's first day contributors were 39 years old or younger, and they gave a combined $2.5 million of the $5.9 million raised. The most common age for a Sanders contributor was 30. Relatedly, more than $3 million of the donations that first day came from mobile devices, a sign of both shifting habits and the relative youth of his donor base. The campaign did not provide a breakdown by gender.
Mr. Sanders has closely tracked his fund-raising haul, campaign officials said, and Mr. Rabin-Havt said that the senator wrote much of the campaign's initial 1,400-word email announcement himself.
The email did not explicitly ask for money, instead directing people to sign a petition supporting Mr. Sanders. Of those who signed, about 40 percent also contributed, his campaign said.
Mr. Sanders's two top digital advisers in 2020, Tim Tagaris and Robin Curran, are both veterans of his 2016 run, but others from that team are on or expected to join other campaigns.
Mr. Rabin-Havt noted the universe of Democratic donors was still growing. "We haven't hit a diminishing rate of return on this yet," he said.
He added that the Sanders campaign believes it has a unique advantage.
"The secret sauce for Bernie Sanders fund-raising," he said, "is Bernie."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Book: Sessions pushed for more death penalty charges

Texto completo: After Brendt Christensen was charged with kidnapping resulting in the death of Yingying Zhang, it was unclear if then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would sign off on federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty, especially since the visiting UI scholar's body hadn't been found.
While the person holding that office ultimately makes the decision, the attorney general doesn't necessarily get too involved in the process or let personal views impact a decision.
But a new book by the FBI's former deputy director, Andrew McCabe's "The Threat," alleges that the death penalty was a frequent concern for Sessions.
"He expressed frustration that many U.S. attorneys, in cases where the death penalty was an option, were not recommending or pursuing the death penalty," McCabe wrote in his book, published last week. "It's nonsense, he would say. 'We have this law, and if we have the law then we've got to start using it.'
"Sessions spent a lot of time yelling at us about the death penalty, despite the fact that the FBI plays no role of any kind in whether to seek the death penalty -- that's a job for (the Department of) Justice."
When a charge is eligible for the death penalty, the local U.S. attorney makes a recommendation to the assistant attorney general, and a capital review committee meets with prosecutors and defense attorneys before making a recommendation to the attorney general.
The confidential process is outlined in the Justice Department's U.S. Attorney's Manual.
In Christensen's case, that process began after his charge was upgraded in October 2017 from kidnapping to kidnapping resulting in Ms. Zhang's death.
Because the trial was still scheduled for February 2018 at that point, Christensen's attorneys have said they only had until Nov. 1, 2017, to file a memo with the Justice Department outlining mitigating factors, calling it an "unreasonably short period" that didn't allow the defense to "conduct even a rudimentary mitigation investigation."
Ms. Zhang's family also submitted its recommendation to prosecutors.
On Jan. 19, 2018, prosecutors announced they'd seek the death penalty, following "the decision and directive by Attorney General Jeff Sessions."
By all accounts, Sessions has always been a strong supporter of the death penalty, dating back to when he was a U.S. senator from Alabama and before that, the state's attorney general.
A New York Times op-ed once referred to Sessions as the "Grim Reaper of Alabama."
While the op-ed's author, Stanford Professor John Donohue, told News-Gazette Media he expected to see the number of capital cases increase under Sessions, other experts said at the time that it was either unlikely or too early to tell.
While just two notices of intent to seek the death penalty in federal cases were filed in 2017, Sessions' first year as attorney general, that increased to at least 15 last year.
That's the highest in a year since 2012, according to a database maintained by the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project.
While almost 30 death penalty cases were sought per year during George W. Bush's presidency, that dropped to fewer than 10 a year during the Obama administration.
Sessions resigned on Nov. 7, 2018, at the request of President Donald Trump.

Texto completo: The fashion designer and former model Jane Mayle has lived on the top floor of an 1860s rowhouse on 12th Street ever since she was a student at Columbia University during the mid '90s. "I still can't shake the sense that I'm going to wake the neighbors," she said on a recent winter evening, wearing a dress of her own design (her Elizabeth Street shop, Mayle, which developed a cult following for her beautiful and eccentric designs, closed its doors in 2008 but she relaunched the label three years ago as Maison Mayle). In 2003, Claudia Gould, the director of the Jewish Museum, moved into the third floor apartment below. A friendship eventually grew out of their proximity and personalities: Gould was struck by Mayle's impeccable eye and charm; Mayle by Gould's spirited generosity. After a leak left the building without gas for nearly a year, Gould proposed an unorthodox idea: Why not have a "progressive" dinner party for the building, a course on every floor, to celebrate the return of a functioning stove?
That first dinner -- a "stairway to heaven" as Mayle called it -- didn't quite go as planned. There was supposed to be champagne in the ground-floor garden, dinner on the third floor, salad and light food on the fourth, dessert on the fifth -- but it was summer, some neighbors were out of town, and what began on the fourth floor then moved to three or maybe it began on four and moved to five and then back down to three -- whatever the order, memories have blurred from the passage of time but also thanks to good cocktails and better conversation. The event was enough of a success that Gould and Mayle planned another dinner to host between their two floors on a recent winter evening, this time inviting friends from outside the building including the artists Eva LeWitt and Ydessa Hendeles, the makeup artist Romy Soleimani and the film and theater producer John Hart.
Guests were greeted in Gould's brightly lit apartment -- surrounded by art -- with small bites of toasted bread topped with escarole, roasted grapes and fennel seeds as well as an artichoke and ricotta spread. Placed next to the wine was a bottle of sotol, a Mexican liquor similar to tequila. Next, everyone moved upstairs to Mayle's apartment, where a seated dinner commenced under a beautiful Ingo Maurer Uchiwa pendant lamp that matched the anemone flowers in small vases dotting the table. The main living-room wall was decorated with contoured plexiglass panels (found in a depot in the south of France by Mayle, and later discovered to be from the original Courrèges store in Paris); a small orange tree sat next to the hearth. The dinner only disbanded with the return of Mayle's son and her stepdaughter -- and with the evening now bathed in the warm glow of revelry, guests drifted downstairs, eventually entering back into the dark Sunday night.
Would the two neighbors do it again? Both said yes without hesitation. "Kadu [Lennox, Mayle's partner] is just getting his beef shank stew perfected," Mayle wrote me a few weeks later, "The orange tree is still alive, and the silverware and glasses are begging to get out again." Here, Mayle and Gould share their tips for entertaining.
Avoid a Strict Theme, But Find Inspiration
While planning, Mayle originally sent Gould a New York Times photograph from last year of a meeting between President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. An unconventional choice, perhaps, but Mayle thought an image could be a way for the two to find a starting point for the evening without imposing a strict theme or sensibility. In it, the two Korean leaders are foregrounded by a massive pink centerpiece decorated with white doves and bright, colorful flowers; a landscape painting hangs behind depicting an autumnal mountain range. "I think we are both quite prone to flightiness but know that needs to be balanced with earthiness," Mayle explained. The evening, which was decorated with colorful flowers from both the local bodega and the Chelsea flower market, embraced a similar kind of whimsical eclecticism without losing a sense of grandness.
Serve a Rare Liquor
Dinner guests were instructed to begin the evening on the third floor, at Gould's apartment, which is hung with pieces by artists Gould has worked with throughout her career such as Kiki Smith and Lisa Yuskavage. Yet all too noticeable was a bottle of Mesh & Bone sotol on the table. Sotol is a distilled liquor and the plant from which it is sourced is a northern cousin to agave (it is called "desert spoon" in English) with long lance-like leaves that spiral from its heart; it offers a slightly smoother taste than tequila or mezcal. Mayle preferred to serve it on ice; Gould liked hers neat. Either way, it offered a festive glint to the evening. At its very end, the two served small glasses of Piemontese Grappa infused with chamomile, whose subtle flavors were a calming digestif.
Mix and Match
"Whenever I have had the chance to go to Claudia's place," Mayle told me, "I feel like hers is the life I would want to live if I wasn't on the fifth floor living the life I have -- it's the way that she makes her place but also the ease with which she moves among her things." The two freely mixed and matched their belongings to seamless effect: In Mayle's apartment, Gould's maternal grandparents' Coalport china and plain white Hella Jongerius plates sat alongside Mayle's Brimfield-sourced antique napkins; Mayle's carved mother-of-pearl-handled silverware and hand-thrown Egyptian pottery were a surprising accompaniment to Gould's 1970s imposing Baccarat crystal wine glasses.
Enlist a Professional Chef
Normally, Mayle's partner, the set designer Kadu Lennox, is the one tasked with preparing the food. "He's a really good cook," said Gould. But because he was out of town for work, Mayle asked the Italian chef Alida Borgna to help, as the two had worked together on a press day for Maison Mayle. Borgna shopped at the nearby Union Square farmers' market (as well as Eataly for rarer ingredients) and took cues from Gould and Mayle, who, wanting to avoid a fussy dinner, simply requested risotto and fish. Borgna prepared a feast of lemon risotto to start, followed by whole roasted turbot with herbs and smashed fingerling potatoes; steamed fennel with champagne vinegar; savoy cabbage with wine-soaked grapes; followed by a light and bitter treviso and Rosa del Veneto radicchio salad.
Serve Fresh Fruit and Chocolate -- Plus a Surprise -- for Dessert
Gould asked her friend Julian Bedel, the Argentine natural perfumer of Fueguia 1833, to bring dozens of his limited-edition samples from the many hundreds of perfumes he typically sells each year. As a silver platter arranged with satsumas and Forelle pears was set on the table for dessert, along with wooden boards of broken hunks of chocolate, Bedel began to pull small bottles from his pockets. Guests were instructed to share a detail of their scent preferences ("roses" or "musk") and Bedel offered a sample to try. Should there be a match, the guest was allowed to pocket it for herself. Bedel is currently developing a scent inspired by Leonard Cohen for the Jewish Museum, in anticipation of an upcoming show later this spring.

Texto completo: Mueller's prosecutors outline lies but make no sentencing suggestion
Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is a "hardened" criminal who "repeatedly and brazenly violated the law," prosecutors told a Washington federal judge.
But in the filing submitted Friday and made partially public Saturday, they recommended no specific punishment for those crimes, saying that is the practice of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose office brought the case.
Prosecutors noted that federal guidelines call for a sentence of 17 to 22 years, although under Manafort's guilty plea in his D.C. case, the maximum he faces behind bars is 10. The special counsel team said it may ask for Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence that runs after any prison time Manafort is given for related crimes in Virginia federal court.
"Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law," prosecutors said, from "garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud" to "more esoteric laws" involving foreign lobbying.
He lied, they noted, "to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counsel's Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government."
He committed crimes while leading a presidential campaign and while out on bail before trial, and then lied to investigators after pleading guilty, prosecutors said, revealing "a hardened adherence to committing crimes and lack of remorse."
The charges in both cases flow from Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The filing helps pave the way for Manafort's sentencings in Washington and Virginia scheduled for next month, as Mueller begins wrapping up his probe.
But the redacted, public document gives no details about Manafort's campaign interactions with Russians. Prosecutors had previously asked the judge for permission to seal material either because it related to "ongoing law enforcement investigations" or "uncharged individuals."
As part of his plea deal in September, Manafort, 69, acknowledged he was guilty of everything he was accused of both in Washington and in Virginia: making millions as an unregistered lobbyist for Ukrainian politicians, hiding that money to avoid paying taxes, defrauding banks to pay his debts when his oligarch patrons fell out of power, and lying to cover up his crimes while trying to persuade witnesses to do the same.
The special counsel's sentencing memo details Manafort's illegal campaign to turn high-ranking American leaders against Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko and toward the pro-Russian strongman who put her in jail, Viktor Yanukovych. Hundreds of pages of exhibits show that Manafort was aware he was breaking the law and that he laundered the profits of his overseas lobbying efforts through offshore accounts.
When he appears in front of Jackson on March 13, he will already have been sentenced March 8 for related crimes in federal court in Alexandria, Va., barring any change in the scheduling as now set for those hearings. Jackson could make the sentence she imposes run during or after his Virginia prison term. In Virginia, where Manafort was found guilty of bank and tax fraud at trial, there is no upper limit to his sentence.
In Alexandria, prosecutors have also asked only for a "serious" sentence. Federal guidelines in that case call for him to spend roughly 19 to 24 years in prison.
Mueller's prosecutors have been handing off other pending legal matters to the U.S. attorney's office for D.C., and the Justice Department is readying for Mueller to formally conclude his work.
In New York, the Manhattan district attorney is preparing to charge Manafort with violating state tax laws and committing other financial crimes, a move designed to ensure Trump's former campaign chairman spends time in prison if the president pardons him for the convictions stemming from Mueller's probe, Bloomberg News and the New York Times reported Friday. Trump has not indicated whether he intends to pardon Manafort, though he repeatedly expressed support for him as his trial played out last year. New York's double jeopardy law, which protects defendants from being prosecuted twice for the same crimes, could pose a challenge for the district attorney's office, however.
Attorneys for Manafort are not due to file their sentencing recommendation in Washington until Monday, having told Jackson that this past week's snowstorm made it harder to meet with their client in the Alexandria jail where he has been held, and asking for a delay.
Under his plea agreement in Washington, federal prosecutors had agreed to ask Jackson to give Manafort credit at sentencing for cooperation. But because she found he lied to investigators and breached that agreement, they are no longer bound by it.
Jackson found Manafort lied about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime aide who the FBI assessed to have ties to Russian intelligence. Those contacts, prosecutors said in court, go "very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating."
Manafort gave inconsistent accounts of an August 2016 meeting in New York City at which he and Kilimnik discussed a peace plan for Ukraine, a top foreign policy priority for Russia. At the time, Manafort was still leading President Trump's campaign. He also lied about sharing polling data with Kilimnik in 2016, prosecutors said in describing how he broke his deal to cooperate truthfully.
The judge also concluded that Manafort lied about a payment that he claimed was a loan and as part of another Justice Department investigation whose focus has not been described publicly.
Defense attorneys have maintained that Manafort did not intentionally give false information and that any inconsistencies were honest mistakes.
In 2017, Kilimnik denied to The Washington Post having connections to Russian intelligence. He was indicted with Manafort on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice through witness tampering.
Kilimnik is believed to be in Moscow and therefore probably safe from arrest because Russia does not extradite its citizens.

'Green Book' pianist played and partied in Wausau

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Pianist Don Shirley, the subject of the Academy Award-nominated movie "Green Book", confronted racist Jim Crow laws when he performed in the South in the 1960s.
But when Shirley came to Wausau to perform in The Grand theater, he had to deal with another problem altogether: A guy dressed as a gorilla stepped on his birthday cake.
That's the way Barbara Lattimer of Wausau, a voice instructor at the Wausau Conservatory of Music, remembers it.
Barbara's husband of 50 years, businessman and music lover Tom Lattimer, arranged to have Shirley perform in central Wisconsin. She doesn't remember the exact year — she thinks it likely was in the early 1970s, after the era the movie portrays. But portions of that evening stuck with her for nearly 50 years, and the memories came flooding back when she went to see "Green Book."
Barbara enjoyed the movie, especially because it revived the time she met Shirley. It also brought back sweeping memories of Tom, who died in 2012 at age 75. It almost felt, Lattimer said, as if Tom were with her in the theater, or that he might show up as a character in the film.
"Seeing the film was so bittersweet for me," she said.
Tom Lattimer had a long career in business, but his passion was music. He especially loved classical and jazz piano.
A 1954 graduate of Wausau High School, Tom Lattimer was a freshman at the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia when he began to follow the career of Don Shirley. Shirley was a stand-out musician, not only because of his world-class skills as pianist, but also because of the color of his skin.
Born in Pensacola, Florida, Shirley was the son of Jamaican immigrants and was a musical prodigy, playing standard concert classical pieces at age 10 and performing with the Boston Pops at age 18, according to his 2013 obituary in The New York Times.
Shirley, who is played by Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in "Green Book," initially yearned for a career as a classical pianist. But when he was in his 20s, he was counseled that American audiences were not ready for a black classical pianist. So instead he made his name performing pop music and jazz.
Shirley started playing gigs at nightclubs and, according to the Times, "invented what amounted to his own musical genre," a blending of pop, jazz, R&B and classical styles. Tom Lattimer likely first saw Shirley perform in Philadelphia, and the pianist's style enthralled him, Barbara said: "He began to follow the career of Don Shirley and heard him play frequently in East Coast clubs."
Following the career of Shirley also meant getting to know him as a person. Tom was the type of person who could easily insert himself into conversation and widely varying situations. He just had the ability to connect with people. So he would talk with Shirley after performances, likely peppering him with questions, and gradually become a casual acquaintance of the pianist, someone Shirley would recognize and chat with.
Tom Lattimer returned home to Wausau to become a successful agent for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. and a community leader who is remembered for his support of the performing arts.
And he continued to follow Shirley's career. He collected all of his albums and whenever possible, went to see live performances. By this time he and Barbara had married, and she would sometimes go with him.
Tom also had an interest in bolstering the art scene in Wausau. He helped develop the Wausau Conservatory of Music, was a chairman for the Festival of Arts and was a leader in the effort to renovate The Grand theater and create downtown Wausau's ArtsBlock.
A costume party at The Wausau Club was truly smashing. It was natural for Tom to help arrange for Shirley to perform in Wausau.
And it was entirely in character for Tom to invite Shirley to a private party held at The Wausau Club later that evening.
Barbara remembers that it was a costume party, and Tom, after Shirley performed, went to change into a gorilla suit. "I remember Tom meeting Don, holding the head of the suit in his hand," Barbara said. "And Don was upset that he wasn't told it was a costume party. I don't know what he would have done for a costume."
Then Tom and Barbara were taken to the club via Shirley's limousine, and when he got in, Tom put his foot in a birthday cake Shirley had in the car.
But all was forgiven when Shirley got to the party. The pianist was the center of attention, with people buying him drinks and talking with him. He asked Barbara, at one point, how he ever got connected with Tom, and all Barbara could do was explain that was just how Tom was. She couldn't bring herself to tell the musician that her husband had been essentially stalking him for years.
The movie portrays Shirley as a serious, regal and sometimes difficult man who insisted on pushing racial boundaries, Barbara said. The Shirley she remembers was jovial, smiling and laid back.
But, she said, at one point in the evening Shirley did share with Tom that he had a higher purpose to his performing tours.
"He told Tom that 'what I do is not about the music. It's about civil rights,'" Barbara said. "And the movie shows that. He puts himself in danger, trying to cross these (racial) barriers."

Texto completo: by Mary Jo Hazard, Contributing writer
For New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth Letts, “there’s no place like home.”
The Palos Verdes resident‘s seventh book, “Finding Dorothy,” is a historical novel told through the perspective of Maud Gage Baum, the widow of L. Frank Baum, who wrote “Wonderful Wizard of Oz.” In the novel, the widow sneaks onto the set of “The Wizard of Oz” in 1938 and meets Judy Garland, who played the iconic character of Dorothy on screen. The 77-year-old Baum offers Garland advice — relating to the actress and vowing to protect her — and makes sure the producers stay true to her husband’s book.
The book’s release coincides with the 80th anniversary of “The Wizard of Oz” hitting theaters.
“As I researched the Baums,” Letts said, “I realized that their own life together had inspired most of the characters and incidents in the (Wizard of Oz).”
Letts, for her part, said she always knew she wanted to be a writer — or at least from the moment she stepped into the Malaga Cove Library, in Palos Verdes Estates, as a little girl.
“My parents moved to Palos Verdes in 1966 when I was in kindergarten,” Letts said. “I started going to the Malaga Cove Library, and the librarian, Mrs. Barkley, was my idol. By the time I was in the second-grade, I couldn’t think of anything I wanted to do but read and write books.”
But she didn’t become a professional write immediately. Instead, after graduating from college, Letts went into the Peace Corps.
“I was a big reader, and I always wrote privately,” she added. “When I got out of the Peace Corps, I needed to be able to earn a living, so I went to nursing school thinking I’ll become a nurse. I’ll have flexible hours, I can live wherever I want, and nursing will be a great career for a writer.”
But her career — not to mention being married with four kids — kept her busy, forcing her to write while her children were in school. Letts didn’t write her first novel until she was 40 years old. She sold her first book in 2003, which came out two years later, and didn’t quit her day job until 2014.
“I got kind of a late start,” she said. “It’s like 20 years until I was an ‘overnight success.’”
And a success Letts certainly is. Besides “Finding Dorothy,” Letts has authored six other books, including “The Eighty-Dollar Champion,” a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, and “The Perfect Horse,” which won the 2017 PEN Center USA Literary Award for research nonfiction.
Now that she’s a successful writer, her routine is similar.
“I spend a lot of time doing things that aren’t writing,” Letts said, “social media, doing interviews, answering emails.”
On a good day, Letts said, she gets four hours of solid writing time. But when she’s in the middle of promotions, as she is now with “Finding Dorothy,” much of her focus is on marketing.
She also spends time sharing experiences with readers and aspiring writers of all ages, including at Dapplegray Elementary School’s annual Arts Alive event.
“I’ve worked hard and I feel very fortunate,” Letts said. “Writing is a tough profession. I consider myself lucky that I get to do what I want to do. It’s a good place to be.”
Letts will sign “Finding Dorothy” at 7 p.m. Feb. 27 at Pages, an independent bookstore, in Manhattan Beach.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- More than a dozen children's advocacy groups on Thursday accused Facebook of knowingly deceiving children into racking up fees from games on its social network, the latest in a string of complaints against the company sent to federal regulators.
The groups called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook violated consumer protection and child privacy laws by duping children into making in-app purchases in games like Angry Birds, PetVille and Ninja Saga, and then making it nearly impossible for children or their parents to seek refunds. The accusation stems from a 2012 lawsuit.
The complaint, filed by 17 groups including Common Sense Media, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, says the purchases were often done without a parent's permission. In some cases, they amounted to hundreds or thousands of dollars.
"Facebook's exploitative practices targeted a population universally recognized as vulnerable -- young people," the groups said in the complaint.
In Washington's greater focus on the power of Big Tech, Facebook has taken center stage. The social network's role in state-sponsored election interference, harmful content and privacy violations has set off a push for new privacy laws and multiple investigations of the company. Next week, Congress will debate proposals for a federal privacy law.
The F.T.C. started investigating Facebook in March after The New York Times reported that the data of tens of millions of Facebook users was unknowingly shared with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The agency is in the final stages of that investigation, with staff members and Facebook negotiating over a potential settlement that could include a multibillion-dollar fine and new restraints on the company's business practices, according to people familiar with the talks.
The consumer groups do not believe the complaint will be included in the F.T.C.'s privacy investigation of Facebook because that case appears to be nearing its completion.
But the children's advocacy groups said they hoped their complaint would continue a drumbeat of pressure for Facebook to take more forceful steps to change its business practices oriented toward children.
"This is a pattern of behavior," said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media. "Facebook has a moral obligation to change its culture towards practices that foster the well-being of kids and families, and the F.T.C. should ensure Facebook is acting responsibly."
In a statement, Facebook said that in 2016 it had updated some of its policies governing purchases by minors.
"We have in place mechanisms to prevent fraud at the time of purchase, and we offer people the option to dispute purchases and seek refunds," the statement said. "As part of our long history of working with parents and experts to offer tools for families navigating Facebook and the web, Facebook also has safeguards in place regarding minors' purchases."
The F.T.C. declined to comment.
Details about the in-app purchases came from court documents that were unsealed at the request of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit journalism organization. The documents were part of a class-action lawsuit brought in 2012 and settled in 2016 for an undisclosed sum.
The 135 pages of unsealed documents included internal corporate memos and emails in which Facebook employees encouraged game developers to create features that would get children to make credit card charges while playing games. In many cases, the children did not realize that their parents' credit cards were attached to the games or that they were spending real money, the consumer groups argued in their complaint.
The F.T.C. polices consumer fraud, deception and unfair practices and is well versed in the issue of in-app purchases -- the charges made within an app and directly charged through iTunes or Google Play stores, for example.
In 2013, the agency started an investigation into major charges by children using in-app purchases for things like "gold coins" in smartphone games. The F.T.C. reached a $32.5 million settlement with Apple and a $19 million settlement with Google over accusations that children were deceived into making such purchases and that the companies did not properly disclose to parents that they were being charged for their children's purchases.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Photograph The F.T.C. is being urged to investigate whether Facebook violated laws by asking children to make in-app purchases in Angry Birds and other games.

Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Glory Denied’ tells POW’s story

Texto completo: Pittsburgh Opera's "Second Stage" productions of new operas, which account for one of the six operas it stages each season, fulfill one of the company's most vital missions.
We love the old operas that dominate programming everywhere because of their great music serving universal themes. Contemporary opera has the advantage of addressing issues of our own lifetime.
To that end, Pittsburgh Opera will present "Glory Denied" by Tom Cipullo in a Second Stage production Feb. 23 to March 3 at its Pittsburgh headquarters.
The opera is based on the book "Glory Denied" by Thomas Philpott, which tells the story of Jim Thompson, an American hero who was the longest held American prisoner during the Vietnam War. The late Sen. John
McCain, also a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down, wrote the introduction to the book.
Cipullo discovered "Glory Denied" while working at the famous McDowell Colony for artists when he read a New York Times book review. He wanted to write an opera and sensed the potential of Thompson's story. After ordering and reading the book he became convinced it would be his first opera.
The composer is 62 and says the Vietnam era is part of his formative years.
"I wanted to tell that story. I wanted to reenact the most important parts of the story. Those were less about Col. Thompson's family and more about the time in which he lived and how the nation changed from 1964 to 1973," he says.
Nearly all the words of the libretto are the actual words of the real people. But to convey how the life in the U.S. changed during the Vietnam War, Cipullo wrote the words to one number. He called it a "Catalog Aria," a nice allusion to one of the many famous excerpts from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Don Giovanni," which will open Pittsburgh Opera's 2019-20 season.
Cipullo says it was great fun to think about and write an aria which includes Teflon cookware, men with long hair, stay-pressed shirts and miniskirts.
"Young people don't realize how much our country changed in those years," he says. "If you look at high school year books in 1964, all the boys are in jackets and ties and have short hair. Yearbooks from 1973 look like it's a different planet with the counter-culture and doing your own thing. I think Col. Thompson must have felt he came back to Mars when he returned in 1973."
The opera is in two acts: In Captivity and Welcome Home, and lasts about 70 minutes. "Welcome Home" is an ironic title, because Thompson was only known to be missing in action and his wife Alyce had moved on to another man. Thompson and his wife are the opera's only characters, with different singers for the two acts.
Baritone Ben Taylor will play Thompson in Act II, which he says is a "blast to perform." He learned his part in the opera first, then read the book for nuances of characterization.
"To act this role in a way that's truthful to the person and story and be dramatically engaging is tough," Taylor says. "The singing part is very difficult as far as memorizing and getting it into your body. But I will give Cipullo credit that, as a great composer would, he gives the singer the tools (in the music itself) to learn it."
"Glory Denied" has been a big success for Cipullo, with more than 20 productions since 2007 and four more set for next season. He praises Pittsburgh Opera for its presentation of contemporary operas.
"Who's to say," asks Cipullo, "opera can't have a new golden age in America in the 21st century?"

"I feel like a lot of people might know the Bellamy Brothers' and John Anderson's music, but maybe they're not familiar with who they are as artists. I think that this is going to be a great opportunity for the country music fan base to be re-introduced to these guys and, selfishly, I'm just excited to share the stage with them! It'll be great to have Trace back out on the road with us, and I can't wait for one of my newer friends and heroes, Lauren Alaina, to blow these crowds away."

The second album by Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness, "Zombies on Broadway," was inspired by New York City.

"I have so much emotion wrapped up in this album," he said upon its release. "'Upside Down Flowers' is a version of real and surreal Southern California that surrounds me physically and emotionally."
He'll mix some of those songs with past faves like "Cecilia and the Satellite," "Fire Escape" and "So Close" when he plays Stage AE, North Shore, with Flor and Grizfolk.
Doors open at 6 p.m. Tickets are $32; ticketmaster.com.

Texto completo: What is the meeting about? Catholic church leaders from around the world are holding an unprecedented summit on clergy sex abuse of children, beginning Thursday. The four-day meeting convened by Pope Francis will include 190 presidents of bishops' conferences and other officials. It will feature lectures and workshops on preventing abuse, tending to victims, and investigating abuse cases.
Officials say there will be three themes: responsibility, accountability, and transparency. Some observers have high expectations for change from the meeting, but others think the church is nowhere near enacting needed reforms.
Boston College theology professor Stephen Pope said, “I think the Vatican and leaders in the church are now realizing the problem is global, not just a problem of the developed world. . . . People are beginning to connect the dots that when you have unaccountable power, people abuse it, whether they have Roman collars on or not."
Why have I been hearing so much about this problem? In the early 2000s, after The Boston Globe Spotlight series on clergy sex abuse broke, the church in the United States moved to protect children from sex abuse. Pope, the professor, said in a telephone interview that “significant progress" was made in combating the problem.
But the headlines have kept coming, in the United States and around the world, and there seemed to be an uptick in the past year.
What happened in the past year? There were a number of scandalous stories in the past year or so. Here are three of the biggest:
■ Pope Francis sparked outrage in January 2018 when he defended a bishop in Chile who was accused of protecting a pedophile priest. He later said he had made a mistake. "I was part of the problem," he told a Chilean abuse survivor in a private meeting at the Vatican in June.
■ A Pennsylvania grand jury report released in August found that church leaders in Pennsylvania covered up sexual abuse by 300 priests. The report found the priests had more than 1,000 victims over a period of 70 years and said there were probably thousands more victims. Following the report, more than a dozen other state attorneys general and the federal government launched investigations.
■ Allegations of sex abuse surfaced last summer against Theodore E. McCarrick, a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington. Critics said Francis had turned a blind eye to the abuse, but the Vatican disputed that. Pope Francis has expelled McCarrick from the priesthood, the Vatican said Saturday as the clergy sex abuse summit approached.
How do Catholics feel about the clergy sex abuse scandals? Some Catholics are getting impatient, former Spotlight Team member Michael Rezendes reported in a Boston Globe Ideas article. “It's way past time for words and promises," Marie Collins, a clergy abuse survivor in Ireland, told Rezendes. “I think the church is at a crossroads. It's either do something now or get off the playing field. A lot of people have come to the end of their tether," said Collins, a former member of a blue-ribbon panel named by Pope Francis to make policy recommendations for preventing abuse.
BC's Pope agreed that that some Catholics are fed up. “Many Catholics have left. Others are disgusted," he said. “I think 'impatience' is not strong enough."
What is the issue with accountability for American bishops? BC's Pope said that in the United States, after the crackdown on clergy sex abuse in the early 2000s, one gap in the policy remained: accountability for bishops.
“The missing piece here is the inability to hold bishops accountable, either for bishops covering up abusive priests or who themselves were sexual abusers, and this has continued to be a problem," he said.
US bishops met in November and were going to put accountability measures in place, but the Vatican intervened, putting it on hold. Pope said that created the expectation that the measures would be approved at this meeting.
“But it's not on the agenda, really," he said. “It might come up, but it's not the purpose of the conference."
“The pope says the purpose is to educate the bishops. Educating is different than legislating," he said.
What are the other secrets and scandals I've been hearing about? In recent weeks, a variety of other stories have broken that have exposed church secrets, though they are not about clergy sex abuse of children. Here are some of them:
■ The Vatican confirmed that it has general guidelines for what to do when priests break their celibacy vows and father children, The New York Times reported.
■ Pope Francis has acknowledged that priests and bishops have sexually abused nuns, The Associated Press reported.
■ While the church has rejected gay congregants, thousands of the church's priests are gay, The New York Times reported.
What has Boston Cardinal O'Malley said and done about the clergy sex abuse scandals? O'Malley, who arrived in Boston in 2003 to deal with the Boston Archdiocese's sex abuse scandal, will attend the summit. He is the president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Children, the blue ribbon panel developing policy recommendations to combat abuse. He himself apologized in August for the way his office handled a 2015 letter from a New York priest alleging sexual abuse by Cardinal McCarrick. O'Malley's secretary did not deliver the letter to O'Malley on the grounds that the commission was about policies and not individual cases. Church officials say that office procedure has been changed and O'Malley will review all abuse-related letters.
As the scandals have broken, O'Malley has warned that if the church doesn't address clergy sex abuse it “could threaten and endanger the already weakened moral authority of the Church."
In a letter to Catholic churches this weekend, O'Malley and four other Massachusetts bishops said, “The past year has been especially traumatic, and we again apologize to survivors and their families for all they have endured. We also apologize to the Catholic community for the seemingly unending nature of this scandal and the many questions it raises regarding Church leadership."

Texto completo: President Trump's decision to declare a national emergency so he can build a wall along the border with Mexico won't solve the problem of illegal immigration.

The gambit only invites litigation that will squander taxpayer money and other resources sorely needed to address a host of border-related issues. Those issues include illegal immigrants but also the status of the Dreamers, the need to promote legal immigration, the fate of a program that essentially allows wealthy foreigners to buy green cards and, as the New York Times reported last weekend, the problem of rampant pollution in border cities.

America needs a global solution - one in which the President, both chambers of Congress, and both political parties compromise to move the needle on all of these topics. However, Congress repeatedly has failed to work across party or chamber lines on immigration and other issues, so recent presidents have felt empowered to act on their own. In Mr. Trump's case, the issue is immigration. In Barack Obama's case, it was health care, among other issues.

Mr. Trump's critics, including some fellow Republicans, have accused him of overreach - of trying to usurp Congress' authority in financial matters. That will be one of the key points on which Mr. Trump's emergency declaration is challenged in court. It's a valid point, yet there is some irony in members of Congress criticizing the President for usurping authority they've failed to exercise themselves.

The President decided to declare a national emergency, potentially allowing him to divert Defense Department money for wall construction because he didn't like the deal Congress reached last week to address some immigration issues and avert another government shutdown. That deal allowed for 55 miles of wall construction - far less than the 200 or so miles Mr. Trump has called for - while also increasing the ranks of Border Patrol officers, expanding the number of immigration judges and setting new guidelines for the operation of detention centers.

However, neither that deal nor the emergency declaration does anything about the Dreamers, young people who were brought to America illegally by their parents and consider the U.S. their home. The fate of the Dreamers has been under discussion for years. They may be senior citizens before Congress finally decides what to do about them.

And what about other issues drowned out in the wall debate? One is water and air pollution that originates at poorly regulated factories in Mexico and affects towns on the U.S. side of the border. Talk about illegal border crossing.

Then there's the EB-5 visa program, which provides fast-track residency for wealthy foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in U.S. business projects. The concept is a disgrace, and the program should be abolished.

The President and congressional leaders should roll up their sleeves and tackle these issues. That's why they were elected. The American people want real progress - not more litigating, sniping, and posturing - on issues vitally important to the nation.

Chanel: Iconic couturier Karl Lagerfeld has died

Texto completo: PARIS (AP) -- Chanel's iconic couturier, Karl Lagerfeld, whose accomplished designs as well as trademark white ponytail, high starched collars and dark enigmatic glasses dominated high fashion for the past 50 years, has died. He was around 85 years old.
Such was the enigma surrounding the German-born designer that even his age was a point of mystery for decades, with reports he had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938. In 2013, Lagerfeld told French magazine "Paris Match" he was born in 1935, but in 2019 his assistant still didn't know the truth -- telling AP he liked "to scramble the tracks on his year of birth -- that's part of the character."
Chanel confirmed that Lagerfeld died early Tuesday.

Lagerfeld was of the most hardworking figures in the fashion world holding down the top design jobs at LVMH-owned luxury label Fendi from 1977, and Paris' family-owned power-house Chanel in 1983. Indeed, his indefatigable energy was notable: he lost around 90 pounds in his late 60s to fit into the latest slimline fashions.
Though he spent virtually his entire career at luxury labels catering to the very wealthy -- including all of 20 years at Chloe -- Lagerfeld's designs quickly trickled down to low-end retailers, giving him an almost unprecedented impact on the entire fashion industry.

At Chanel, he served up youthful designs that were always of the moment and sent out almost infinite variations on the house's classic skirt suit, ratcheting up the hemlines or smothering it in golden chains, stings of pearls or pricey accessories. They were always delivered with wit.
"Each season, they tell me (the Chanel designs) look younger. One day we'll all turn up like babies," he once told The Associated Press.
His outspoken and often stinging remarks on things as diverse as French politics and celebrity waistlines won him the nickname "Kaiser Karl" in the fashion media. Among the most acid comments included calling President Francois Hollande an "imbecile" who would be "disastrous" for France in Marie-Claire, and telling UK's The Sun that he didn't like the face of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister.
"She should only show her back," he advised.
Lagerfeld was also heavily criticized for sending out a negative message to women when he told France's Metro newspaper that signer Adele was "a little too fat."
Despite this, he did have an under-reported soft side. He was known to be very kind to his staff at Chanel and was famous for according journalists generously long interviews after each fashion show. He also shared his unmarried life in his Parisian mansion with a Siamese cat called Choupette.
"She is spoilt, much more than a child could be," he told AP in 2013, revealing also that he would take her to the vet every 10 days overcautiously.
Lagerfeld had little use for nostalgia and kept his gaze riveted toward the future. Well into his 70s, he was quick to embrace new technology: He famously had a collection of hundreds of iPods.
A photographer who shot ad campaigns for Chanel and his own eponymous label, Lagerfeld also collected art books and had a massive library and a bookstore as well as his own publishing house. He was also an impressive linguist switching between perfect French, English, Italian and his native German during interviews at post-catwalk celebrity media scrums.
Although he spent much of his life in the public eye, Lagerfeld remained a largely elusive figure. Even as he courted the spotlight, he made an apparently deliberate effort to hide what was going on behind his trademark dark shades.
"I am like a caricature of myself, and I like that," British Vogue quoted Lagerfeld as saying. "It is like a mask. And for me the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long."
After cutting his teeth at Paris-based label Chloe, Lagerfeld consolidated his reputation in the 1980s when he revived the flagging fortunes of the storied Paris haute couture label Chanel. There, he helped launch the careers of supermodels including Claudia Schiffer, Ines de la Fressange and Stella Tennant.
In a move that helped make his a household name, Lagerfeld designed a capsule collection for Swedish fast-fashion company H&M in 2004 and released a CD of his favorite music shortly after.
A weight-loss book he published in 2005 -- "The Karl Lagerfeld Diet" -- consolidated his status as a pop culture icon. In the book, Lagerfeld, said that it was his desire to fit into the slim-cut suits by then-Dior Homme designer Hedi Slimane that had motivated his dramatic transformation.
The son of an industrialist who made a fortune in condensed milk and his violinist wife, Lagerfeld was born into an affluent family in Hamburg, Germany.
Lagerfeld had artistic ambitions early on. In interviews, he variously said he wanted to become a cartoonist, a portraitist, an illustrator or a musician.
"My mother tried to instruct me on the piano. One day, she slammed the piano cover closed on my fingers and said, 'draw, it makes less noise," he was quoted as saying in the book "The World According to Karl."
At age 14, Lagerfeld came to Paris with his parents and went to school in the City of Light. His fashion career got off to a precocious start when, in 1954, a coat he designed won a contest by the International Wool Secretariat. His rival, Yves Saint Laurent, won that year's contest in the dress category.
Lagerfeld apprenticed at Balmain and in 1959 was hired at another Paris-based house, Patou, where he spent four years as artistic director. After a series of freelance jobs with labels including Rome-based Fendi, Lagerfeld took over the reins at Chloe, known for its romantic Parisian style.
Lagerfeld also started his own label, Karl Lagerfeld, which though less commercially successful than his other ventures, was widely seen as a sort of sketchpad where the designer worked through his audacious ideas.
In 1982, he took over at over Chanel, which had been dormant since the death of its founder, Coco Chanel, more than a decade earlier.
"When I took on Chanel, it was a sleeping beauty -- not even a beautiful one," he said in the 2007 documentary "Lagerfeld Confidential." "She snored."
For his debut collection for the house, Lagerfeld injected a dose of raciness, sending out a translucent navy chiffon number that prompted scandalized headlines.
He never ceased to shake up the storied house, sending out a logo-emblazoned bikini so small the top looked like pasties on a string and another collection that dispensed entirely with bottoms, with the models wearing little jackets over opaque tights instead.
Lagerfeld was open about his homosexuality -- he once said he announced it to his parents at age 13 -- but kept his private life under wraps. Following his widely known relationship with a French aristocrat who died of AIDS in 1989, Lagerfeld insisted he prized his solitude above all.
"I hate when people say I'm 'solitaire' (or solitary.) Yes, I'm solitaire in the sense of a stone from Cartier, a big solitaire," Lagerfeld told The New York Times in an interview. "I have to be alone to do what I do. I like to be alone. I'm happy to be with people, but I'm sorry to say I like to be alone, because there's so much to do, to read, to think."
As much as he loved the spotlight, Lagerfeld was careful to obscure his real self.
"It's not that I lie, it's that I don't owe the truth to anyone," he told French Vogue in an interview.

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King has turned to a higher power in hopes that his committee assignments will be restored.

The Iowa Republican on Monday asked constituents to pray for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to reinstate his committee assignments, the Sioux City Journal reported.

King has been pressuring McCarthy, R-Calif., to reinstate the assignments after he made comments in a a New York Times interview appearing to support white supremacy.

Republicans revoked King’s committee assignments last month amid an uproar over his comments to the New York Times, in which he asked why phrases such as "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" have become "offensive." King previously served on the Judiciary and Agriculture committees.

“The language police are out there day after day after day after day,” King said Monday. "They are searching the internet for something to be offended by."

After King’s comments sparked backlash, the Republican said he rejects white nationalism and white supremacy.

“It's not part of any of my ideology. I reject anyone who carries that ideology.”

Resumen: Some candidates – like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who announced his presidential bid today – employ more populist rhetoric than others. But all are trying to show they are on the side of working class voters.

Texto completo: “Stop calling Donald Trump a populist,” liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman ordered the media last August.
It’s true, Mr. Krugman wrote, President Trump does occasionally “pose” as a champion of ordinary Americans against the elite. But, he asserted, the president’s record reveals otherwise. Mr. Trump, for his part, boasts that his policies have been great for American workers and commands big crowds doing so.
Definitions of populism can vary, and candidates themselves often shy away from embracing the term, perhaps to avoid limiting their appeal. Populism can exist on both the left and the right, and depending on the audience, the term can have either negative or positive connotations. 
Still, as the 2020 Democratic hopefuls begin staking out positions aimed at attracting voters, some see taking back ownership of the term “populist” as key to framing the contest against Trump. 
A populist lane has formed in the Democratic primary contest – and is starting to get crowded.
On Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont made his bid official, hoping to revive the grass-roots movement that almost overtook Hillary Clinton in 2016. “Real change never takes place from the top on down but always from the bottom on up,” the self-described democratic socialist declared in a campaign video.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts jumped in earlier this month, railing against a system “rigged by the wealthy” and touting her proposal for an “ultra-millionaire tax.” Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is currently on a “listening tour” of early primary states under the banner “Dignity of Work” and will decide whether to run in March.
Populist themes, to some extent, are infusing nearly every Democratic campaign. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is running on the slogan “For the People.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who appears to be positioning herself as more of a centrist, speaks of “tax loopholes designed by and for the wealthy.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, if he runs, is expected to lean heavily on his blue-collar roots in Scranton, Pa.
“If you’re a Democrat running for president, you’re going to have a really hard time if you’re not talking in populist ways about the economy,” says Michael Kazin, author of the book “The Populist Persuasion.” 
Mr. Kazin, a historian at Georgetown University, says he prefers to say that candidates are employing populist rhetoric or ideas, as opposed to labeling someone a populist or not.
“At base, the term refers to people who believe there’s a virtuous majority of hard-working folks who are exploited, oppressed, betrayed – choose your verb – by an elite, and the elite can be political, economic, cultural, or all three,” he says.
A ‘tea party of the left’ The latest sign of the rise of a populist “tea party of the left” came last week with Amazon’s sudden cancellation of a headquarters in the Queens borough of New York. Opponents of the project, including freshman firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) of New York, had raised alarm bells over the tax breaks offered to one of the world’s largest corporations and the prospect of gentrification displacing residents.
This current flaring of populist sentiment fits into a long American tradition that first reached the White House in 1829 with the inauguration of President Andrew Jackson, who championed the “common man.” By the end of the century, populist orator William Jennings Bryan dominated the Democratic Party and won its presidential nomination three times.
In the 20th century, radio broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin, Louisiana Gov. Huey Long, Alabama Gov. George Wallace, and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan all laid claim to mass appeal through populist rhetoric that veered into demagoguery.
Today, Trump displays a portrait of President Jackson in the Oval Office – a sign of his admiration for a predecessor who he says “defied an arrogant elite.”
In his successful 2016 campaign, Trump appealed to the economic and cultural grievances of white working-class voters, targeting international trade and illegal immigration as culprits.
“Right-wing populism often includes a scapegoating of a third party – blacks, immigrants, people who are seen as the illegitimate beneficiaries of the ruling elites,” says David Greenberg, a historian at Rutgers University who has written on populism. “Populism can be very nationalistic.”
But true populism, says Kazin, is not just about white working people.
“It’s about the majority of the population, who are workers of one kind or another, who have not graduated from college,” Kazin says. “That includes most black and Latino people even more than white people.”
To Senator Brown, who has made a career of fighting for workers, Trump’s brand of politics should not be called populism.
“Populists are never racist,” says Brown, speaking last week at a Monitor Breakfast. “Populists don’t engage in hate speech. Populists don’t give tax cuts to rich people. Populists don’t play off American workers against Mexican workers.”
The electability factor For populist Democrats running this cycle, the challenge will be gaining enough support to win the nomination, particularly since they may wind up splitting the far-left vote. Senator Warren’s ideologically charged rhetoric thrills her base, but can she expand her appeal to more moderate voters?
Senator Sanders faces the challenge of being a second-time candidate at a time when many are looking for new faces and when polls show party members valuing electability above all else.
Still, “electability and beating Donald Trump is also about what message will resonate,” says Kathleen Sullivan, Democratic National Committeewoman for New Hampshire, which holds the first primary. “The message ‘dignity of work’ – of working people, middle-class people, economic disparity – plays well with a lot of Democrats.”  
Both Warren and Brown make a point of asserting that they believe in capitalism but that markets need rules. Brown stands out among likely Democratic candidates for his unwillingness to sign on to the Green New Deal, a resolution that addresses climate change and economic inequality, or "Medicare for all."
“I don’t need to co-sponsor every bill that others think they need to co-sponsor to show my progressive politics,” Brown said at the Monitor Breakfast. “I want to get something done for people now.”
The Ohio Democrat could be called a “pragmatic populist” who doesn’t shy away from making common cause with Republicans when their goals converge. Brown opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement from the start and worked with the Trump administration to fix it, though they have parted company over the NAFTA replacement agreement.
Whether “pragmatic populism” can sell in an era of rising Democratic liberalism and socialist thought, especially among young progressives, is an open question. 
It’s also unclear if the less-populist Democrats in the race can take on enough of a populist tinge to match the political moment. 
Senator Harris’s profile is as a former state attorney general who was tough on crime, not as a champion of workers. Senator Klobuchar, also a former prosecutor, is seen as a business-friendly moderate who works well with Republicans. Sen. Cory Booker (D) of New Jersey is a business-friendly liberal with a history of close ties to Wall Street.
Back when she was a House member, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) of New York held some conservative views, including on guns, though her positions have since evolved. Many of the candidates, including Senators Booker and Gillibrand, have said no to corporate PAC donations.
As for Biden, a pitch as “Uncle Joe,” fighting for the little guy, might not survive first contact.
“He likes to claim these affinities with the folks of Scranton and working-class Catholics. That’s kind of ‘populism as biography.’ But he was also the senator from Delaware and credit-card land,” says Mr. Greenberg, noting that then-Senator Biden had championed bankruptcy reform, which passed in 2005 and made it harder for consumers to get debt relief.
“But it’s not always either-or,” he adds. “Certainly Warren has populist bona fides. And others can talk a good game and mobilize anti-Trump outrage. But they also need to combine it with an appeal toward responsible governance, toward moderation, toward pragmatism and statesmanship.”

Texto completo: Red wine in moderation could be good for you, according to research and the Blue Zones Project.
One of the "Power 9" concepts of the Blue Zones for improving health and longevity is "wine @ 5."
A glass of wine or two each day with friends and food contributes to longevity, according to Dan Buettner, founder of the Blue Zones Project.
The owner of Natural Wines in Naples advises wine lovers to pursue healthy wines produced with a combination of green farming and natural yeasts.
"Seek out wines that are unfiltered because that is where the good stuff resides for heart," Peter Rizzo, owner of the Natural Wines,said. The store is located at 4949 Tamiami Trail N., Unit 102.
There is a worldwide movement of clean farming with wine-making, similar to how wine was made before World War II without additives or chemicals, Rizzo said. He carries 250 wines, ships to customers, and his website, www.naturalwinesnaples.com contains articles on the health benefits of natural wines.
The Blue Zones project was introduced to Southwest Florida in 2015 based on the travels of Buettner, a National Geographic explorer.
He identified communities worldwide where people share lifestyle traits and live to 100 or older. He wrote a New York Times best-seller about the nine principles of longevity.
The "Power Nine" include moving naturally by being physically active, eating a plant-slant diet, eating until you are 80 percent full and knowing your purpose in life. The other concepts are taking time to relax, having a healthy social network, belonging to a faith-based community, and putting loved ones first.
The philosophy is that people can make simple changes in their daily practices to be healthier and over time, the changes become natural.
Some examples are parking further at work to add daily steps, removing the bread basket at restaurants, removing the salt shaker from tables and substituting fruit for sugary snacks.
Organizations that are central in daily living, such as employers, government entities, grocery stores, restaurants, residential communities, churches and civic organizations are changing practices to be healthier and have become Blue Zones recognized.
To date, 234 organizations have gained Blue Zones Project recognition or approval in Collier and Lee counties, yet more than 500 organizations are participating in the initiative, according to Kate Walter, with the local Blue Zones Project.
In addition to "wine @ 5" as one of the Power 9, the compound resveratrol found in the skin of grapes, is known to protect the body against damage to blood vessels, may reduce the "bad" cholesterol of low-density lipoprotein and may prevent blood clots, according to the Mayo Clinic.
"Some research shows that resveratrol could be linked to a lower risk of inflammation and blood clotting, which can lead to heart disease," according to a Mayo Clinic article published in January. "But other studies found no benefits from resveratrol in preventing heart disease. More research is needed to determine if resveratrol lowers the risk of inflammation and blood clotting."
In 2017, Medical News Today published an article that referenced numerous studies about resveratrol and how it may offer various health benefits, from boosting heart health to preventing some kinds of cancer.
Researchers at John Hopkins University School of Medicine found resveratrol may protect the brain from stroke damage.
Still, a global study published in 2018 in the international medical journal, The Lancet, concluded there is no safe level of drinking alcohol.
The study that was part of the annual Global Burden of Disease, assessed alcohol related health outcomes and patterns from 1990 to 2016 in 195 counties. Nearly 3 million deaths globally were attributed to alcohol use. The study did not distinguish between beer, wine and alcohol.
The Blue Zones Project website shares how the residents of Sardinia, Italy, are famous for their daily consumption of a regional red wine called Cannonau, which has two times the level of flavonoids, or antioxidants, that may lower risk of heart attacks.
Wine in moderation also may be beneficial if it is consumed with a Mediterranean diet that includes greens, beans, nuts, olive oil and whole grains and low consumption of meat, according to The Blue Zones.
Buettner teamed up with Healthways, a health consulting firm, in 2009 to develop and launch a detailed program to help guide communities to better health and wellness practices. The Blue Zones Project now works with Sharecare, a digital health company in Atlanta.
Early adopters of the Blue Zones Project include Albert Lea, Minnesota; and Spencer and Waterloo, Iowa, along with other cities in Iowa. In addition, projects are underway in Hawaii, Oklahoma, Oregon and Wisconsin. All told, more than 42 communities in nine states have launched Blue Zones Projects.
The NCH Healthcare System is underwriting the costs of the Blue Zones Project in Southwest Florida.
The compound resveratrol, found in the skin of grapes, is known to protect the body against damage to blood vessels, may reduce the "bad" cholesterol of low-density lipoprotein and may prevent blood clots, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Texto completo: The Academy Awards better hope its decision to televise Sunday's ceremony without a host doesn't come back to bite Oscar on his gold-plated backside.
The last time the show went without an official emcee was 30 years ago - and its interminable opening number highlighted by a disastrous song and dance duet with actor Rob Lowe and an unknown dressed as Snow White resulted in the most cringeworthy moment in the history of a show known for its myriad of cringeworthy moments.
The 1989 ceremony climaxed with "Rain Man" winning best picture, its fourth Oscar of the night. But viewers had to first endure Lowe - then 24 and better known for appearing on a sex tape with a 16-year-old girl than his movie credits - crooning an off-key rendition of "Proud Mary" with "Snow White," who performed in an annoyingly high-pitched voice that sounded like Betty Boop on helium.
The opening was 11 minutes of televised torture for more than 1 billion viewers worldwide, yet the now-infamous duet was hardly the only lowlight.
As the set transformed into a facsimile of L.A.'s famed Cocoanut Grove nightclub, TV talk-show host Merv Griffin sang the cheesy "I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts" in a British accent while Old Hollywood icons like Vincent Price, Cyd Charisse, Roy Rogers and Dorothy Lamour were trotted onstage like aging show ponies amid high-stepping dancers dressed like theater ushers.
It took years for the industry to look back and laugh at the Oscar night debacle, which was the brainchild of "Grease" producer Allan Carr, who was bent on shaking up what he saw as a staid, outdated event.
But while the concept of honoring Hollywood history with a singing Snow White seemed harmlessly dopey, it made the movie establishment pretty darn grumpy.
Not only did critics pan Carr's misguided vision - which put a permanent black mark on an otherwise successful career - Disney promptly filed a copyright infringement suit against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for using Snow White's image without permission.
It got worse - a letter slamming the ceremony as "an embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion picture industry" was signed by 17 prominent Hollywood heavyweights, including Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Julie Andrews and Gregory Peck.
"It is neither fitting nor acceptable that the best work in motion pictures be acknowledged in such a demeaning fashion," the letter said.
In a newspaper interview last year, Lowe recalled the moment he realized the number had gone off the rails.
"I remember vividly looking out in the audience and seeing (director) Barry Levinson, who on that particular evening was the belle of the ball with 'Rain Man,' and I could see him very clearly pop-eyed and mouthing, 'What the (expletive)?'" Lowe told The New York Times. "But to be a successful actor, you have to have a big dollop of self-denial, so I managed to convince myself that I'd killed it."
Lowe's career did actually survive the fiasco (not to mention his sex tape scandal). But the actress who played Snow White - San Diego native Eileen Bowman, then 22 - wasn't so lucky. She never recovered from what should have been a huge break and has appeared in a smattering of small TV and film roles over the years.
"These poor people were like, 'What the hell are you doing?' " Bowman said in a magazine interview years later about the movie stars sitting in L.A.'s Shrine Auditorium that night.
"I remember sitting in my condo ... watching the news - and the Snow White number was all that was on the news. I had no idea," Bowman said. "My phone never stopped ringing. It was awful."

Ayanna Pressley joins protesters blasting Trump over emergency declaration

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE — Days after a controversial national emergency declaration from President Trump, hundreds of demonstrators weathered the snow and cold Monday afternoon in Harvard Square to protest policies of his administration.
US Representative Ayanna Pressley was among those to dismiss Trump's recent declaration of a national emergency as “fake." Pressley rattled off a series of problems she considered to be real emergencies: a dearth of affordable housing, soaring drug prices, gun violence, voter suppression, and climate change, among others. She called Trump's declaration “constitutional vandalism" and an “abuse of power."
“We will do everything to stop it," the former Boston city councilor told the crowd gathered near Out of Town News, to cheers.
Pressley was not alone in those sentiments. Nancy Ryan, a 72-year-old retiree from Cambridge, was among the demonstrators outraged at Trump's declaration. Ryan, sporting a bunch of pins that read “Not my president," was troubled by Trump's border policy.
“I feel like it's an imperial grab for power," she said. “I worry about the courts at this point, whether they're going to uphold the Constitution or let him get away with this stuff. It's terrifying to me."
The demonstration was one of many gatherings across the country Monday to assail Trump's declaration as undemocratic and anti-immigrant.
White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told "Fox News Sunday" that Trump is prepared to issue the first veto of his term if Congress votes to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency along the US-Mexico border, according to The Associated Press.
On Friday, Trump declared a national emergency along the southern border and predicted his administration would defend it all the way to the Supreme Court, the AP reported.
The declaration gave Trump access to billions of dollars to build a border wall that Congress refused to give up, setting up a Capitol Hill clash over the separation of powers.
The move drew bipartisan criticism and multiple legal challenges. After lawmakers in both parties blocked his requests for billions of dollars to fulfill his signature campaign pledge, Trump's declared national emergency shifts billions of federal dollars earmarked for military construction to the border.
Trump framed the declaration as a way to staunch a flow of drugs, criminals, and illegal immigrants coming across the border, a problem considered to be a serious national security threat, according to The New York Times.
Democrats are planning to introduce a resolution disapproving of the declaration once Congress returns to session and it is likely to pass both chambers. Several Republican senators are already indicating they would vote against Trump — though there do not yet appear to be enough votes to override a veto by the president.
After addressing the crowd, Pressley said a real crisis the country is facing is the humanitarian one at the border. It's unclear how many children are being separated from their families, she said. Illegal crossings are at a record low, she said, but people are being detained who are not criminals.
“They are being detained simply because they are immigrants," she said.
She called for “compassion and comprehensive immigration reform."
Mayor Marc McGovern of Cambridge urged those who attended Monday's rally to continue to resist Trump's politics and rhetoric. “We cannot stop when we have a person in the White House who is bent on hatred and racism and division," he said.
On Presidents' Day, some of the demonstrators held signs. One read: “We have nothing to fear but Trump himself." Another: “No wall." A third: “Power always corrupts." Others held orange cartoon balloons of the president.
When the brass band honked out songs as snow fell, the tuba player's instrument featured the message, “Your emergency is a lie!" Chants from the crowd included “Enough is enough!" A demonstrator wore a vest that said “Make Racists Afraid Again."
Gail Epstein, a 66-year-old Cambridge resident who helped organize the demonstration, shared Ryan's concerns. She called his declaration “a complete overreach" and said Trump's values did not match those of the demonstrators. “I don't think that Trump deciding he wants to put a wall up is a national emergency," she said.
Said Melrose resident Carol Sardo of Trump's declaration: “It seems to be bogus. That's one of the reasons we're out here."

Texto completo: As the food editor of The New York Times and the founding editor of NYT Cooking, I spend a lot of time bringing together cooks, reporters, chefs and critics to lay out strict instructions for how best to prepare specific dishes. These recipes take a particular form: a list of ingredients followed by step-by-step directions for how to use them to result in a finished dish. I think of these recipes as sheet music, a form of notation that allows home cooks to recreate the cooking of others, just as a printed chord chart allows Mike from Sheboygan to play the Beatles repertoire in his den, passingly well.
But I don't just cook with recipes, and I am not alone. Indeed, cooking without recipes is a kitchen skill same as cutting vegetables into dice or flipping an omelet. It's a proficiency to develop, a way to improve your confidence in the kitchen and to make the act of cooking fun when sometimes it seems like a chore.
For the past four years, I included one of these no-recipe recipes, an invitation for you to improvise in the kitchen, in every Wednesday edition of What to Cook, a newsletter I write for The Times. What follows are some highlights from that archive, suggestions for things you might cook yourself or for as many people you have or don't have at the table, as you like. SAM SIFTON

Texto completo: The release of a new album by the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams has been canceled amid a report that the F.B.I. is looking into his communications with an underage fan.
Following an article published by The New York Times on Wednesday about Adams's treatment of women, from a teenage fan to his ex-wife, Mandy Moore, F.B.I. agents in the bureau's New York office took the first steps to open a criminal investigation. They are responding to an accusation that Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with the teenager, who said her communication with the singer began when she was 14 and ended when she was 16. They never met in person, and through a lawyer, Adams has denied ever engaging in sexual conversations with someone he knew was underage.
[Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.]
Adams, a prolific Grammy-nominated rock and alternative country singer, had previously announced plans to release three albums this year via Blue Note Records and his own Pax-Am label. On Thursday, the first of those new albums, "Big Colors," which had been scheduled for April 19, was put on hold indefinitely, according to music retailers.
Bull Moose, a record store chain in Maine and New Hampshire, posted on Twitter a message it had received from a supplier stating the album "has been canceled effectively immediately." A representative for the store confirmed it had been alerted by a sales representative for Universal Music Group that the album was canceled. Capitol Music Group, a division of Universal Music, which was scheduled to distribute Adams's new albums, declined to comment.
SRCVinyl, another seller, said it was offering refunds for customers who had already purchased "Big Colors," and a pre-order page on the Pax-Am website was also removed.
Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with him on Thursday.
In a statement, Benson Amps said it was "saddened and surprised by the recent allegations" against Adams and would no longer move forward with the development of a Ryan Adams signature model. JHS Pedals, a guitar effects company, said it would cease all collaboration with Adams and discontinue his signature pedal, adding that it would rebrand its current inventory "with a portion of the sale going towards the fight against sexual abuse and misconduct."

Adams was also accused in The Times's article of a pattern of emotional abuse and manipulation, in which he offered career assistance and credibility to young female musicians, only to sometimes turn harassing and retaliatory. Adams denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of the reporting, though he apologized on Twitter "to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally."
In January, Adams, who has released 16 studio albums and a much-discussed cover version of Taylor Swift's "1989," announced a deluge of new music in a nontraditional way: via political reporters. Using well-known staff members from The Washington Post, CBS, NBC and Politico, Adams spread information about his three new albums, including "Big Colors" and a follow-up titled "Wednesdays."
He had also announced 10 European tour dates beginning March 30 in Dublin. As of Friday, tickets were still available for purchase.
"Big Colors" was produced by Don Was, the president of Blue Note Records, and was scheduled to feature John Mayer, Bob Mould and Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Guest musicians slated for "Wednesdays," which was not given a release date, included Emmylou Harris and Jason Isbell, who wrote on Twitter this week that he believed the women speaking out against Adams.
Other former collaborators have also come forward. The musician and model Karen Elson, who toured with Adams in 2017, said in a post on Instagram that she "also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams." But she added, "I'm not quite brave enough yet to speak about my specifics."
Asked about the allegations against Adams, the singer-songwriter Liz Phair, with whom Adams said he was working on a double album in 2017, posted on Twitter: "My experience was nowhere near as personally involving, but yes the record ended and the similarities are upsetting."

McCabe backtracks on Rosenstein and 25th Amendment claim

Texto completo: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is backtracking on the suggestion that he engaged in discussions about whether President Trump could be removed from office under the 25th Amendment.

McCabe’s spokeswoman released a statement Friday that said McCabe’s statements about such conversations “have been taken out of context and misrepresented.”

The New York Times reported in September that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had discussed using the amendment and wearing a wire to record his conversations with the president. Rosenstein denied the report.

Whether such conversations had taken place made headlines again Thursday when “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley said McCabe told him there were meetings “in which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment."

McCabe’s spokeswoman, Melissa Schwartz, said the former Justice Department official was only confirming a discussion that had been previously reported and that new reports have been overblown.

“To clarify, at no time did Mr. McCabe participate in any extended discussions about the use of the 25th Amendment, nor is he aware of any such discussions. He was present and participated in a discussion that included a comment by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein regarding the 25th Amendment,” she said.

The anecdote is not included in McCabe’s forthcoming book, “The Threat,” she said. The book is set to be released Tuesday.

Socialism has already done damage in US

Texto completo: President Donald Trump was principled and politically astute to address, in his State of the Union, the horrors taking place now in Venezuela, and then to declare:
"Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
Venezuela is indeed a poster child for what happens when a nation's economic machinery falls under political control.
Over the last five years, per The Wall Street Journal, Venezuela's economy shrank by 35 percent and poverty tripled from 48 to 87 percent.
According to Gallup, 71 percent of Venezuelans say they can't afford food, 47 percent say they can't afford shelter, just 15 percent say they are satisfied with the availability of quality health care, and 35 percent say they are satisfied with their standard of living.
Thirty-six percent of Venezuelans, 51 percent of those between 15 and 29, say they would leave the country permanently if they could.
But if it is so clear that socialism is a formula for economic disaster, why does the idea still conjure up support?
In a Gallup poll of last year, 57 percent of Democrats, compared to 16 percent of Republicans, say they have a "positive view of socialism."
Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman says it's semantics.
Krugman mocks Trump, saying that "there is essentially no one in American political life who advocates such things" as government control of industry, as is the case in Venezuela.
When Democrats say "socialism," says Krugman, they really mean "social democracy" — a market economy with a social safety net and use of the tax system as an equalizer.
The issue really isn't how we technically define socialism. The issue is really the extent to which we are free.
What difference is it really if a firm is privately owned, but the government has vast latitude to regulate what it does? Or if a private firm pays me but government taxes away a large chunk of what I earn?
Venezuela is, of course, the extreme case. Total collapse as result of political despots taking over everything.
But socialism is not like good wine, which, in moderation, might not hurt and might even be beneficial.
Every step in which economic freedom is cut back bears costs.
We see what is happening now, as the U.S. economy surges back to life as a result of cutting back regulation and taxes.
But our nation has not totally escaped the Venezuelan phenomenon.
America has entire communities in distress for the same reasons that Venezuela has fallen apart — political control over economic affairs. Life in our poor communities is in the grip of socialism, not capitalism.
Government housing, government health care, government schools, government welfare programs.
There are 31 million people living in areas of high economic distress, now designated as "opportunity zones." The average poverty rate in these zones is 28.7 percent. The average household income is 40 percent below the national average, and 36.5 percent of prime-age adults are not working. Fifty-six percent of these 31 million are non-white minorities.
The president's new opportunity zone initiative, providing tax incentives to direct investment capital into these neighborhoods, aims to change realities with the same passion that the president spoke against socialism for the rest of the country in his State of the Union address.
How do countries wind up going in the wrong direction?
British playwright George Bernard Shaw captured it when he said, "A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul."
Political demagogues tap into the frustrations of those who are struggling, or tap into the ambitions of those who long for power, and sell them Hollywood dreams — and lies — of a better life. Once they convince them to turn over power, the nightmare begins.
Life has no shortcuts. Freedom, hard work and personal responsibility are the one and only path to prosperity.

Democrats should take lessons from 2016 GOP field

Texto completo: For the second presidential cycle in a row, a crowded field of candidates has emerged in the race to claim a major party's nomination. The sheer number of hats in the ring could produce a nominee outside the small coterie most pundits expect to win out.
Dubious? Just think about 2016.
In the last presidential election, most of the Republican candidates were seen as beacons of the "establishment." With Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, John Kasich and Chris Christie all competing to win the hearts and minds of more moderate GOP primary voters, Donald Trump won by collecting support from Republicans with an appetite for a different brand of candidate — and he succeeded. In other words, the crowded field opened the door for an outsider who was (and could still be) largely out of step with many others inside his own party.
This time, the situation is flipped. Democrats are the party with the crowded field. But maybe more important, many Democratic candidates are not focusing on winning over moderate voters. Quite the opposite; they're keyed on winning over the Democratic Party's base voters and others on the far left. If history repeats itself, these candidates will end up slicing that electorate into such small portions that they could open the door for a competitor with a different message and outlook.
No one knows who will emerge as the Democratic nominee, and the widely held presumption that the 2016 race would be yet another contest between someone named Bush and someone named Clinton should give prognosticators pause. But the crowded field among Democratic candidates signals that the unexpected today might seem inevitable tomorrow. Voters eager to see a candidate emerge with a promise of getting Democrats and Republicans to work collaboratively should stay engaged.
Nancy Jacobson is a founder of the nonprofit organization No Labels.
What others are saying Dean Obeidallah, CNN.com: "President Donald Trump is now confronted with a gang of women who are all gunning for him. And if he responds in usual Trump fashion, with his no-holds-barred attacks, he could drive away more female voters than he did in the 2018 midterms. That could potentially not only be devastating for Trump, but also for many Republicans on the 2020 ballot."
Tara McGowan, The Hill: "Trump's campaign has excelled at leveraging digital ad dollars to keep the controversies surrounding the Trump administration from reaching his supporter base online. ... Coupled with Trump's own tweets, thousands of Facebook ads placed by his re-election campaign and dozens of conservative 'media outlets' driving the same narrative, Trump's chosen message blanketed the feeds and phones of voters nationwide."
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "If I were Trump, I would fear Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Either would be well-positioned to take back blue-collar states Trump needs like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa. They could also play well in the Sunbelt suburbs of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. And if I were the other 2020 Democrats, I'd be studying how Klobuchar and Brown have succeeded where so many other Democrats have been failing."

Texto completo: Four years ago, an underwater volcano erupted in the South Pacific Ocean, creating a new island. And NASA took notice.
The island’s evolution could hold clues to how water might have shaped similar features on Mars billions of years ago, NASA officials believed, so the space agency began collecting satellite photos to track how the elements were carving and clawing away at the land.
The images yielded insights into how the island was eroding, but the story they told was limited. NASA could wring more information from those photographs with measurements taken from the ground, but James Garvin, chief scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, could not justify the cost of sending a team. Then an opportunity presented itself.
The Sea Education Association, a study abroad program, was planning to take a group of college students and faculty and staff members to the island, and NASA was welcome to hitch a ride.
Garvin jumped at the chance, sending along Dan Slayback, a research scientist for NASA who had been working on the effort to track the island’s progression.
Slayback sailed on that trip in fall, finding an island of black rock that was, to his surprise, also teeming with life.
“It was very dramatic,” he said. “Just beautifully dramatic.”
The island, part of Tonga, is about 500 acres in size and about 1,300 miles northeast of New Zealand. It has not yet been named, but is unofficially referred to as Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai, a combination of the names of the two older, uninhabited islands it sits between. (A land bridge connects all three.)
Its most prominent features are a turquoise lake and a croissant-shaped ridge - the remnants of a cone made from hardened ash - that stretches about 400 feet high and about a mile across, Slayback said.
After spending years staring at satellite photographs of the island, he was overwhelmed to finally see the breathtaking landscape up close in early October. He was also eager to get to work.
The satellite photos reveal how the island has eroded over time, but their level of detail is limited without 3D points of reference as context. So, with the help of the students, Slayback roamed the island with a finely tuned GPS device, recording the location of various features visible in the photographs with an accuracy of a few inches.
Those measurements will allow the NASA team to refine the models it had created and more narrowly track erosion going forward, Garvin said.
“Instead of a map with a resolution the size of a chair that you’d sit at your desk in, we have a map of the topography, the three-dimensionality, of this new island that’s good to the size of a few fingers,” he said.
With those finer models, scientists can better compare the changing shape of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai to volcanic shapes and erosion patterns on Mars to better understand the degree to which water was present there and the role it might have played in shaping the landscape.
In addition to helping Slayback with the measurements, students and faculty collected rock samples and documented the vegetation growing on the island. They were also surprised to find a thriving bird population.
“The number of birds, the number of bird eggs, the number of baby chicks was astounding,” said Rachel Scudder, chief scientist for the Sea Education Association. “There were places where we could not actually get up to the wall of the caldera for fear of stepping on baby chicks.”
The volcanic eruption that birthed the island occurred in December 2014, sending ash as high as 30,000 feet into the air and disrupting flights. The island was formed in part when that ash fell back to earth and hardened after mixing with warm water, Garvin said.
When the island was created, the NASA team thought it might not survive much longer than a decade. (That was part of the reason it could not justify sending a team there.) Now, after sampling rocks from the island, visiting it and watching it weather the elements, the team expects it to remain for anywhere from a few decades to hundreds of years.
“Right now, things look good,” Garvin said. “The island may be cementing itself.”

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
How was it that I had never heard of burn pits? Certainly these open-air trash fires, which were everywhere in Iraq and Afghanistan during the conflicts in those countries, had been written about, been the subject of lawsuits and been blamed for sickening scores, if not hundreds of veterans, of those wars.
Yet somehow, I had managed to miss the story -- like much of the nation, I suspect.
I took on a new beat, veterans affairs, at the end of last year. It interested me because it combined many of my past reporting gigs -- health care, the West, politics and Congress -- while introducing me to a culture I know little about.
So it often goes with veterans, a population our nation reveres but often forgets. We understand that they have high rates of suicide, post-traumatic stress and opioid use. But we are less aware of their daily challenges, including predatory lenders and for-profit colleges, that target them specifically.
Many things probably contribute to the attention deficit. One may be that journalists sometimes lose sight of stories outside of our expertise. We often silo ourselves in our coverage areas. In that sense, we're regular readers. We gravitate toward our pre-existing interests.
My interest in covering veterans issues began while I was working as a live events editor for The New York Times, programming panels with Times journalists around the country alongside our At War team. Whether it was in Washington, with Senator Tammy Duckworth before a sold-out crowd, or in an intimate setting in San Diego with the writer of "American Sniper," I saw that The Times had a chance to build an audience in the veterans community that we were not seeing at other events.
That, and my curiosity particularly about those who served in the post-9/11 conflicts, also drew me in. Together with my colleague Dave Philipps, who has been covering veterans and other military issues from Colorado Springs, and with our reporters on the Pentagon beat, I would have a chance to go deeper and broader.
When I was establishing new sources, there were many veterans service organizations I could turn to. In writing about veterans, I found that they -- and those who care for them -- come to you quickly via email and Twitter, eager to share experiences and to engage.
One theme struck me right away: the differing points of view and needs of this post-9/11 generation of vets, several of whom are now representatives in the House, and some of the older veteran population. Many younger veterans, for instance, are far more interested in education and employment issues than health care policy, and in giving back to their communities -- continuing their service, in their view -- than advocacy work.
I came across the issue of burning toxic trash -- and how it may have affected the health of those deployed during the post-9/11 wars -- when talking to veterans' advocates. The pits surfaced frequently in my conversations with veterans service organizations and on Capitol Hill; there is even a bipartisan burn pits caucus. Yet the health care data on injuries related to burn pits remains inconclusive and anecdotal, which has made it a difficult subject to report on, and for the courts to adjudicate.
Speaking with veterans who believe they have been injured by the pits of flaming garbage was difficult -- they believe they went into conflicts understanding that they might not survive deployment, but they were largely unprepared for illnesses surfacing years after their service.
This is, in some sense, an analogy for many veterans' points of view on the cultural divide between civilians and the 1 percent of Americans in the military.
They feel forgotten and frustrated, and many health care professionals feel similarly, even when conflicted about what the evidence tells us about burn pit exposure. Still, those personal stories have affected many members of Congress, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who got behind legislation largely because of one or two veterans in their community who are sick or dead.
"I was just trying to be a good marine," said Ryne Robinson, 33, a veteran with a brain tumor he and others believe stemmed from his burn pit exposure in Iraq. "The day you sign that paper and go to boot camp, you do what you're told. 'Suck it up, buttercup."'

Texto completo: RICHMOND, Va. -- To Constance Cordovilla, the president of the Virginia National Organization for Women, the two sexual assault allegations against Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax are not just grounds for him to resign -- the detailed claims also demand that women side with his accusers.
"It would set back survivors if we don't because the message to them would be, 'Here's another case where they're not believed,"' said Ms. Cordovilla, a longtime labor and women's rights advocate, drawing a bright line between the charges against Mr. Fairfax and the Virginia governor and attorney general who admitted they once donned blackface. "This is a criminal charge, it's not like saying I had a picture in my yearbook 40 years ago."
But to Khadijah Vasser, a 23-year-old employee at the Virginia Bar Association and recent University of Virginia graduate, the matter is less clear-cut.
"I think it's really unreasonable to ask him to resign so early without having a thorough investigation," Ms. Vasser said of Mr. Fairfax, who denies both claims. She added, "I don't want to see him go just yet because of something that may or may not be true."
As Virginia comes to terms with the possibility that its executive branch for the next three years could include two men who once mocked African-Americans and a third accused of rape, there is an unmistakable racial divide among progressive female advocates and elected officials about whether to resolutely side with Mr. Fairfax's accusers or to withhold judgment. White women like Ms. Cordovilla tend to unhesitatingly line up with the accusers while African-Americans like Ms. Vasser want to hear a fuller airing of the charges against Mr. Fairfax, who is black, before choosing sides.
These divisions between two vital constituencies for the Democratic Party are agonizing to party officials. "It is not a race issue, it's a sexual assault issue," Representative Jennifer Wexton of Virginia said.
But Ms. Wexton personifies why it is imperative that Virginia Democrats resolve what has become an almost unbearably painful dilemma.
She and two other Democratic women won Republican-held seats last year and will need the support of both women and African-Americans in order to win next year in their first re-elections. The same is true this fall: With all 140 seats in the state Legislature on the ballot and Democrats on the verge of winning majorities in both chambers, the party will reclaim power only with robust turnout from the same blocs.
And about those state races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in 2021? Democrats won't win them without some of their most dependable voters.
The matter is so delicate for Virginia Democrats that the House caucus sent an email message Monday to members warning them that a New York Times reporter was outside the chamber wanting to talk to female lawmakers. A picture of the reporter and a series of talking points about how to handle questions about Mr. Fairfax were included in the message, which was forwarded by a Democrat who requested anonymity to share an internal document.
And in a sign that House Democrats are uneasy about forcing their members, who include 16 African-Americans, to take a firm position about whether to believe the two accusers, the talking points included a proposed answer sidestepping the question.
The allegations "against our Lieutenant Governor are credible and extremely serious and it is why my colleagues and I have called for him to step down," the talking points said. "It took great courage for both women to share their stories. As Democrats, and as Virginians, we must continue to stand up and speak out against sexual assault."
But few lawmakers in the state Capitol were willing to be even that expansive, many of them avoiding questions entirely.
Asked about the skittishness, Delegate Eileen Filler-Corn, the minority leader, dodged that question, too.
"We were sent here to do a job and represent 80,000 people and that's what we're trying to do, so we're staying very focused on the job at hand," she said.
Privately, Democratic lawmakers have been more candid with one another: A Northern Virginia legislator who had planned to file impeachment articles against Mr. Fairfax this week backed off after a handful of African-American members implored him, on a Sunday night conference call that grew tense, to keep the issue out of the legislative domain.
But Ms. Wexton, who was one of the first high-ranking Virginia Democrats to proclaim last week that she believed Mr. Fairfax's first accuser, said the party had to police its own if it is to take a hard line on Republican transgressions.
"We have to use the same standard with our friends as we do with the folks across the aisle, otherwise it's hypocritical," she said. "We can't engage in whataboutism."
Yet Courtney A. Hill, an Arlington-based political strategist who works with and tries to help elect black candidates in Virginia, argued that the focus on the allegations against Mr. Fairfax had been stirred by people who did not want to see another black governor in the state.
"We had Northam and Herring in blackface and standing next to K.K.K. members and now the conversation has shifted to Justin and Justin entirely, and Ralph is going on his apology tour," Ms. Hill said. "I think race is helping shift that conversation. It doesn't sit right with me, and it doesn't make sense to a lot of people who look like me."
Chelsea Higgs Wise, a social justice activist who is black, said that she had campaigned for both Mr. Northam and Mr. Fairfax and that this was tearing her apart.
"It's causing a lot of tears," she said.
On the one hand, she said she felt it was important to believe sexual assault survivors and make sure they were heard, more so when they are black because their stories are often ignored. But she also had to consider the context of how the American justice system treats African-Americans, she said.
"It really is a terrible position to be in," said Ms. Wise, 34, "to believe women, but to also uphold blackness as a priority."
It is an even more awkward matter for black female legislators, for reasons that are both political and deeply personal. Many of them represent districts that are heavily African-American and in which the most dependable Democratic voters are women. And these lawmakers are deeply conscious of the history of black men in America being wrongfully accused of sexual misconduct.
Lashrecse Aird, who was the youngest woman ever elected to the state House when she won her seat in 2015, acknowledged that conversations at the intersection of race and gender "are always sensitive to have." But Ms. Aird, who is black, said the state needed to use the scandals involving Mr. Fairfax, Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark R. Herring to grow on both fronts.
"How are we going to take everything that's happened and move Virginia forward," she said.
What frustrates Erin Matson, an abortion rights activist in Arlington, is what it will mean to Virginia women if Mr. Fairfax remains lieutenant governor, a post that includes the high-profile role of presiding over the State Senate every day the General Assembly is in session.
"When we say we believe women and we trust women, we need to set an example for women and girls throughout the commonwealth who deserve better," said Ms. Matson, who is white.
The only good outcome to what has been a humiliating and painful episode for Virginia Democrats, say many party officials, would be the election or elevation of more women, particularly minorities.
Few in the Capitol can speak to what a difference it makes to have more women in public life as Delegate Vivian Watts can. The senior-most woman in the House, Ms. Watts was first elected in 1981, when the Legislature was still dominated by holdovers from the segregationist, and white male-dominated, political machine once led by Harry F. Byrd.
In a brief interview between meetings, Ms. Watts said the stain on Virginia's three executives had "absolutely" underscored how crucial it was to elect more women in the next round of state elections.
And then she noted how the 2017 legislative elections had enlarged the number of women in the 100-member House to 28 from 17. The gains drastically reshaped the culture of the chamber, which added lactation rooms for new mothers and saw the formation of a Parents Caucus.
"It creates an incredibly different atmosphere," Ms. Watts said, and "an incredibly different tone."

on Canal Trail
FARMINGTON - Police recovered a body Tuesday along the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail but aren't confirming it is a 58-year-old East Granby man missing since Monday until the state medical examiner's office does an autopsy.
Trevor French, 58, told a family member about 3 p.m. Monday that he was going for a hike at a trailhead for the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail in East Granby, police said. When he had not returned by 5:30 p.m. and had not contacted the family member, she decided to call police.
At least five different agencies, including one from out of state, participated in the search.
Trooper Tanya Compagnone said Tuesday afternoon "the body of a deceased male has been found in the area of the searches." She didn't specify where the man was found. The body was removed to the medical examiner's office.
A reverse 911 call was sent out to East Granby residents telling them to watch for French, who is white with brown eyes and gray hair. He weighs about 180 pounds, state police said. Police also activated a silver alert.
Search teams with dogs went out to the area and looked for French into the early morning hours, Compagnone said.
The searchers included search and rescue teams, state troopers from Connecticut and Massachusetts, East Granby police and East Granby firefighters, Compagnone said.

Man whose truck pinned 16-year-old student charged
COVENTRY - Police charged a Hartford man with reckless driving and unsafely backing up his delivery truck after they said he pinned a high school student between two vehicles at Coventry High School in December.
Bernard Luetjen, 42, of 62 Catherine St., Hartford, turned himself in to authorities Tuesday, police said. He was released from custody on a written promise to appear in court and is scheduled to appear in Superior Court in Rockville on Feb. 26.
On Dec. 5, about 7:18 a.m., police said Luetjen backed his newspaper delivery truck into a female high school student, "pinning her for a short time between his vehicle and another vehicle," Coventry police Chief Mark Palmer said Tuesday.
The student was getting out of her parent's car at the time of the accident. The van driver had been delivering The New York Times, which the Library Media Center receives daily, police said.
The 16-year-old was taken to Connecticut Children's Medical Center with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said.

Man hurt in I-84 crash
TOLLAND - A man was seriously injured in a one-car, fiery crash on Interstate 84 in Tolland late Monday, state police said.
Jason Pfeiffer, 37, of Farmstead Lane in Windsor, was driving a 2000 Honda Accord east about 10:50 p.m. when he lost control, they said.
The Honda left the travel lanes, struck a guardrail and slid into the woods before coming to a stop against a fence, state police said. The car erupted in flames.
Pfeiffer was removed from the car and taken by ground ambulance to Rockville General Hospital, Tolland fire officials said. He then was airlifted by Life Star helicopter to the Connecticut Burn Center at Bridgeport Hospital to be treated for severe burns.
He was listed in critical condition Tuesday morning, hospital spokesman John Cappiello said.

Woman with drugs crashes, flees
DANBURY - A woman was caught with unprescribed narcotics, police said, after fleeing the scene of a crash early Tuesday.
Police said the crash occurred at 1:18 a.m. on East Avenue, near Park Hill Avenue, when a car turned in front of another vehicle, causing a collision.
One driver fled the scene as the other driver, who suffered minor injuries, waited for police. That driver refused medical attention at the scene.
Using information obtained from an eyewitness, police located the suspect vehicle less than a quarter-mile away on Walnut Avenue. Police said the vehicle was surrounded by empty beer cans and abandoned when they found it.
Officers searched the area and found a vehicle running in a nearby driveway off Park Hill Avenue. Inside the car, police found a man in the driver's seat and the registered owner of the suspect vehicle, Leah Lalama, in the passenger side.
The driver told police that Lalama, 26, had come up to him moments earlier and asked to use his cellphone.
Lalama, who police said appeared to be intoxicated, was taken from the car and cuffed. She refused to perform sobriety tests and allegedly dropped to the ground and began yelling when officers tried to lead her to their cruiser. Lalama's erratic behavior did not end there, police said.
"Upon arrival at headquarters she continued her unusual behavior, taking off her shirt and bra and repeatedly exposing her breasts," said police spokesman Lt. Terry Blake.
Lalama, of Weindorf Drive in Danbury, was charged with possession of controlled substance, failure to keep narcotics in their original container, resisting arrest, evading responsibility and failure to grant right of way at an intersection. She was held on $5,000 bond and given a court date of Feb. 21.

Spill closes down I-91
WETHERSFIELD - State police had to close a portion of Interstate 91 in Wethersfield on Tuesday evening after a tractor-trailer overturned and leaked fuel onto the road.
The accident occurred about 7:30 p.m. when a truck traveling southbound on I-91 near Exit 26 overturned. It is unclear whether there were any injuries.
State police said the truck was carrying 1,900 gallons of fuel and that it was leaking out of the cargo tank.
The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection was called to the scene to assess the damage, and a sand truck was called to sand the road.

Texto completo: TOKYO -- For decades, a prized, 400-year-old Japanese bonsai tree has been shaped, watered and cared for with all of the precision needed for a priceless piece of art.
In the wrong hands, it could die within a week.
The tree, a 33-inch-tall Shimpaku, was among seven trees stolen from the garden of Seiji Iimura, 54, the fifth-generation owner of a bonsai shop in the city of Kawaguchi, near Tokyo, in January.
All together, the stolen trees were worth more than 10 million yen, or about $90,000.
Keeping bonsai trees requires a potent mixture of dedication and skill, commonly creating a deep emotional connection for their owners. Mr. Iimura had looked after the Shimpaku meticulously for 25 years.
In interviews, Mr. Iimura and his wife begged the thieves to return the trees, and to make sure to water them in the meantime.
"Bonsai are like our children," said Fuyumi Iimura, Mr. Iimura's wife. "They are our children who have been living for 400 years. I now feel like our limbs were taken away, and miss them every day."
The police have been unable to track down the thieves. Mr. Iimura said his large, 3,000-pot garden had been open -- the couple never considered the possibility that someone might steal one -- but they have since installed several cameras. They'll soon construct a fence, and are considering adding a siren.
Keeping a bonsai tree is as much an art as making a painting of one, with owners using wiring and pruning to shape the trees, often over several decades, into miniature versions of those found outdoors. They have a similar appeal as doll houses or model cars, shrinking something towering and magnificent so it can fit into a home or garden.
Long associated with Japan, the tradition of caring for the trees started in China around the year 1000 and has spread to dedicated owners across the globe. Several previous theft victims have mourned their stolen trees in a similar way to the Iimuras, portraying it as a familial loss.
"It's not the money, these plants were like children to me," Suzanne Berv, of Great Neck, N.Y., told The New York Times in 1978 after eight of her bonsai trees were taken.
"It's almost like somebody kidnapped one of your kids," Fred Miyahara told KPBS, a public radio station in San Diego, in 2013, when a tree he had cared for was stolen.
"To have them stolen is kind of like having your babies stolen," Richard Fenn, a retiree in Tauranga, told The New Zealand Herald in 2017, when his collection fell victim to thieves. "They can take my shirts or my car, but to have these stolen is quite heartbreaking."
The tree that was stolen from Mr. Iimura was not for sale, he said, as it was "priceless."
Yuji Tamura, an editor for the Japan Bonsai Association, said the tree had once received an award at a conference and was "regarded as excellent."
"It takes a lot of work to create a beautiful bonsai," he said. "The trees haven't lived in pots for 400 or 500 years. Such old trees as Shimpaku or Ezo spruce are taken from mountains, and are taken care of for decades to become beautiful bonsai."
While the trees can be sold for hefty sums on the black market, Mr. Iimura said he hoped international news coverage would make it more difficult for the thieves to sell the trees.
"All we want is the bonsai to be returned," he said.

Texto completo: NORMAL  The 12th year of Illinois State University's Red Note New Music Festival is now underway through Thursday.
The fest combines performances from the country's leading contemporary talents, as well as guest ensembles and performers from ISU's own student/faculty resources. The remaining events, all at Kemp Recital Hall, are free and open to the public. The co-directors of the event are ISU music faculty members Carl Schimmel and Roy Magnuson.
This year's guest performers include the Fifth House Ensemble and Iridium Quartet.
The Chicago-Based Fifth House Ensemble has been praised by The New York Times for its conviction, authority, and finesse. Having pioneered the art of narrative chamber music, Fifth Houses innovative programs work to engage audiences through their connective programming and unexpected performance venues. The ensemble has been involved in artistic projects with urban neighborhoods, social service organizations, and an agricultural community to spark conversations on issues that matter. It also works with music schools and conservatories.
The Iridium Quartet, meanwhile, draws upon a rich history of more than 10 years of collaboration between its saxophonists: Paul Nolen, Marcos Colón, Paul Forsyth and Eric Lau. Iridium has commissioned and/or premiered major works by a variety of composers and released its first CD of new American music, "Xylonia," in 2014 after receiving a 2012 Aaron Copland Fund Recording Grant. In 2016, it recorded its second full-length CD, set to be released this year.
The groups will perform at these events:
7:30 p.m. Feb. 12: Fifth House Ensemble performs music by contemporary composers based throughout the U.S.
7:30 p.m. Feb. 13: Fifth House Ensemble and Iridium Quartet present a concert of premieres by the participants in the festival's composition workshop.
7:30 p.m. Feb. 14: The Iridium Quartet performs 21st-century compositions for saxophone quartet, including works commissioned by Iridium.

Texto completo: Corey Maggette has been identified as the unnamed Duke men’s basketball player who allegedly sexually assaulted Meredith Watson, USA TODAY Sports confirmed through a friend of the accuser Monday night.
Watson is the second woman to come forward to accuse Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault.
Maggette’s one year at Duke before an NBA career that stretched 14 seasons coincides with the alleged rape (1999), first reported by USA TODAY Sports on Friday. The New York Times was the first to report that Watson identified the alleged perpetrator as Maggette to a friend.
The friend, Washington, D. C. -based attorney R. Stanton Jones, confirmed in an email to USA TODAY Sports that Watson told him she was raped by Fairfax and Maggette.
“When Meredith told me she’d been raped twice at Duke, it made me realize that nothing really awful had ever happened to me in my then very young life,” Jones told USA TODAY Sports. “That realization, and the horror of what Meredith told me about what she’d been through in college, had a big impact on me then and has stuck with me ever since. ”
From the weekend: Support for Virginia's Fairfax collapses amid sexual assault claims
Maggette denied the accusation when reached by The New York Times.
"I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge," Maggette said in the statement issued through a spokesperson.
The spokesperson for Watson’s attorney, Karen Kessler, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Watson and another friend in March 2017, in which Watson named Fairfax and Maggette. The Times was unable to independently verify the message’s veracity.
"Ms. Watson came forward to address the Justin Fairfax denials," Kessler told USA TODAY Sports in a text message on Saturday when asked for specifics about the 1999 incident with the Duke player. "This is our focus and should be yours. "
Maggette has worked as a broadcaster since retiring from the NBA in 2013 and is an analyst at Fox Sports West.
"Fox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter," Fox Sports West said in a statement. "We have no further comment at this time. "
Column from Ricky Jones: Like Northam in blackface, white people who do racist things need guidance
Maggette was not part of the Los Angeles Clippers' broadcast team for Tuesday night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Ralph Lawler, the longtime voice of Clippers, told Fox Sports West viewers that Maggette had to return to Southern California to deal with a “personal matter. "
Watson’s attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, said in a statement released Friday that Watson "went to the dean, who provided no help and discouraged her from pursuing the claim further. "
Duke University also is investigating the allegation against Maggette.
"We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed," Duke said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. "We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time. "
Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said after Saturday’s game against Virginia that he had "no knowledge" of the incident until Friday. Duke will take on Louisville on Tuesday at the KFC Yum Center.
"I think there was an allegation made, right?" Krzyzewski said. "So, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but there is an allegation. "

Congress Parkway renamed Ida B. Wells Drive

Texto completo: The bright green street signs bearing her name had already been installed, and digital mapping apps already acknowledged Ida B. Wells Drive as a major downtown Chicago thoroughfare.
But on Monday, elected officials, dignitaries, award-winning journalists, activists and dozens of residents gathered at the Harold Washington Library to officially celebrate the first major Chicago street to carry the name of an African-American woman.
"She was an original boss," said Ald. Sophia King, 4th, who pushed the effort along with Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, to rename Congress Parkway, a prominent east-west artery. "She spoke truth to power and changed the landscape of Chicago and the world."
"It's bittersweet that it's has taken so long," King said. "But we are here."
Also known by her married name, Ida B. Wells-Barnett was an iconic investigative journalist who crusaded against the racist lynching of black men, pushed for women's right to vote and started numerous organizations that aimed to improve the economic and social status of African-Americans. She was born into slavery in Mississippi, but went on to be a schoolteacher and created the first kindergarten for black children.
Wells-Barnett settled in Bronzeville in 1894 after her life was threatened, and she developed a reputation as a fearless activist and political strategist. But despite her many accomplishments, innovations and devotion to social justice, her contributions and legacy went largely unacknowledged.
For many years, her name rang out in Chicago because a large public housing complex also bore it. But as a result, the name became associated with poverty and violence.
So Monday's ceremony -- held months after the City Council approved the new street moniker -- gave city leaders an opportunity to honor her in a more dignified and glorified way and shed light on her extraordinary life.
Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton spoke of how Wells-Barnett attended the first women's suffrage parade in 1913 in Washington, D.C., and refused to be sidelined because of her race. When she was asked to step aside, Wells-Barnett found her way to the Illinois group and marched out front with them.
"This woman ... was not just an inspiration to me, as a black woman in politics, but one who endured so much so that we could all stand here today in service to our communities," Stratton said. "Ida B. Wells spent her life as an activist, and seeking to ensure that women, and black women in particular, were not isolated from political movements, despite the racism and sexism we must often contend with, even to this day."
The road named for Wells-Barnett stretches from Grant Park west to the entrance to the Eisenhower Expressway. The City Council approved the name change last summer.
Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, a candidate for Chicago mayor, said Wells-Barnett was an educator in everything she did.
"Society thought it had her destiny predetermined: a life surely to be cast aside and voiceless, her name forgotten," Preckwinkle said. "Today Chicago will forever know the name of Ida B. Wells. ... She held up a mirror to the face of America revealing its sins to the world all the while demanding change."
New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones reflected on Wells-Barnett's pioneering investigative skills, which created a blueprint still used today.
"She had such a strong sense of morality. She was going to tell the truth even if it came to her own detriment," said Hannah-Jones, who called Wells-Barnett a fierce, feisty, dogged reporter who she considers her spiritual godmother. In her reporting, Wells-Barnett collected data and published statistics supporting her findings that black men were being lynched for reasons that were fabricated.
"Can you imagine a black woman at that time, going into territory where a black man or woman had literally been strung up and lynched and asking questions about why this was and what happened?" Hannah-Jones said. "She did this because she understood that the people that committed the murders wrote the reports."
Hannah-Jones noted that, at the time of Wells-Barnett's death in 1931, "she was the most famous black woman in the world."
"And yet it takes until 2019 to get a street named in her honor in the city where she is buried. I think that speaks to the way we have always erased the contributions of black women in this country," Hannah-Jones said. "It is Ida's time."
For many years, Wells-Barnett was overlooked, but recently she has attracted renewed interest.
When she died, The New York Times failed to publish an obituary, but last year the publication addressed the oversight. And after more than a decade of fundraising, the descendants of Wells-Barnett have raised $300,000 toward a monument in her honor. In addition, a political fund aimed at promoting African-American women as candidates for public office now bears Wells-Barnett's name.
Besides her work as a journalist and suffrage activist, Wells-Barnett ran a settlement house on the South Side that offered housing and social services to African-Americans migrating here from the South. She had a hand in creating the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association for Colored Women.
She was also a mentor to W.E.B. DuBois and was close friends with abolitionist and freedom fighter Frederick Douglass. At a time when it was unusual to do so, she hyphenated her last name so that she could maintain her own while adopting her husband's.
"She overcame long odds and high obstacles with hard work and eternal hope," Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. "Listening to the voiceless and the vulnerable -- that is how she wrote history. Now Chicago will tell her story."
"This is more than just a street sign," the mayor added. "It is a sign of her service; it is a sign of her strength; it is also a sign of her selflessness. And all of us who will travel that road will now know something about not only our past, but more importantly how we bend the arc of history to a better day."
For Michelle Duster, the great-granddaughter of Wells-Barnett, the moment was overwhelming. She kept having to remind herself to breathe and take it all in, she said. She hadn't driven down Ida B. Wells Drive by Monday morning, but she had walked it.
"When I was walking over here and I saw the sign, I just had to take a moment and just stare," she said. "We actually did this. ... We actually managed to stick with the idea of having an African-American woman honored in such a prominent way, in such a large city. It's just a really, really big achievement."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Nehad Ahmed fields the question day in and day out: What is that little tiled triangle carved into the sidewalk outside the smoke shop he manages in Greenwich Village?
The answer: It was once considered the smallest piece of private property in Manhattan.
The triangle is roughly 25 by 27 inches -- smaller than a yield sign on a highway, or about 0.0000797113 of an acre. Not quite eight hundred-thousandths.
Mr. Ahmed said the triangle is one of those things that tour guides mention, along with what has long been known as the narrowest house in the Village, a nine-and-a-half-foot-wide structure at 75½ Bedford Street that has been home to famous residents, including Cary Grant, John Barrymore and the poet and playwright Edna St. Vincent Millay.
The triangle outside Mr. Ahmed's smoke shop is completely covered by a plaque. People walk right over it. They stomp on it. They hopscotch around it. Or they do not notice it as they trudge toward the corner of Seventh Avenue South and Christopher Street -- itself a triangle, Olympic-size by comparison and bracketed by sidewalks and two subway staircases less than 30 feet apart.
New York has many lots that were too narrow to build on or, like the triangle, were left over after construction was finished. But Andrew Berman, the executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, had a lot to say about the little triangle.
"Literally and figuratively, it's emblematic of the Village," Mr. Berman said. "It goes against the grain -- it's about a resistance to having the order imposed that is commonplace in the rest of the city -- and it's about the little guy taking on City Hall."
He could have said the Village went against the grid. Its patchwork of streets was laid out when the city pushed northward on a rectangular plan. That was fine until the city decided to connect the subway to Pennsylvania Station after it opened in 1910 -- and extended the subway line farther south.
Until then, the city's one subway line had run down the West Side to 42nd Street, where it turned east and went to Grand Central Terminal. Then it headed south, with stations all the way to City Hall.
For the extension below Penn Station, the city planned a long, straight avenue -- Seventh Avenue South -- atop the newly dug subway. The project forced massive demolition of buildings that were in the way. The New York Times said an 11-block stretch was to be "ruthlessly cut through, destroying many curious old residences and businesses." More than 250 buildings faced demolition, most by condemnation by the city, amid some concerns that the project would "cut the heart out of old Greenwich Village."
One of the condemned buildings was an apartment house known as the Voorhis, owned by the estate of David M. Hess, a Philadelphia entrepreneur and real estate investor who died in 1907.
Mr. Berman of the historical society said that Mr. Hess's heirs put up a fight to save the Voorhis. They went to court. They lost.
And then a surveyor made a mistake. Somehow, after the distances and angles were calculated and recorded on the tax roll, the Voorhis lot did not disappear completely, as the city expected it to. The tiny triangle survived.
"Some versions of the story say it was overlooked by the city," Mr. Berman said. "Others say the Hess estate refused to give up the property from the beginning. From most of the writing I've seen about it, it seems that it was a mistake on the city's part that the city tried to correct" by asking the Hesses simply to donate the triangle.
Apparently still angry about the razing of the Voorhis, they refused, he said.
So the triangle stayed. And the city moved on.
"My assumption is, the city decided it wasn't worth it or didn't think there was a case for eminent domain here," Mr. Berman said.
Some accounts suggest that no one realized the triangle existed until well after the subway had been finished, and Seventh Avenue South paved over. The Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger ran an article about the little lot in 1922. It said the city had demanded payment of property taxes in 1921 and that Frank Hess, the son of David M. Hess, said he had not been aware of the existence of "any such 'lot."'
"He went to New York," The Evening Public Ledger reported, "and saw it -- a piece scarcely large enough for the erection of a slot machine."
The building that the smoke shop occupies had been built by then. It was a cigar store, and Frank Hess arranged for the owners to lease the triangle. The deal called for it to be marked so "the city might know it had not been dedicated to public purposes," The Evening Public Ledger explained. "Had the piece been allowed to remain unmarked and unfenced, the city might have claimed it."
So the plaque was laid, saying the triangle belonged to the Hess estate. The last six words mattered the most, at least to the Hesses: "Never been dedicated for public purposes."
The Hess estate finally sold the triangle to the cigar store's owners in the 1930s, for $100, about $1,781 in today's dollars. At the time, the Hesses had been charging the store rent of "a couple of hundred dollars a year," according to The New York Herald Tribune. The triangle has been a part of the cigar store's lot ever since.
For all the times that the Hess triangle was in the newspapers (and, more recently, online), it did not get the spotlight the way a slightly larger but still small slice of the city did.
That sliver belonged to Brian G. Hughes, a "famous joker," as the headline on his obituary described him when he died in 1924. He had also been the president of the Dollar Savings Bank in the Bronx and the owner of a company that made paper boxes.
He said he would give the city the little piece of land he owned for use as a park.
He arranged for a ceremony to hand over the deed. He hired a band to entertain the crowd that showed up -- all without saying exactly where the property was or how large it was. Meaning, how small.
"He solemnly turned over the deed to a two-by-four bit of property to a popeyed city official," according to Ross Duff Whytock, who wrote about New York for a number of newspapers, including The Hartford Courant. He did not say where the plot was.
"No attempt has been made, so far as I can discover, to carry out Mr. Hughes's injunctions that it be set out with trees, shrubs, flower beds, a bandstand and benches," Mr. Whytock wrote. "In Manhattan it would hardly serve as a breathing space for a subway sardine."

Report: Amazon reconsidering its New York headquarters amid local opposition

Texto completo: ALBANY – The promise of 25,000 jobs as part of a new Amazon headquarters in Queens could be in jeopardy because of concerns over local opposition.
Amazon is reconsidering its decision last year to announce a massive new headquarters in Long Island City in Queens amid growing pushback from local leaders and residents, The Washington Post reported Friday, citing unnamed sources.
New York won the national bidding war along with Virginia last year for the highly coveted project. New York is offering $3 billion in incentives.
But political leaders, including Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have railed against the public subsidies and concerns about whether that section of Queens could handle the influx of people, as well as what it would do to existing residents.
Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, has yet to lease or purchase office space for the New York City project, the paper reported.
And the report noted that Virginia, unlike New York, hasn't raised opposition to its planned Amazon headquarters and could end with more of the jobs as a result.
In a statement, Amazon didn't address the report, saying only that it looks forward to working with the community on the project.
"We're focused on engaging with our new neighbors — small business owners, educators, and community leaders," the Seattle-based company said.
"Whether it's building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be."
Opponents galvanize Among the hurdles in New York is a little-known state board — the Public Authorities Control Board — that will have some say in the public subsidies promised for the project.
The state Senate recently appointed Sen. Mike Gianaris, D-Queens, to the board. Gianaris is one the most vocal opponents of the project, and the board's votes have to be unanimous for funding to be approved.
Opponents galvanized around the potential of Amazon reconsidering Long Island City for its second headquarters.
Unions have ripped the deal, in part because Amazon has refused to unionize the incoming workforce and because the subsidies would go to one of the world's most valuable companies led by the world's richest man.
"If the Amazon deal falls apart, they will have nobody to blame but themselves," Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
"A major problem is the way the deal was put together shrouded in secrecy and ignoring what New Yorkers want and need."
Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter: "Can everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world's biggest corporations? Yes, they can."
Amazon's memorandum of understanding with the state and New York City gives the company an easy out.
The company can terminate the deal at any point with 60 days' written notice, according to the document.
The New York Times reported later Friday, citing two unnamed sources, that the Washington Post article had gone too far and that Amazon had no plans to drop the New York deal.
If New York City doesn't want Amazon, Broome County would gladly welcome the company, said its County Executive Jason Garnar.
"Many of us in upstate New York can't believe that New York City would actually say no to 25 thousand jobs, but Broome County will gladly take a company that will provide 25 thousand new jobs and $5 billion of investment in a New York minute," Garnar said in a statement.
Cuomo rips Senate Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have hailed winning the competition last November, saying the project will be a boon for the New York City area.
On Friday, Cuomo, a Democrat, tore into the Democrat-led state Senate for potentially scuttling the deal, and he urged New Yorkers to voice their displeasure with the Senate's opposition.
"For the State Senate to oppose Amazon was governmental malpractice," Cuomo said during a speech on Long Island.
"And if they stop Amazon from coming to New York, they're going to have the people of New York State to explain it to. It is irresponsible to allow political opposition to overcome sound government policy."
Eric Phillips, a spokesman for de Blasio, said, "The mayor fully expects Amazon to deliver on its promise to New Yorkers."
Senate Democrats pushed back against Cuomo's criticism, which also included the governor accusing the conference of supporting a higher tax on wealthy earners, something conference spokesman Mike Murphy said is untrue.
Democrats took control of the Senate in the November elections after Republicans controlled the chamber for much of the previous century.
"It is unfortunate that the governor is trying to divide the Democratic Party at this crucial and historic time," Murphy said in a statement.
"The Senate Democratic Majority Conference and our partners in the Assembly finally returned New York as the progressive beacon to the rest of the country."
'Greatest economic transaction' Cuomo earlier this week called the Amazon deal "probably the greatest economic transaction in 50 years in this state."
"It was a national competition; it went on for years. States and cities all across the country were competing for it," Cuomo said Tuesday on WAMC, a public radio station in Albany.
"We don't get a business to come with 25,000 jobs anymore. I spend hours and days trying to get 100 jobs, 200 jobs."
Cuomo said if New York didn't offer the incentives, Amazon would have went somewhere else, including nearby Newark, New Jersey, which offered an even larger package.
Cuomo said the state's $3 billion will translate into a $30 billion investment by Amazon.
Both numbers, however, are from an economic-impact report based on the company bringing 40,000 jobs to the city, not the 25,000 minimum the company has agreed to.
The report also didn't take into account any potential negative impacts of the deal.
"I don't see how they do that math, because we're not giving him $3 billion," Cuomo said of critics.
"He's giving us $30 (billion). But take political math. We shouldn't give it to him, then they will leave and they have said that if they are not wanted they will leave. They had hundreds of cities competing here for them.
"This is the wrong issue for the Senate to play politics."

Florence and the Machine at AmericanAirlines Arena June 9

Texto completo: Effervescent rockers Florence and the Machine will bring the final date of their spring High As Hope Tour to AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami on June 9.
Tickets will go on sale to the general public at 11 a.m. Friday, Feb. 8, via Ticketmaster.com, with a handful of presales available to Citi cardholders starting at 10 a.m. Feb. 5 until 10 p.m. Feb. 7.
The group's AmericanAirlines Arena opener will be Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats, one of four supporting acts joining the British band on their 17-date tour, which kicks off May 10 in Arizona.
Florence and the Machine are still on a tear after a lengthy fall tour supporting their acclaimed fourth album "High As Hope," an intimate pop opus more painfully intimate and confessional than her previous three albums. At 32, frontwoman Florence Welch specializes in wringing arena-shaking joy from painful reflections, and that's no different here. Found on "High As Hope" are confident anthems about teenage eating disorders ("Hunger"), depression and loneliness ("Haunted House") and being inspired by punk singer Patti Smith ("Patricia").
"I never thought I would talk about it," Welch told the New York Times last June, referring to her eating disorder. "I quite like the idea of putting really big, unanswerable spiritual questions in pop songs. "We can be together in this moment, and celebrate the not-knowing, and perhaps feel closer to each other. We can jump up and down. If you just dance about it, you will feel better."

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint.
Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward,"De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

Texto completo: TOKYO -- As befits a director whose movies chart the untidiness of Japanese family life, the office of Hirokazu Kore-eda is cluttered with piles of papers, books, photographs, videocassettes and CDs. But it's the dozens of Frankenstein dolls perched around the room that really capture his emotional point of view.
"I love Frankenstein," Mr. Kore-eda said, reverently. "He is just so melancholy."
Mr. Kore-eda, 56, whose latest work, "Shoplifters," has received an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film and has been a box office hit in Japan, specializes in stories about people who endure almost unbearable sadness.
In "Shoplifters," which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, a group of outcasts who live together as a family rescue a little girl from abusive parents and induct her into their clan of petty thievery. For a while, their ragtag clan seems more authentically connected than some families that share DNA. But -- spoiler alert -- ethical doubts late in the movie lead to a devastating rupture.
Mr. Kore-eda says his films represent an implicit criticism of modern Japan. They tackle themes of isolation and social invisibility, as well as the numbing of souls that can come with professional success.
"Nobody Knows," one of Mr. Kore-eda's best-known films internationally before "Shoplifters," is the story of four young children abandoned by their mother in their small Tokyo apartment. In "Like Father, Like Son," which won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 2013, two sets of parents learn that their 6-year-old sons were switched at birth in the hospital, leading to agonizing decisions that expose class divisions between the families and leave them psychologically battered.
"I don't portray people or make movies where viewers can easily find hope," said Mr. Kore-eda, during an interview in his studio in the Shibuya neighborhood of Tokyo. "Some people want to see characters who grow and become stronger over the course of a film. But I don't want to make such a movie."
"It's such a lie," he added. "And I don't want to tell a lie."
Mr. Kore-eda's vision is starkly at odds with that of Japan's leaders. With the economy enjoying modest expansion after decades of stagnation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a speech at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos last month, pronounced a "long-awaited positive feedback cycle" and trumpeted Japan as having a "hope-driven economy."
Such rosy rhetoric belies the demographic challenges that Japan faces, with a declining and rapidly aging population and mounting labor shortages. It also overlooks the insecurity that many Japanese feel working in contract or part-time jobs with scant chance of advancement. A little over one in six people live in poverty. And those who hold full-time jobs are often forced to toil for such long hours that some of them are dying from overwork.
Against this backdrop, Mr. Kore-eda has diagnosed a society where local ties have weakened and nationalism is on the rise, particularly under Mr. Abe's right-leaning government.
So when, after he won the Palme d'Or, the country's education minister invited Mr. Kore-eda for a congratulatory meeting, the director demurred.
"I didn't get the point of why they were trying to congratulate me," Mr. Kore-eda said. "I don't think it's right for the government and moviemakers to get too close. So I wanted to keep a distance from the government."
"Shoplifters" was made in part with government funding, and some critics on social media have bashed the director as anti-Japan or hypocritical. "You took the money and then say that you want to keep a distance" from the government, wrote one blogger. "What a convenient excuse you make." On Twitter, Tsuneyasu Takeda, a conservative commentator, accused Mr. Kore-eda of being a "shoplifting director."
Mr. Kore-eda told an interviewer from Mainichi Shimbun, a Japanese daily, that he was grateful for the public money but viewed it as a subsidy from taxpayers rather than a grant from any particular administration.
"If you think of culture as something that transcends the state," he said, "then you understand that cultural grants don't always coincide with the interests of the state."
The son of a soldier who served in the Japanese Kwantung Army during World War II in the puppet state of Manchukuo in China, Mr. Kore-eda grew up attuned to the vagaries of class within his own family. His father, who was a Soviet prisoner of war in Siberia, hopped from job to job, an anomaly in the postwar era of lifetime employment.
Mr. Kore-eda remembered visiting his father at work at a chemical factory on the outskirts of Tokyo, anticipating that he would observe him dressed in a lab coat mixing compounds in test tubes. Instead, Mr. Kore-eda found his father on the factory floor, wearing a jumpsuit covered in oil stains.
"I could tell he was not well treated or respected in the company," said Mr. Kore-eda, who is now married with an elementary school-age daughter. "It was really shocking, and after coming home I could not really tell him how I felt about him. I felt pity for him."
His mother, who had grown up in a wealthy family, ended up supporting her children when her husband could not find or keep a job. She worked at a recycling factory and a cake-making plant. Mr. Kore-eda said his two older sisters had warned him not to talk about their mother's work history, out of embarrassment.
She nourished a love of movies in her son, watching Western films starring her favorites, Vivien Leigh and Joan Fontaine, on television with him after school.
But it was Mr. Kore-eda's father who ultimately supported his decision to pursue a career as an artist. His mother urged him to find more stable employment.
At Waseda University in Tokyo, Mr. Kore-eda started out intending to become a novelist. But he watched a lot of Japanese television dramas and considered switching to screenwriting. He often cut class to go to the cinema to watch movies by Italian greats like Rossellini, Fellini and Visconti.
"It's a bit cringy to say," he said, a trace of a smile emerging from his salt-and-pepper stubble.
After graduation, he started out making documentaries, but switched to fictional, feature-length films in 1995 with "Maborosi," the story of a woman recovering from the suicide of her husband. Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, described it as "a pictorial tone poem of astonishing visual intensity and emotional depth."
The seed of "Shoplifters," Mr. Kore-eda said, came from a news article about an entire family put on trial for shoplifting in Osaka, Japan's third-largest city. And after making "Like Father, Like Son," he wanted to further explore the theme of family beyond blood bonds.
In Japan, he said, "people still put a big emphasis on blood ties and family bonds," a fixation that he sees as sometimes unhealthy.
Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist at Chuo University who has written about Mr. Kore-eda's films, said that "Shoplifters" was a rebuke of the traditional view of the Japanese family, where only blood relations can be trusted.
"There are many families whose members don't communicate or interact well," Mr. Yamada said. "But the mock family members in the movie care for each other more than some real families."
In their own way, Mr. Kore-eda's movies offer slivers of optimism as well as moments of impish humor. But does he still have hope for his country?
He paused for several beats.
"I have not thrown away hope," he said.

Virginia Lt. Gov. Fairfax acknowledges 2004 consensual encounter with accuser, denies sexual assault

Texto completo: Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax acknowledges that he had a consensual encounter with a colleague in a Boston hotel during the 2004 Democratic national convention but flatly denies her charges of sexual assault.
"I wish her no harm or humiliation, nor do I seek to denigrate her or diminish her voice," Fairfax said Wednesday in his second response to the burgeoning allegations. "But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true. "
The allegations by Vanessa Tyson, now a professor at Scripps College in Claremont, California, surfaced in the wake of a blackface scandal involving Gov. Ralph Northam that potentially could lead to Fairfax becoming governor of Virginia.
Tyson said she decided to go public with her charges because of the prospects that Fairfax seemed likely to become the state's chief executive.
"I felt a jarring sense of both outrage and despair," Tyson said in a statement Wednesday in which she spoke of her charges.
In the statement released by her lawyer, Tyson said she met Fairfax in 2004 when both were working at the Democratic party convention and realized they had a mutual friend.
At one point, she said, Fairfax invited her back to his hotel to retrieve some papers.
"What began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault," Tyson said. "Mr. Fairfax put his hand behind my neck and forcefully pushed my head towards his crotch. "
Tyson alleged that Fairfax then forced her to perform oral sex.
"I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual," she said, adding that she consciously avoided him for the rest of the convention and never spoke to him again.
Fairfax, in his statement, called Tyson's account "surprising and hurtful" but said, "I have never done anything like what she suggests. "
Fairfax first acknowledged having had an intimate encounter with Tyson on Monday, but told reporters it had been “100 percent consensual. ”
“We hit it off, she was very interested in me, and so eventually, at one point, we ended up going to my hotel room,” Fairfax recalled of the 2004 incident, according to The New York Times.
The 39-year-old Democrat said any review of the circumstances surrounding the alleged incident would support his account.
"At no time did she express to me any discomfort or concern about our interactions, neither during that encounter nor during the months following it, when she stayed in touch with me, nor the past fifteen years," Fairffax said. "She in no way indicated that anything that had happened between us made her uncomfortable. "
While a wide array of Democrats, both in Virginia and nationally, as well as Republicans have called on Northam to step down over the blackface incident, fewer voices have come out against Fairfax.
Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization of Women, however, has urged him to step down, as has Rep. Jennifer Wexton, a freshman Virginia Democrat who previously served in the state senate.
Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, of California, said Thursday she finds Tyson's charges "credible" and called for a thorough investigation of the allegations.
In a bizarre twist to recent sexual allegations that have rocked national politics, Tyson is represented by the law firm that backed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she accused then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in high school.
Fairfax, in turn, has retained the law firm that represented Kavanaugh during those contentious hearings, CNN reports.
Although Tyson agreed to go public with her allegations this week, she had tried to raise her concerns last year in the run up to the elections that put Fairfax in the lieutenant governor's chair.
She said she spoke in 2017 to a personal friend at The Washington Post, and to colleagues, about the allegations but that the newspaper decided not to run her story.
The Post, which spoke to people who knew Fairfax from college, law school and through political circles, found no similar complaints of sexual misconduct against him, the newspaper reported this week. Without that, or the ability to corroborate Tyson's account — in part because she had not told anyone what happened — the Post did not run a story.
The experience, she said, left her feeling "powerless, frustrated, and completely drained," and that she had declined to press the issue until Fairfax appeared likely to ascend to the governorship in Virginia.
"I have no political motive," she said. " I am a proud Democrat. My only motive in speaking now is to refute Mr. Fairfax’s falsehoods and aspersions of my character, and to provide what I believe is important information for Virginians to have as they make critical decisions that involve Mr. Fairfax.

Texto completo: After Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, President George W. Bush declared a national emergency to do something Republicans had long wanted to do anyway: He suspended prevailing wage laws on federal contracts to rebuild the region.
Labor unions protested. Democrats signed on to a bill to rewrite the law. Even dozens of moderate Republicans asked Bush to reconsider.
But then a single congressman used a parliamentary maneuver – never attempted before or since – to challenge the underpinnings of the national emergency itself.
Bush backed down without even a vote.

The largely forgotten story of Bush's capitulation explains why Republicans have advised President Donald Trump against bypassing Congress and invoking a national emergency to build a wall along the Mexican border.
In addition to raising legal questions – such a move would inevitably be challenged in court – a declaration would invite Congress to exercise its long-dormant power to revoke national emergencies.
And all it would take is one member of Congress to force the issue.
In 2005, that member was Rep. George Miller, a California lawmaker who was the top Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee.
Calling Bush's decision "callous and misguided," Miller's first move was to try to amend the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. That law sets the prevailing wage for federal contracts, but allows the president to grant waivers in times of national emergency.
But Democrats were in the minority, and while some Republicans were grumbling about Bush's move, they were unwilling to sign on to Miller's legislation – meaning it would never get to the House floor.
So Miller changed tack. He dug up the National Emergencies Act of 1975, one in a series of post-Watergate reforms. It allowed Congress to terminate a presidential emergency by simple majority vote.
Republican leadership couldn't block the vote: Under the law, they had 15 business days to bring it out of committee and to the floor.
Miller introduced his resolution on Oct. 20, and a vote was scheduled for Nov. 8.
On Oct 26, the Bush administration announced it would terminate the emergency effective Nov. 7.
Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said the administration had reexamined the issue and discovered that it wouldn't save as much money as initially forecast. (Chao remains a power in Washington: She's now Trump's transportation secretary, and her husband is Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. )
Miller declared victory.
"Let me be clear," he told the New York Times. "The president is backing down today only because he had no other choice. "
Mark Zuckerman, who was the Democratic staff director of the House Education and Labor at the time, says all it took was the threat of a vote.
"It can be revealing when you make people vote on something," he says.
"We thought it was an unacceptable and inappropriate use of emergency powers, but we also wanted to check to see if there was really Republican support for something like this. I think it’s part of the genius of the procedure is that it tests sentiment on Capitol Hill for your unilateral idea. "
The original intent of the 1975 law was to allow Congress a block a presidential emergency by simple majority vote. But in 1982, the U. S. Supreme Court struck down the legislative veto. So now, any joint resolution by Congress to terminate an emergency can be vetoed by the president.
And McConnell said Trump could do exactly that.
"The president could win anyway by vetoing the bill and then trying to get enough votes to sustain it, so may ultimately be able to prevail on the national emergency alternative," McConnell told Fox News on Tuesday.
Still, some GOP senators are already expressing discomfort over such a vote, and have asked Trump this week – both publicly and privately – not to put them in that position.
"It's not my preferred choice," said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.
"I hope he doesn't do it," said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
"It might be a – you know – a tough vote to win here in the Senate," said Sen. John Thune, R-S. D.
One concern is the precedent such a declaration would set.
"I think most Republicans will tell you that we really would like to find a way to avoid that type of a discussion if at all possible because this goes beyond just this president," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S. D. , told CNN on Wednesday. "This goes on to future presidents and what they might decide to declare an emergency for. "
Special report: America's perpetual state of emergency, from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama
That was exactly what Congress expected when it voted overwhelmingly to pass the National Emergencies Act.
The law called for every emergency to be reviewed – and possibly voted on – every six months. But in 44 years, presidents have declared at least 60 national emergencies without Congress taking a single vote.
Thirty-one of those emergencies remain in place today.

The use of emergency powers became so routine that the Obama administration said in 2015 that they were mere formalities – despite their boilerplate language that they're in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security. " And presidents seem to have ignored requirements that they update Congress on the costs of those emergencies.
More: The Obama White House claimed that national emergencies were just formalities
Liza Goitein, director of the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has advocated reforms to presidential emergency powers.
"I think Congress has woken up to the idea that the process for declaring emergencies is too permissive," she says.
"This isn’t going to look good if the Republican Senate is voting to curtail the president's power. It’s going to split Republicans and force Republicans to take a vote they don’t want to take – and it may not go Trump's way. "
Trump did not mention the national emergency in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but says he's still considering it. A national emergency could allow him to transfer unspent military construction funds toward a wall.
"I don't like to take things off the table," Trump told CBS in a pre-Super Bowl interview. "It's that alternative. It's national emergency, it's other things and, you know, there have been plenty national emergencies called. "

Investor slams chiefs of Facebook in new book

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Roger McNamee wants to give Mark Zuckerberg a chance to redeem himself.
Another chance, that is.
Perched on a low stage in a rehabbed industrial space in Lower Manhattan, McNamee - an early Facebook adviser - slams the way Facebook's founder does business.
"Move fast, break things, apologize, repeat," says McNamee, who looks boyish despite his black pinstriped suit and his 62 years.
"They've been doing it from Day One. It's culturally built in."
And that's all a part of what he describes as the Silicon Valley way: "Ship the product and let the consumers find the bugs."
Of course, with Facebook, the "bugs" have been more like democracy-destroying monsters. McNamee - a legendary venture capitalist who still owns shares of Facebook - knows this full well.
But the pointed criticism of Zuckerberg and his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, in his new book, "Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe," is meant to make things better, he says.
And, as McNamee told a crowd of 240 people on Wednesday evening at Betaworks, a tech incubator, he resists the idea that Zuckerberg and Sandberg should resign their posts over the company's well-known disasters: its privacy breaches, its enabling of liars and haters, its help to Russian hackers. (As a New York Times review of "Zucked" put it: "Considering the high likelihood that Russian activity on Facebook may have tipped the 2016 election to Donald Trump, the damage is already of generational measure.")
Yet McNamee still has a modicum of faith in the Facebook founder and Sandberg, his top aide, drawing a laugh with his tepid vote of confidence: "I believe they are one good night's sleep from getting this."
And besides, he says, until Facebook's rapacious business model changes - probably only as a result of much-needed government regulation - no new leadership would make a difference anyway.
He writes: "The business model depends on advertising, which in turn depends on manipulating the attention of users so they see more ads. One of the best ways to manipulate attention is to appeal to outrage and fear, emotions that increase engagement."
Facebook has responded consistently to McNamee's takedown by pointing out that he hasn't had a meaningful role there for many years and that the company has made strides on protecting consumers and otherwise cleaning up its act.
At the Betaworks book talk, CNN tech correspondent Laurie Segall - her documentary, "Facebook at 15: It's Complicated," airs Sunday night - read the canned response aloud.
McNamee and Zuckerberg were once fairly close, maybe even mentor and mentee.
At the very least, McNamee takes credit, though perhaps it should be seen as blame, for advising Zuckerberg not to sell the company early on.
Later, when he tried to warn them about what was happening in 2016 - his fear that bad actors were exploiting Facebook's audience - he says they turned a deaf ear. And they haven't spoken since.
In recent days, McNamee has been energetically flogging his book - on "Fox & Friends" one moment, on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" another. On Thursday night, he was due to speak at Politics & Prose Bookstore on Connecticut Avenue in Washington.
And in his travels, he preaches an anti-Facebook gospel: the value of getting out to meet people face to face, especially people you might not agree with.
"My whole thing is 'let's get together,' " says the man who describes himself as a former "tech nerd" who carried seven mobile devices. (McNamee, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area, is also the frontman of a roots-rock band, Moonalice, whose best-known song is "It's 4:20 Somewhere," and his venture capital firm, Elevation, boasted U2's lead singer, Bono, as an early business partner.)
But despite the harsh criticism of Zuckerberg and Sandberg, and his disgust with the worst crimes of social media platforms, there are limits to his disdain.
McNamee not only still owns Facebook shares - the company posted record profits last month - he also still counts himself among the behemoth's more than 2 billion users.
The idea of his coming off Facebook altogether? Unthinkable, really.
After all, McNamee acknowledges with a shrug and a smile, "I've got a book to promote."

Jeff Bezos accuses National Enquirer parent of 'extortion and blackmail' attempt

Texto completo: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is firing back at National Enquirer owner American Media Inc. (AMI) over what he is calling an "extortion and blackmail" attempt by the tabloid.
In a lengthy post on Medium Thursday, Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post and is also the world's richest person, details alleged correspondence between the lawyer for his lead investigator, Martin Singer, and Dylan Howard, the chief content officer for AMI.
In emails posted by Bezos, Howard says the Enquirer would post a series of images it has of Bezos and former Los Angeles news anchor Lauren Sanchez, the Amazon founder's love interest.
In a separate email, AMI attorney Jon Fine said that the company would not publish the unreleased emails and text if Bezos released a statement "affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces. " The emails also demanded Bezos and his investigator agree that they would stop "referring to such a possibility. "
The images, according to Howard's email posted by Bezos, include a variety of private pictures of both Bezos and Sanchez such as a "below the belt selfie" of Bezos and a picture of Sanchez "smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene. "
Bezos shared the Medium post from his official Twitter account. Amazon has separately confirmed the authenticity of the post, but declined to comment further. AMI and Howard did not immediately respond to USA TODAY requests for comment.
The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and Sanchez's relationship, including romantic text messages the two had sent one another. The Enquirer posted the text after Bezos' announced last month that he and his wife, MacKenzie, would be getting a divorce after 25 years of marriage.
The leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to have Gavin de Becker from his security team investigate how the Enquirer got its hands on the messages.
Bezos claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic” over an investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
"A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer," Bezos writes. "They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation. "
Bezos also notes in his blog how Pecker "recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called “Catch and Kill” process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign," linking to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. "
In his note to Bezos attorney Singer, Fine requested that the Bezos statement would be made through a "mutually-agreeable news outlet. "
In his Medium posting, Bezos said his ownership of The Washington Post has been a "complexifier" for him before continuing to say that he does not regret his 2013 purchase of the company for $250 million.
"My stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when I’m 90 and reviewing my life, if I’m lucky enough to live that long," he writes, "regardless of any complexities it creates for me. "
Given his position, Bezos says he felt he was in a place to stand up the Enquirer. "I was made an offer I couldn’t refuse. Or at least that’s what the top people at the National Enquirer thought," he writes.
"I’m glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing. Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I’ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten. "
The Pecker-Trump relationship
Pecker is a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Trump has been a critic of Bezos, Amazon and The Post frequently targeting all three on Twitter.
Trump tweeted about Bezos' personal life following the National Enquirer's reveal that Bezos was seeing Sanchez, calling the Amazon founder "Jeff Bozo" and writing that he was "so sorry to hear the news" about Bezos being "taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. "
Federal prosecutors in New York have accused AMI of participating in a scheme to help him win the presidency by paying women to keep silent about alleged extramarital affairs before the election. More than a year before the election, Pecker met with Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and an unnamed member of his campaign to discuss ways the company could help bottle up damaging stories about Trump.
In August 2016, AMI struck a deal with former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal to pay her $150,000 for the rights to publish her claim to have carried on an affair with Trump a decade earlier. Prosecutors said the company’s “principal purpose in entering into the agreement was to suppress (her) story so as to prevent it from influencing the election. ”
Cohen pleaded guilty last year to orchestrating that payment and another, to the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, both of which violated federal campaign finance laws. Soon after, prosecutors promised not to bring charges against AMI in exchange for its cooperation with their investigation, one of two criminal probes now encircling the president. U. S. District Judge William Pauley said in a decision on Thursday that the probe of the campaign finance violations is ongoing.

Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, and the politics of playing nice

Texto completo: When I wrote about US Senator Elizabeth Warren's purported “likability" challenge recently, a reader insisted that voters' reactions to her weren't sexist but pragmatic.
A different woman would do better in a general election against President Trump, he contended. Consider the appeal of US Senator Amy Klobuchar, who not only hails from the Midwest that Hillary Clinton neglected but is also widely regarded as “Minnesota Nice?"
He had a point. You can dislike a particular politician without being sexist, of course, and many Democrats want a candidate who's less confrontational, more unifying, to counter Trump in 2020.
So I asked this reader to do a little experiment: Write back after Klobuchar is an actual presidential candidate. Let's see if she falls into the same likability trap and whether it changes your view.
Well, Klobuchar hasn't even announced yet, and the Huffington Post has already posted a story detailing the ways in which Klobuchar has allegedly been not-nice.
Reports of her alleged meanness were served up anonymously by former aides, but the story offered these data points: Klobuchar had the highest staff turnover of any senator for 16 years running. At least three people bowed out of consideration to manage her anticipated presidential campaign because of her reputation of mistreating aides, the story said.
All of that is fair game — and may offer some satisfaction to the men out there who think their careers could now be threatened by workplace interactions they didn't even recognize as inappropriate. These days, we call out bad behavior — even if it feeds into the familiar trope of the mean girl. Klobuchar supporters “question whether former co-workers who thought she was abusive were falling for sexist stereotypes about female leaders with high standards," the Huffington Post story acknowledged.
But while we're at it, let's consider our own standards for presidential candidates — and whether they differ by gender.
Is “nice" what America wants from a president? Do we view our leader as a benevolent boss?
We didn't in 2016, noted Chloe Safier, a gender consultant who works with organizations that advance women's equality.
“If niceness was a qualifying trait for a candidate, we would not have a sitting president who built a public persona on a reality show wherein he brought people into a boardroom and yelled that they're fired," Safier wrote in an e-mail.
Candidates need to be appealing, she noted, but 'niceness' is a gendered term. And, noted Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, warmth is often associated with a lack of competence. Conversely, a woman who is concise, direct, and aggressive is often regarded as cold, insufficiently feminine, and not likable enough.
“The problem is, no matter which end you move to as a woman, you can be discredited on gender grounds," said Jamieson, the author of “Beyond the Double Bind: Women and Leadership."
The worst-case scenario: “If you want to undercut someone, what you basically say is the nice is a façade," Jamieson said. “The person is actually ruthless."
Klobuchar was previously prized for her nonthreatening relatability. When former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell talked her up to the Washington Post, he put it this way: “She's tough as anyone, and yet she appears to be the girl next door."
“The person every father would like their son to meet and maybe marry," he added.
That probably is not the standard he applies to every presidential contender.
Now, consider Beto O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat who lost a much-hyped campaign to unseat US Senator Ted Cruz in November. A New York Times profile this week detailing his time in New York cast him as a mediocre punk rocker and sometimes-nanny who was adrift in his early 20s, unambitious, depressed, and, often, stoned — but always, unfailingly, likable.
A female candidate would be ridiculed for such a narrative, some women protested on social media Thursday. But O'Rourke, a liberal darling, is being drafted to run for president.
Jamieson agreed she could not imagine a female politician in the same situation.
However, she added: “It's not terribly plausible for a male candidate either."

Texto completo: As if an entire Saturday of free author events and book signings isn't enough, Savannah Book Festival along with Live Oak Public Libraries will also host a day for children's and young author book lovers the next day from 1-4 p.m. Feb. 17 in Reynolds Square.
The Savannah Book Festival Children's Tent will include author presentations, book signings, celebrity story times, music and art, which is all free.
This year's scheduled featured authors are Kwame Alexander, Michael Patrick O'Neill, Javaka Steptoe, and Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes.
Alexander is a poet, educator and New York Times bestselling author of 28 books. He is best known for his popular titles including "Swing," "Solo" and "Rebound," as well as his 2015 Newberry Medal award-winning book, "The Crossover," which was also selected as an Honor book for the Coretta Scott King Award.
O'Neill, an award-winning photographer and author from São Paulo, Brazil, specializes in marine wildlife and environmental issues. He has captivated readers through his photographs spotlighting the tales of diverse aquatic animals, their habitats and impact the environment has on their futures. O'Neill's nonfiction marine-life books are designed to encourage school children to read, write and become involved in science and conservation.
Steptoe won a 2017 Caldecott Award, NAACP Image Award nomination and a Coretta Scott King award for his book, "Radiant Child." He is also well-known for his award-winning book "Jimi: Sounds Like a Rainbow." Steptoe contributed an image to "Thirteen Ways of Looking at Black Boy," which was published by the Savannah-based Penny Candy Books.
Kensky and Downes, both best-selling authors, along with their service dog, Rescue, will also make an appearance at the Children's Tent. Kensky and Downes were seriously injured and each lost legs during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. Their story of survival was brought to the big screen in the movie "Patriots Day."
As co-authors, the New York Times bestselling couple released their first book, "Rescue and Jessica: A Life-Changing Friendship," in April 2018, just ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing. In the book, readers will follow a young girl named Jessica as she adjusts to life with prosthetics, wheelchairs and crutches with the help of her new service dog, Rescue.
Kensky says that while the material that inspired the book may seem pretty heavy for a children's book, the response from children at their book readings has been phenomenal.
And Downes explains the book is really for all ages. "Our story has appeal across age spectrums. We were worried the subject would be off-putting for children, but they dive in. Jess and I try to approach the subject with honesty... and the kids thrive off that. They know if you are telling the whole story... then their compassion shines."
"We are both surprised by how many kids - of all ages - attend our book readings and how many engage in the conversation and ask questions," Kensky adds. "The smaller kids tend to ask questions about Rescue... while teens tend to ask questions about our prosthetics or mobility issues... and adults seem to be seeking answers... or peace of mind.
"We tend to get emotional responses from adults... especially to the ending of the book. ...We have been able to see the book affect everyone in different ways."
The pair say they are excited to make the trip to Savannah for the book festival. Kensky's parents actually retired in Savannah, so they'll be there to see their "grandpup" Rescue when they come to town.
And Jessica adds that she lets Patrick do the reading at these events because he does the best Rescue voice.
"Then we tailor the talk to the audience," she adds. "We'll bring out Rescue and introduce him.
"Sometimes the discussion gets deeper and we'll do a Q&A session. We strive to be honest with our conversation. We also usually bring different prosthetics to show the audience."
When asked what the process of writing the book was like, Patrick explains, "We aren't writers.
"We wrote the book over a course of four years while we were healing. ... It was a therapeutic escape for us. We didn't know at the time if it would every see the light of day. And now, being in a tent with kids and making them laugh is incredibly humbling.
"Kids are so fascinated by Rescue, and when they learn more about the struggles we face, they want to know what they can do to make the world more welcoming for people with disabilities. They want justice and fairness for all."
The couple says they hope to continue that conversation in other books.

Texto completo: Things are looking up for the New York Times — one of the nation's leading news organizations that President Trump loves to deride as the "failing New York Times."

The New York Times Company announced it generated more than $709 million in digital revenue in 2018, suggesting that it could meet its goal of $800 million in digital sales by the end of 2020.

Twenty-seven percent more people paid for Times digital content last year compared to 2017.

More than 3.3 million people paid for digital products from the Times, including its news, crossword, and food apps, and there were 4.3 million subscriptions for the outlet's digital and print versions.

“[Our target is] to grow our subscription business to more than 10 million subscriptions by 2025,” the Times chief executive Mark Thompson said in a statement on the company’s fourth-quarter financial results, setting a new goal for the outlet.

The strong numbers come after several other outlets recently announced a wave of cutbacks and layoffs in efforts to become profitable. BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, and Vice Media were among them.

Vice Media announced it was laying off 10 percent of its staff, BuzzFeed laid off 15 percent, and the Huffington Post nixed both its health and opinion sections and all employees who worked for those parts of the site.

Gannett, which owns USA Today, also laid off at least several dozen of its employees at different newspapers across the country.

Texto completo: A new talent competition show brings together RuPaul, Faith Hill and Drew Barrymore as judges. And "Hillary," a series about one of the first climbers to reach Mount Everest's summit, is available to stream.
What's on TV
THE WORLD'S BEST 8 p.m. on CBS. This outrageous new reality show, hosted by the comedian James Corden, holds its second night of auditions. International musicians, dancers, martial artists, gymnasts, singers and more will compete for the judges RuPaul, Faith Hill and Drew Barrymore, as well as a panel of 50 experts from 38 countries, for the chance to win $1 million and the title of "The World's Best." The competition show, which debuted after the Super Bowl, is the latest spin on flashy TV talent shows like "The Masked Singer" and "The Voice."
FORGED IN FIRE 9 p.m. on History. In a very different kind of reality-show competition, the sixth season of "Forged in Fire" brings together bladesmiths who show off their weapon-making skills for the chance to win $10,000. The show is hosted by Wil Willis, a former Army Ranger; J. Neilson, a veteran knife maker; Doug Marcaida, the hand-to-hand-combat specialist; and David Baker, a swordsmith well versed in ancient weaponry. As its name suggests, the series features a lot of fire, so it's best not to try to replicate the action at home: In 2017, one aspiring bladesmith caused a massive blaze.
What's Streaming
HILLARY on Amazon Prime, Google Play, PBS, Vudu and YouTube. Edmund Hillary may be best known as the adventurer who made history in 1953 when he and the mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first people to scale Mount Everest's summit. But this six-part series delves into Hillary's life, from his days growing up in South Auckland, New Zealand, to the plane crash that killed his wife and daughter. Andrew Munro stars in the title role, and Dean O'Gorman plays his lifelong climbing companion, George Lowe.
MINDING THE GAP (2018) on Hulu. This skateboarding documentary, the director Bing Liu's feature debut, is about so much more than skateboarding. It uses the sport, a shared passion among friends like Zack Mulligan and Keire Johnson in Rockford, Ill., to examine a bigger cycle of neglect and abuse that permeated their childhoods, and begins to seep into their lives as adults. In his review in The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote: "The title can be taken to refer to the chasm between hope and reality, or to the fissures that separate people from one another and from their own best selves. But it also suggests the possibility of self-awareness and the healing power of reflection." The film was nominated for an Oscar for best documentary feature, and President Obama included it in his list of works he loved in 2018.

Texto completo: An Alabama police officer will not be criminally charged for killing a young black man whom he had mistaken for the gunman in a shopping-mall shooting Thanksgiving night, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday. The decision is likely to extend the debate over a tragedy at the intersection of gun rights and concerns over racial biases in policing.
The shooting death of Emantic F. Bradford Jr., 21, at the Riverchase Galleria mall in Hoover, Ala., prompted protests and raised questions about whether police officers are too quick to assume that a nonwhite person who is armed is a wrongdoer.
In a 24-page report, Attorney General Steve Marshall concluded that the Hoover police officer -- identified only as Officer 1 -- who shot Mr. Bradford had "reasonably exercised" his duties.
"Officer 1's actions were reasonable under the circumstances and were consistent with his training and nationally accepted standards for 'active shooter' scenarios," the report stated.
The police officer shot Mr. Bradford, who went by E.J., a few seconds after gunshots rang out at the mall on Nov. 22, sending shoppers racing for safety and leaving an 18-year-old man, Brian Wilson, injured by two bullets.
The officer, who was on duty at the mall, said in a statement that he had turned toward the sound of the gunfire with his weapon drawn, and saw an injured man clutching his stomach near a railing, with another man helping him. He said he also saw "an armed suspect" who was "quickly moving towards the two males standing near the railing."
"The suspect was advancing on the two males and had a black handgun in his right hand," the officer said. "I fired my duty weapon at the armed suspect to stop him." That man was Mr. Bradford.
The officer said he thought Mr. Bradford was going to kill the two men, and the report said the officer had "mistakenly believed" Mr. Bradford had fired the initial shots.
The officer said he was unable to issue verbal commands before firing, "due to the quickness of the event and the immediate threat Bradford posed" to the two men he was approaching.
The police later arrested another man -- Erron Martez Dequan Brown, 20 -- and charged him with attempted murder in connection with the shooting of Mr. Wilson, the injured man by the railing.
The attorney general's report said there was no evidence that Mr. Bradford's handgun was fired at the mall.
The report said the F.B.I. had found no evidence to prompt an investigation into whether Mr. Bradford's civil rights had been violated, a basis for federal prosecutions in cases that are otherwise under state jurisdiction. An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter Tuesday.
The decision not to bring charges did little to quell the suspicions and anger of Mr. Bradford's relatives and supporters. "I'm outraged," his mother, April Pipkins, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. "In no way was justice served."
Some surveillance video images of the events at the mall were released on Tuesday. But Benjamin L. Crump, a lawyer for the family, said he believed there was additional footage that had not been released, and he demanded that the public be allowed to see it. In a prepared statement, he said that Mr. Bradford's "only 'crime' was being black."
Ashlyn McMillan, a witness to the mall shootings, told The New York Times that she considered Mr. Bradford a hero, saying that he had directed frantic shoppers to safety and had warned her to get down and seek cover inside a store.
A man named Roosevelt Poole filled in some of the night's narrative blanks at a recent preliminary hearing in the case. According to the Alabama news website AL.com, Mr. Poole said that he and another man were with Mr. Brown, the suspected gunman, in front of the J.C. Penney store in the mall when Mr. Bradford, Mr. Wilson and about eight other people showed up.
Soon, Mr. Poole said, Mr. Wilson was slapping and punching Mr. Brown, the website reported. Mr. Brown's lawyers say that he shot Mr. Wilson in self-defense.
The attorney general's report said that video footage showed Mr. Brown and his friends running into the J.C. Penney store after the shots were fired. For his part, Mr. Bradford initially ran away from the store entrance after the shots, the report said, but then drew his weapon and chambered a round.
"Bradford then charges back toward J.C. Penney, gun drawn," the report states.
Mr. Crump said in a telephone interview that he believed Mr. Bradford was in no way intending to engage in a shootout.
The attorney general's report concludes that the officer's initial mistaken belief that Mr. Bradford had shot Mr. Wilson did not render the officer's actions "unreasonable."
"First, a reasonable person could have assumed that the only person with a gun who was running toward the victim of a shooting that occurred just three seconds earlier fired the shots," it said.
The report also asserted that Mr. Bradford "still posed an immediate deadly threat to persons in the area. Video evidence suggests that Bradford, who was carrying a firearm, was running toward the initial shooter, Erron Brown, who was also carrying a firearm. Multiple shoppers were nearby, including a mother and child directly in between the two armed men."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Limiting ‘obscene’ in class draws ire

Texto completo: Lawmakers heard hours of passionate testimony on Monday about a proposal that would require teachers to get permission from parents or students before utilizing potentially "obscene material" in classrooms.
AUGUSTA — Lawmakers heard hours of passionate testimony on Monday about obscenity, literature and censorship as they considered a proposal to require teachers to notify parents or students before utilizing sexually explicit materials in classrooms.
Bill sponsor Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata, R-New Gloucester, and her supporters said parents as well as students should have the opportunity to opt out of reading or viewing “obscene materials.” Yet opponents pointed out that parents can already formally challenge a book’s usage with the local school board and compared Arata’s bill to previous attempts to ban works now considered classics of literature.
“Who is going to decide what is obscene? Who is going to police this law in all of our schools across this state?” asked Cathy Potter, a librarian in Falmouth’s public schools. “And are you prepared to prosecute librarians and teachers for putting books in the hands of our students ... because this would make it a crime.”
As an example of “the pornographic nature of materials being assigned to students in Maine,” Arata distributed excerpts from “Kafka on the Shore,” which was assigned to her son in the 12th grade. The 2002 book by Japanese author Haruki Murakami has won critical acclaim — including landing on The New York Times’ Top 10 list for 2005 — but contains some explicit descriptions of sexual activity as well as rape.
As originally written, Arata’s bill proposed that public schools be removed from the list of institutions — such as libraries or museums — that are exempt from the law prohibiting the dissemination of obscene materials to minors. That proposal garnered vociferous push back from educators and others who recalled the moral policing that once led schools or entire states to ban such literary classics as “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “Of Mice and Men” and “Catcher in the Rye.”
In response, Arata amended her bill to, instead, require teachers to provide written notice that the book or other materials contained obscene content or depictions of sexual assault. Both the students and their parents/legal guardians would need to provide written consent prior to receiving the materials.
“This common-sense bipartisan bill will give minors and parents the respect and dignity of choosing what is appropriate for them and their family so that they do not have to feel embarrassed, harassed or traumatized,” Arata said. She said the bill “will help make sure that all Maine schools are safe and nurturing environments for our children.”
Supporters included the Christian Civic League of Maine, pastors and parents, as well as several survivors of sexual assault warned that graphic depictions or descriptions could further traumatize children who are victims themselves. Others objected to teachers’ selection of certain movies with objectionable material in their classroom curriculum.
Jennifer White of Gray said her then 11-year-old daughter was confused after watching a film in class that included both sexual content and depictions of a man committing suicide with a gun.
“Showing a movie with that type of graphic content and sexually explicit material can cause harm to a child that is not mature enough to handle it, and fifth grade is not mature enough to handle that,” White said. “This is one example of how L.D. 94 can better provide transparency to both children and families.”
But teachers, librarians and associations representing Maine’s school boards and superintendents urged lawmakers to reject a bill that would make it a criminal offense for teachers to teach literary texts that some perceive as obscene.
“The problem is that what is obscene to one person or group may be judged to have artistic or social merit to another,” said Claudette Brassil, a retired English teacher representing the Maine Council for English Language Arts. “Criminalization of literary choices is a detriment to academic freedom. As in the past, contemporary community standards continue to evolve and are influenced by many forces.”
Brassil, a Brunswick resident who taught at Mt. Ararat High School in Topsham, testified that literary works can sometimes provide a platform for students to talk about violence or sexual situations with adults. She also said that she believes children are becoming more willing to speak up to trusted individuals — including teachers — when they are victims of abuse.
Opponents also said the bill was unnecessary because school boards in Maine already have a process through which members of the public can challenge the suitability of educational materials and request a formal review. In fact, Arata used that process to successfully challenge the use of “Kafka on the Shore” in her children’s schools.
“This is a decision that I believe is best handled locally with your school board — people who you elect and most likely represent, as a group, the norms in your community,” said Victoria Wallack, representing both the Maine School Boards Association and the Maine Schools Superintendents Association. “That is where I would go first. I wouldn’t be here at the Legislature trying to change educational policy that is rightfully adopted ... by the school board.”
The Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee is expected to hold a work session on L.D. 94 next Monday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee confirmed Monday that it had received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York as part of an investigation into the group’s fundraising activities.
“While we are still reviewing the subpoena, it is our intention to cooperate with the inquiry,” the committee said in a statement.
Owen Blicksilver, a committee spokesman, declined to elaborate on the scope of the government’s request.
The investigation is being led by prosecutors from the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, and represents potentially more legal trouble for the Trump administration as it continues to confront the ongoing inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and other spinoff investigations.
State of the Union: Politically wounded from the shutdown, Trump faces a tough time with his agenda

A copy of the new subpoena, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, indicated that prosecutors had sought all documents linked to the committee’s fundraising activities, including donors and those who provided services to the organization.
The committee had raised more than $100 million to host events related to Trump’s inauguration.
The inaugural committee inquiry is separate from the investigation led by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller whose inquiry is focused on possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Nevertheless, prosecutors leading the inaugural probe also are believed to be reviewing whether the committee received contributions from foreign sources, according to previous accounts by the New York Times.
Federal law prohibits such donations.
The investigation rose, at least in part, out of information seized while investigating Michael Cohen, the president's former attorney and fixer.
In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for a host of crimes, including making secret hush payments before the 2016 election to women who accused Trump of having affairs and lying to Congress.
During April raids on Cohen's home, office, and hotel room, federal investigators discovered a taped conversation between Cohen and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who worked with the inaugural committee, the Wall Street Journal reported last year.
The contents of the recording are unclear but Wolkoff, according to the Journal, voiced concerns over how some of the inaugural funds were being spent.
Disclosure of the new subpoena also comes at a politically fraught time for Trump, who is scheduled to deliver the State of the Union address Tuesday and as a possible second government shutdown looms over a clash with Democrat lawmakers about funding for the president’s long-promised border wall.

THE QUIET POWER OF RACHEL ROBINSON SHE WAS INTEGRAL TO JACKIE BREAKING BASEBALL'S COLOR LINE

Texto completo: Jackie Robinson, who would have turned 100 on Jan. 31, is often remembered for his courage, athleticism, tenacity and sacrifice. By confronting Jim Crow -both as a baseball player and as a civil rights activist -he changed America.
"Back in the days when integration wasn't fashionable," Martin Luther King Jr. said of Robinson, "he underwent . the loneliness which comes with being a pilgrim walking through the lonesome byways toward the high road of freedom. He was a sit-inner before sit-ins, a freedom rider before freedom rides."
I've written three books about Robinson, in addition to dozens of columns and articles. I used to wonder how Robinson persevered in the face of so much hate and ugliness. He was certainly as tough a competitor as any athlete who ever lived, and he had an unwavering religious faith.
But I eventually realized that he couldn't have achieved what he did without his wife, Rachel, whose spirit was as formidable as his own.
Sure, he had his mother, Mallie; his minister, Karl Downs; Brooklyn Dodgers' president, Branch Rickey, who signed him; and sportswriter Wendell Smith, who served as his ghostwriter and confidante.
Rachel, however, was the only constant.
"She was not simply the dutiful wife," Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Roger Wilkins said about Rachel. "She had to live through the death threats, endure the vile screams of the fans and watch her husband get knocked down by pitch after pitch. . She was beautiful and wise and replenished his strength and courage."
Rachel Isum met Jackie Robinson at UCLA when she was a freshman and he was a senior. Jackie was a four-letter athlete and "a big man on campus," as she described him.
They married five years later on Feb. 10, 1946, a few months after Brooklyn Dodgers President Branch Rickey signed Jackie to play for the organization's top minor league team, the Montreal Royals.
Two-and-a-half weeks after the wedding, the Robinsons left the relative comfort of Los Angeles to go to spring training in Florida. Robinson would have to confront both baseball's color line and the Jim Crow laws of the South, where blacks who challenged segregation risked jail, injury or death.
Rachel knew she and Jackie could not react to every racial epithet hurled their way. But she wasn't averse to quiet forms of resistance. When their plane stopped in New Orleans on their flight to Florida, Rachel saw something she had never seen before: separate restrooms for "white women" and "colored women." She defiantly walked into restroom marked "white women."
During that first spring training, segregation laws prohibited the Robinsons from staying in the same oceanfront hotel in Daytona Beach with his white teammates. Nor could they eat in white restaurants. They stayed with a black family and ate their meals in a black restaurant.
Robinson, feeling the weight of representing millions of black Americans, struggled during the beginning of spring training. He had trouble hitting, and he hurt his throwing arm so badly that he could barely lift it.
Rachel calmed Jackie every night in their small room, massaging his sore arm as he raged against the indignities he faced on and off the field. She also learned she was pregnant while they were in Daytona Beach, but decided not to tell him.
"There was such an incredible amount of pressure, it might have driven two people apart," she told Sports Illustrated in 2013. "But it had the opposite effect on us, it pushed us together."
At some point, as Rachel later told Robinson biographer Arnold Rampersad, Jackie began to refer to himself not as "I" but as "we." Jackie and Rachel were united as civil rights activists; they knew, as Rachel put it, "that the issue wasn't simply baseball but life and death, freedom and bondage, for a lot of people."
As the spring progressed, Jackie's arm improved and so did his confidence. He played the 1946 season with the Montreal Royals before being promoted to the Dodgers the next spring. He established himself as one of the best players in the National League. But the racist epithets continued to rain down on him from the stands and the dugouts of opposing teams.
Rachel was determined to make their home a refuge from that malevolence, whether the Robinsons were living in Montreal, New York City, or later, in Stamford, Conn.
"We had a pledge to each other that we were going to try to keep the house a haven," she said. "Someplace safe. Someplace we didn't have to replay the mess outside."
Rachel raised their three children while her husband was playing baseball and crusading for civil rights. After earning her master's degree, she worked as a nurse-therapist and researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. She then taught nursing at Yale University while she served as director of the Connecticut mental health center.
After Jackie died, Rachel created the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which has provided scholarships for 1,400 college students.
When the Jackie Robinson biopic "42" was released in 2013, Brian Helgeland, the film's writer and director, asked Rachel what she thought of the film.
"I loved how much we kissed," Mr. Helgeland recalled Rachel telling him. "And then she got emotional," he continued. "It was the only thing she ever said to me about the finished film. And it hit me: Her take-away from the whole thing was that she got to see her husband one more time."

Texto completo: Republicans question report critical of Trump hotel lease
WASHINGTON - Leading congressional Republicans demanded Monday that an internal government watchdog who had issued a critical report related to President Donald Trump's luxury hotel in Washington produce reams of documents to support her conclusions.
The letter, to the General Services Administration's inspector general, was a clear signal that Trump's allies in Congress plan to aggressively defend his business dealings as his company comes under increasing scrutiny by House Democrats and others.
The letter was penned by Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee.
It centered on a Jan. 16 report by inspector general Carol Ochoa criticizing the government's decision-making that allowed Trump to keep the lease on the Trump International Hotel downtown, which is in a building owned by the GSA.
The report charged that the GSA "ignored" concerns that Trump's lease of a government-owned building might violate the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bars presidents from taking payments from foreign governments or individual U.S. states.
Johnson and Jordan suggested that Ochoa's office may have overstepped its bounds by studying whether the government had ignored the Constitution in reviewing Trump's lease.
They also questioned why Ochoa's office failed to cite Justice Department arguments on the matter.

Iraqi president hits back at Trump over U.S. army presence
BAGHDAD - Iraq's president hit back at Donald Trump on Monday for saying U.S. troops should stay in Iraq to keep an eye on neighboring Iran, saying the U.S. leader did not ask for Iraq's permission to do so.
"We find these comments strange," said Barham Salih, speaking at a forum in Baghdad.
Trump has angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by arguing he would keep U.S. troops in Iraq and use it as a base to strike Islamic State group targets inside Syria as needed.
In an interview with CBS News' "Face the Nation," he said U.S. troops in Iraq were also needed to monitor Iran.
"He didn't ask Iraq about this," Salih said Monday. He said the Iraqi Constitution forbids the use of Iraq as a base to threaten the interests or security of neighboring countries.

Afghan government frozen out of peace talks with the Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan - Taliban representatives and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's political rivals plan to discuss the future of Afghanistan on Tuesday in Moscow, a move seen by some as a further blow to the authority of the country's current administration.
The two-day meeting brings key Afghan power brokers together with the insurgents to discuss ending the war that began in late 2001.
The Moscow talks follow a series of direct negotiations between Taliban members and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad amid a renewed push by President Donald Trump to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.
Ghani's government was excluded from all of those meetings because of the Taliban's objection to an administration it regards as a U.S. puppet.

U.S. calls for repatriation of foreign fighters held in Syria
BEIRUT - The United States on Monday called on other nations to repatriate and prosecute their citizens who traveled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State group and who are now being held by Washington's partners in the region.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces say they have detained more than 900 foreign fighters during their U.S.-backed campaign against the Islamic State group in northeastern Syria, where they are currently battling the extremists.
The question of what to do with the detained foreigners has grown increasingly thorny since President Donald Trump's surprise announcement in December that he intends to withdraw all American forces from the country.
Very few countries have expressed readiness to repatriate their citizens.

Prosecutors subpoena Trump inaugural papers
NEW YORK - Federal prosecutors in New York have issued a subpoena seeking documents from Donald Trump's inaugural committee.
A spokeswoman says the committee intends to cooperate with the inquiry and was reviewing it.
The Wall Street Journal reported last year that federal prosecutors are investigating whether inaugural committee donors made contributions in exchange for political favors.
The newspaper said the inquiry also was focused on whether the inauguration misspent money it raised to stage inaugural events.
The New York Times reported recently that federal prosecutors are examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee.

Judge: Victims of shooting at church can sue gun retailer
SAN ANTONIO - A judge has ruled that victims of a mass shooting at a Texas church can move forward with a lawsuit against a sporting goods chain where the gunman bought the weapon and ammunition used in the massacre.
The decision Monday by state District Judge Karen Pozza clears the way for families of the 2017 Sutherland Springs shooting to potentially bring their case against Academy Sport & Outdoors before a jury.
The retailer is where gunman Devin Kelley bought an assault-style rifle used in the church shooting that killed more than two dozen people.
Some families have also separately sued the U.S. Air Force over failing to report Kelley's past crimes to a federal database. Kelley was an Air Force veteran who was discharged in 2014 for bad conduct.

Nomination: President Donald Trump says he's nominating a Washington veteran with lobbying ties to U.S. energy companies to lead the Interior Department.
David Bernhardt, currently Interior's acting head, would replace Ryan Zinke - who resigned in December - if the Senate approves his nomination.

Manfort sentencing: Paul Manafort has a new sentencing date. A federal judge Monday set a March 13 sentencing for the former Trump campaign chairman on two felony charges stemming from witness tampering and crimes related to his Ukrainian work. Manafort faces up to five years in prison on each charge.

'Fake news' claims are untrue, and he knows it

Texto completo: President Trump claims - falsely - that he invented the term "fake news."
He didn't, of course, but he sure has popularized it. By one count, he has uttered the word "fake" more than 400 times since he was elected, usually applied to stories, journalists or news organizations.
"I'm so proud I've been able to convince people how fake it is," he bragged to Lou Dobbs, one of his favorite media toadies, on Fox Business Network last fall, talking about mainstream media reporting. He specifically called out CBS and NBC, and, of course, he has consistently trashed the New York Times.
And yet, just over the past few days, there he was, sitting down nicely with the publisher of the New York Times, practically begging for positive treatment from what he, remarkably, referred to as his newspaper. ("I came from Jamaica, Queens . . . and I became president of the United States. I'm sort of entitled to a great story - just one, from my newspaper.")
And there he was with Margaret Brennan of CBS News's "Face the Nation" on Sunday, granting a long interview during which he once again used the "fake news" slur to describe reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was considering leaving his post to run for retiring Sen. Pat Roberts's seat in Kansas.
Brennan deftly pointed out that Pompeo had indeed talked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about just that political possibility. "Well, he may have spoken to him, but I think he loves being secretary of state," Trump said in a quick walk-back. (He's done this countless times. Remember the stalwart defense of the national security adviser Michael Flynn, followed by his firing once the truth about him was unavoidable?)
It's as simple as this: Trump doesn't believe that the news about him is fake. No matter how many times he says it.
He merely objects to the fact that it doesn't reflect well on him.
The right-leaning Media Research Center found that 92 percent of network news stories about Trump over a four-month period last year were negative. The MRC called this "the most hostile coverage of a president in TV news history."
But negative doesn't mean untrue. It doesn't even mean unfair.
And at his core, Trump knows this.
The "fake news" he complains about is merely accurate coverage that he doesn't like.
Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson drew right-wing plaudits recently when she referred to her former paper's coverage of the president - as well as The Washington Post's - as "unmistakably anti-Trump." (The author of a new book on the press, "Merchants of Truth," Abramson also praised much of the reporting at both papers.)
I disagree with Abramson - and with the Media Research Center. The fact that the Trump coverage comes off as negative doesn't make it "hostile" and doesn't make it "anti-Trump."
Like the Pompeo report that Trump wanted to brand as "fake," it's merely true. And being for the truth doesn't amount to being against the president.
During the period that the MRC looked at network coverage, these were the major Trump-related topics: the special counsel's Russia investigation, immigration, the Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh's nomination, North Korea and relations between the United States and Russia.
One of the stories that got attention during that period was that nearly 500 children, taken from their parents at the southern border as part of Trump's "zero tolerance" policy, remained in U.S. custody.
Should this have been spun as glowingly positive for the president? Was it "hostile" to report on it?
By walking back fake-news claims when he can't avoid the truth, by agreeing to high-profile interviews with news organizations he claims to despise, and by claiming to be "entitled" to positive coverage from them, Trump shows his real colors.
It wasn't always thus. Back in the olden days - around 2014 - the term "fake news" started to be used to describe purposeful lies, in the form of news stories that would ideally go viral on Facebook, that were meant to mislead.
But after his election, Trump took this legitimate danger - real "fake news," if you will - and he weaponized the words. Now the cries of "fake" applied to whatever coverage he didn't like or that didn't serve his political purposes, or his need for praise.
His rhetorical jujitsu, combined with the drumbeat of constant repetition, has done lasting harm to reality-based journalism: It deepens mistrust and undermines the crucial role of the free press.
And because his name-calling is so widely imitated, it has done harm around the globe - and at many a small-town newspaper and TV station in America.
Trump's use of "fake news" as a weapon is one of the most despicable things he has done as president.
Which makes it even worse that he doesn't believe what he's saying.

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Before he started the whole alien spaceship thing last year, the chairman of Harvard University's astronomy department was known for public lectures on modesty. Personal modesty, which Avi Loeb said he learned growing up on a farm. And what Loeb calls "cosmic modesty" - the idea that it's arrogant to assume we are alone in the universe, or even a particularly special species.
You can find a poster for one of these lectures in Loeb's office today, though it's a bit lost among the clutter: photos of Loeb posing under the dome of Harvard's enormous 19th-century telescope; thank-you notes from elementary-school children; a framed interview he gave the New York Times in 2014; his books on the formation of galaxies; his face, again and again - a bespectacled man in his mid-50s with a perpetually satisfied smile.
Loeb stands beside his desk on the first morning of spring courses in a creaseless suit, stapling syllabi for his afternoon class. He points visitors to this and that on the wall. He mentions that four TV crews were in this office on the day in the fall when his spaceship theory went viral, and now five film companies are interested in making a movie about his life.
A neatly handwritten page of equations sits on the desk, on the edge closest to the guest chairs.
"Oh, this is something I did last night," Loeb says. It's a calculation, he explains, supporting his theory that an extraterrestrial spacecraft, or at least a piece of one, may at this moment be flying past the orbit of Jupiter.
Since publishing his controversial paper, Loeb has run a nearly nonstop media circuit, embracing the celebrity that comes from being perhaps the most academically distinguished E.T. enthusiast of his time - the top Harvard astronomer who suspects technology from another solar system just showed up at our door. And this, in turn, has left some of his peers nonplused - grumbling at what they see as a flimsy theory or bewildered as to why Harvard's top astronomer won't shut up about aliens.
What you can't call Loeb is a crank. When astronomers in Hawaii stumbled across the first known interstellar object in late 2017 - a blip of light moving so fast past the sun that it could only have come from another star - Loeb had three decades of Ivy League professorship and hundreds of astronomical publications on his résumé, mostly to do with the nature of black holes and early galaxies and other subjects far from any tabloid shelf.
So when seemingly every astronomer on the planet was trying to figure out how the interstellar object (dubbed 'Oumuamua, Hawaiian for "scout") got to our remote patch of Milky Way, Loeb's extraordinarily confident suggestion that it probably came from another civilization could not be easily dismissed.
"Considering an artificial origin, one possibility is that 'Oumuamua" - pronounced Oh-mooah-mooah - "is a lightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment," Loeb wrote with his colleague Shmuel Bialy in Astrophysical Journal Letters in November - thrilling E.T. enthusiasts and upsetting the fragile orbits of space academia.
"'Oumuamua is not an alien spaceship, and the authors of the paper insult honest scientific inquiry to even suggest it," tweeted Paul M. Sutter, an astrophysicist at Ohio State University, shortly after the paper published.
"A shocking example of sensationalist, ill-motivated science," theoretical astrophysicist Ethan Siegel wrote in Forbes. North Carolina State University astrophycisist Katie Mack suggested Loeb was trolling for publicity. "Sometimes you write a paper about something that you don't believe to be true at all, just for the purpose of putting out there," she told the Verge.
Most scientists besides Loeb assume 'Oumuamua is some sort of rock, be it an asteroid ejected from some star in meltdown hundreds of millions of years ago, or an icy comet wandering the interstellar void. But it's moving too fast for an inert rock,Loeb points out- zooming away from the sun as if something is pushing it from behind. And if it's a comet spewing jets of steam, the limited observations astronomers made of it showed no sign.
Loeb argues that 'Oumuamua's behavior means it can't be, as is commonly imagined, a clump of rock shaped like a long potato, but rather an object that's very long and no more than 1 millimeter thick, perhaps like a kilometer-long obloid pancake - or a ship sail - so light and thin that sunlight is pushing it out of our solar system.
And while he's not saying it's definitely aliens, he is saying he can't think of anything other than aliens that fits the data. And he's saying that all over international news.
"Many people expected once there would be this publicity, I would back down," Loeb says. "If someone shows me evidence to the contrary, I will immediately back down."
In the meantime, he's doubling down, hosting a Reddit AMA on "how the discovery of alien life in space will transform our life," and constantly emailing his "friends and colleagues" with updates on all the reporters who are speaking to him.
In a matter of months, Loeb has become a one-man alternative to the dirge of terrestrial news.
"It changes your perception on reality, just knowing that we're not alone," he says. "We are fighting on borders, on resources. . . . It would make us feel part of planet Earth as a civilization rather than individual countries voting on Brexit."
So now he is famous, styling himself as a truth-teller and risk-taker in an age of overly conservative, quiescent scientists.
"The mainstream approach [is] you can sort of drink your coffee in the morning and expect what you will find later on. It's a stable lifestyle, but for me it resembles more the lifestyle of a business person rather than scientists," he says.
"The worst thing that can happen to me is I would be relieved of my administrative duties, and that would give me even more time to focus on science," Loeb adds. " All the titles I have, I can dial them back. In fact, I can dial myself back to the farm."
Loeb grew up in an Israeli farming village. He would sit in the hills and read philosophy books imagining the broader universe, he says, a fascination that led him into academia and all the way to 'Oumuamua.
"I don't have a class system in my head of academia being the elite," he says, as he leads a reporter into the locked chamber of the Great Refractor - an enormous 19th-century telescope where he sometimes does photo ops. "I see it as a continuation of childhood curiosity - trying to understand what the world is like."
He joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., in the late 1980s ("Where Einstein used to be," he notes) and later took a junior position in Harvard's astronomy department, where "for 20 years no one had been promoted from within . . . They tenured me after three years.")
As he tells it, his life story sounds like a cerebral version of "Forrest Gump" - Loeb always single-mindedly pursuing his science and intersecting with the giants of the field, whom he regularly name-drops. Stephen Hawking had dinner at his house. Steven Spielberg once asked him for movie tips. Russian billionaire Uri Milner once walked into his office and sat on the couch and asked him to help design humanity's first interstellar spaceship - which he is now doing, with a research budget of $100 million and the endorsement of Mark Zuckerberg and the late Hawking.
Loeb mentions casually that when he was 24 years old he got a private audience with the famed physicist Freeman Dyson - and then pauses for effect beneath the 20-foot shaft of the Great Refractor, grinning until he realizes the reporter doesn't know who Freeman Dyson is.
At midday, Loeb leaves the telescope and his office and descends to a bare white classroom to introduce the basics of astrophysics to a dozen new students.
If he's mastered the national news interview by now, his lecture begins a bit stilted. He looks down at the table as he speaks. He asks the freshmen at this most prestigious of universities to go around the table and list their hobbies.
Ten minutes later, Loeb goes off script.
"Did anyone hear the name 'Oumuamua?" he asks. "What did it mean?"
Almost everyone nods, and freshman Matt Jacobsen, who came to Harvard from an Iowa farm town, volunteers quietly: "There was speculation that it was from another civilization."
"Who made that speculation?" Loeb asks, smiling.
There's an awkward silence in the room, and then Jacobsen cries, "Was it you? Oh, my gosh!" and the professor smiles wider.

Texto completo: John O. Marsh Jr., a conservative Virginia Democrat who interrupted his congressional career in the 1960s to serve his National Guard duty in Vietnam foxholes, became one of President Gerald Ford's closest advisers and spent eight years as Army secretary under President Ronald Reagan, died Feb. 4 at an assisted-living center in Raphine, Va. He was 92.
Mr. Marsh had complications from a recent stroke, said his son John O. "Rob" Marsh III.
Although not widely known outside the policymaking corridors of Washington - the New York Times called him one of the longest-serving but "least known" senior officials in the Defense Department - Mr. Marsh was a powerful backstage player at the White House and the Pentagon during the 1970s and 1980s.
He retained the demeanor of the folksy, soft-spoken country lawyer he had been during his early career. But he was also shrewd and subtle - a "careful, almost soulful political operative," as Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward once described him.
After a hardscrabble upbringing in the Shenandoah Valley, Mr. Marsh became a commissioned Army officer by 19, trained as a paratrooper, served 25 years in the Virginia National Guard and devoted much of his adult life to military affairs.
In late 1966, during his second term in Congress, he volunteered for a month-long stint in the Vietnam highlands, never revealing to other soldiers that he held national office. (He served under the command of then-Lt. Col. Alexander M. Haig Jr., the future four-star Army general who became chief of staff under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ford and secretary of state under Reagan.)
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Marsh was a solid supporter of the Vietnam War and co-sponsored the bill that created the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission in 1966. Increasingly ill at ease in a party that was tilting ever leftward, he declined to seek election to a fifth term in 1970.
"They required candidates for office to sign an oath that they would support the national ticket, which I refused to do," he later told presidential historian Richard Norton Smith. "I was not putting up with that."
In 1973, Nixon named Mr. Marsh assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, essentially the Pentagon's chief lobbyist to Congress. The next year, he became a top assistant to then-Vice President Ford on national security matters. After Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, amid the threat of impeachment for Watergate-related offenses, Mr. Marsh spent three years as a Cabinet-level counselor to President Ford.
He was regarded as one of Ford's most influential aides - the president's "conscience," Smith said. "He was the wise man of the Ford administration," he added, "someone who was steeped in the traditions of the House, someone who enjoyed the confidence of both sides of the aisle, someone seen as not primarily thirsting in ambition. He'd walked away from the House."
Mr. Marsh's designated duty was to act as a liaison with Capitol Hill, but he was in practice an ambassador without portfolio. Among other duties, Ford appointed Mr. Marsh to a commission that examined illegal domestic spying and other abuses by the CIA.
But the crisis that most stood out - and defined the Ford White House - was the question of a full pardon for Nixon over his role in Watergate. The matter arose during Nixon's final week in office, when Ford's advisers learned that Haig had reached out to Ford about the possibility of a pardon.
Ford said he had made no promises, but in Mr. Marsh's view, the mere perception of a backroom deal with Haig threatened Ford's reputation and legacy. The vice president's top counselors, chief among them Mr. Marsh, told him to call Haig immediately and make clear there would be no arrangement of a pardon.
"I wanted the president to see the linkage" with the Haig visit, Mr. Marsh told author Barry Werth for the book "31 Days," about the pardon and its aftermath. "I know that Jerry Ford has a naive streak, and it is there because he trusts people and doesn't see motives that people have."
Mr. Marsh and other aides went out for drinks that night, imagining they had forestalled a crisis. But a month into his presidency, on Sept. 8, Ford issued a full pardon, explaining to his staff - and later to the public - that he wanted to lance the boil of Watergate and move forward on legislative priorities.
Instead, Ford faced a revolt among Democrats as well as many in his own party. His press secretary, Jerald F. terHorst, a respected journalist, resigned, saying he could not "credibly defend" the pardon.
The pardon, along with deepening economic "stagflation," contributed to Ford's defeat in 1976 by former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter (D).
Mr. Marsh, who gradually came to call himself a Republican, spent four years in private practice until Reagan's presidential victory in 1980 returned the White House to GOP control. Over two terms, Mr. Marsh became the Army's longest-serving civilian administrative leader in modern times.
Amid Reagan's arms buildup, Mr. Marsh played a major backstage role in persuading members of Congress to support deploying Pershing II missiles to Western Europe at a time of strong opposition in the United States and abroad.
Some analysts later said the missiles, which could carry nuclear warheads, helped spur negotiations with the Soviets on a 1987 treaty that banned land-based American and Russian intermediate-range missiles - a landmark in Cold War de-escalation.
Mr. Marsh was credited with increasing the Army's budget substantially and with using his authority to back the budding Special Operations forces (SOF). Many at the Pentagon - and their allies in Congress - supported big-fire weaponry and conventional fighting forces and were suspicious of covert activity by small, elite units.
Withstanding pressure by the service chiefs to defund the units, Mr. Marsh took on the added role of acting assistant secretary of defense for Special Operations to signal his support at a time when the forces had not yet gained a reputation for excellence.
Retired Army Col. Keith Nightingale, who was involved with the initial phases of the U.S. Special Operations program, said the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden
, among other successful operations, "was a direct result of Marsh not allowing the Army to disband several crucial elements of the emerging SOF units."
"Now," he added, "personalities and attitudes have dramatically changed to where SOF is now the darling child of all the services."
John Otho Marsh Jr. was born in Winchester, Va., on Aug. 7, 1926, and grew up in Harrisonburg, Va. During the Depression, his family relied mostly on his mother's salary as a schoolteacher. His father had abandoned medical training after being diagnosed with tuberculosis and went on to run businesses including a gas station and a shoe store.
Mr. Marsh's time in the Army included service with the post-World War II occupation forces in Germany. On the GI Bill, he received a law degree in 1951 from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., then commenced a career in law and local politics.
With the backing of Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr., who controlled a statewide political machine, Mr. Marsh won an open congressional seat in 1962.
His wife of 65 years, the former Glenn Ann Patterson, died in 2015. In addition to his son, a combat surgeon for the Delta Force in Somalia, of Middlebrook, Va., survivors include two other children, Rebecca Whitener of Pulaski, Va., and Scot Marsh of Winchester; and seven grandchildren.
Mr. Marsh retired from the National Guard in 1976 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. His honors included the Defense Department Medal for Distinguished Public Service.
In 2007, The Washington Post exposed decrepit conditions, systemic problems with patient care and leadership failures at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. Soon afterward, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates named Mr. Marsh and Togo West, who had been Army secretary under President Bill Clinton, to co-chair an independent review group to address The Post's findings.
Among the panel's recommendations were shuttering Walter Reed as soon as possible and accelerating its move to the National Naval Medical Center campus in Bethesda, Md.
Mr. Marsh had made patriotism a hallmark of his public service, and one of his principal legacies as Army secretary was reinvigorating a sense of pride in a military still reeling from defeat in Vietnam.
He spearheaded annual morale-building, values-based themes, including the spirit of victory at Yorktown, Va., physical fitness and the year of the noncommissioned officer.
"I didn't become secretary of the Army," he told the Times, "to go around hangdog and half ashamed, apologizing for the United States Army in Vietnam, because it needed no apologies."

World Record Egg: From a challenge to social media to a mental health campaign

Texto completo: The Instagram account @world_record_egg was originally designed as a fun way to challenge and question social media, its creators say. However, the account quickly morphed into an opportunity to focus on mental health positivity and to encourage people to speak up.
Following nearly a month of suspense, the mysterious Instagram account that became famous for a picture of an egg – which came out of left field to break Kylie Jenner's record for likes on a single post – revealed its identity late Sunday night. "Identity" is a loose term, though: The egg serves as part of a mental health awareness campaign.
Egg Gang – a group comprising Chris Godfrey, 29, who works in advertising at The & Partnership in London, and two friends, according to The New York Times – is responsible for the Instagram account. The mysterious original post of a brown egg from Jan. 4 now has over 52 million likes, and the account has 10 million followers. The group "declined to talk about the money it has been offered or the big names it has come into contact with," according to the Times.
Nick Tran, Hulu’s vice president of brand marketing and culture, said that Hulu agreed to partner with Egg Gang because they believed in their mission of spreading mental health awareness and wanted to enable them "to share their message as broadly as possible. ”
"It wasn’t just a stunt – it was really about a vision they had to promote something good in the world,” Tran said.
Tran also said that Hulu did not want this video to be exclusive to Hulu customers, noting that he believed viewers would record the video off their phones and share it with the world.
At the start of the video, the egg – which is slightly cracked, has drawn-on eyes and makes some sounds – introduces itself. Then, it notes, "Recently I've started to crack. The pressure of social media is getting to me. "
The egg then makes a direct plea to viewers, stating, "If you're struggling too, talk to someone. " The final still of the episode directs viewers to mentalhealthamerica. net.
The site belongs to Mental Health America, a nonprofit founded in 1909 that is "dedicated to addressing the needs of those living with mental illness and to promoting the overall mental health of all Americans. " The organization currently has over 200 affiliates in 41 states.
Erin Wallace, chief communications officer at Mental Health America, said that the Egg Gang reached out to them regarding using their website at the end of the video. However, Mental Health America was not part of the production of the video.
The reaction to the video "has been great, and we are thrilled that World Record Egg used its big reveal to shine a light on mental health," Wallace said. "It’s important for people to speak up about their mental health, and to seek help if they need it. "

Texto completo: It’s over. After 12 years of daily contact, I am finished with Facebook. It's not easy. We had a long, meaningful connection — my avatar had more than 1,200 virtual friends from every stage of my life.
Thousands of tiny takes and status updates from two-dimensional acquaintances had nearly replaced physical, personal contact. And those digital updates, links and images carried surprising emotional value. For instance, though my mother died four years ago at 90, I’ve still wished her happy birthday each year on her dormant Facebook page.
I was an enthusiastic early adapter. I joined in early 2006, when there were fewer than 12 million members. So intriguing was the prospect of a world wide Rolodex, I forged an email address with an . edu suffix in order to qualify.
More: I deleted my Twitter account. It's a breeding ground for thoughtlessness and contempt.
Though well into my 50’s when Mark Zuckerberg launched his online club, I considered myself internet literate. I wrote for an online magazine, comfortably searched on Google, banked online and bought bargains on eBay. I used email daily and instant messaged my children.
Online becomes real life
But Facebook, guiding my idea of friendship from analog affection to digital distraction, became my entry into social media. Before joining, friendship had been an analog connection, exclusively three-dimensional, and suddenly it was accessible through another, limitless portal.
Social scientist Robin Dunbar holds that humans have a social connection capacity of roughly 150 individuals — (although I doubt marketing algorithms drive his research). But, in the beginning of Facebook, there were literally millions of additional friends to choose from.
In real life, I know when I’ve been unfriended and feel sadness with such a loss. But, recognizing the difference between human and avatar, I’d hardly notice falling off with a fair-weather Facebook friend.
My timeline was stacked with my Generation X, millennial colleagues and some childhood friends of my grown-up children. In the days before everyone had a Twitter game, The New York Times Magazine had an item about the most entertaining status updates on Facebook. A week or two later, one of these cyber celebrities requested my friendship. Flattered, I readily accepted, years before I learned the meaning of "FOMO. "
I searched for a few familiar names from high school, but my new virtual companions skewed much younger. Around 2008 a person whose name I didn’t recognize reached across the decades to befriend me. His profile showed he attended my high school class of 1967 and my memory conjured a shy boy among the coat locker-lined hallways, just outside of my field of vision.
With the mental image of him came a sharp, unpleasant recollection of my own adolescent judging. A little shaken that my history had so abruptly caught up with me, I messaged my former classmate, apologizing for the callow, dismissive teenager I had been. He replied graciously, feigning ignorance of my prehistoric microaggression. Unfortunately, though my social skills had improved since my teenage years, my digital interface abilities were still subpar. I slighted him again by accidentally deleting his friend request.
Meantime, I cyber-gifted virtual cupcakes, posted videos, and quoted song lyrics to my new pixilated pals. I wrote often on Slate, Aol and the Washington Post about Facebook’s college-age founder’s controversies and public presence. I was solidly team Zuckerberg when Aaron Sorkin’s film "The Social Network" was released in 2010. Although I was skeptical when my new friend Mark claimed his site would soon act as a “personalized” and customized news source, I was fully committed to sharing images of my 3-year old grandson.
I dreamed Facebook and I would grow old together, anticipating applications for home-bound seniors that could help us dote on our families.
Facebook: The anti-social network
By then radio stations, super markets and members of Congress had all signed up. Persons were depersonalized and “timelines” indeed became “news feeds” with unsubstantiated opinions sponsored by unknown pulpits dotting my virtual front page.
As the club got bigger, my younger friends drifted away to other social media. Suddenly, my boomer cohort came aboard. My 50-year class reunion in 2017 was organized via a closed group on the site.
Sadly, by then, the 2016 election had negatively colored my Facebook feed. Even before I learned that ersatz engagement may have impacted its results, the division and name calling among previously pleasant posters had gotten tiresome. I found myself mollifying my conservative contacts who were insulted by the indignation of my more liberal friends.
By last March, when Cambridge Analytica was suspected to have surreptitiously affected election results using tens of millions of Facebook members’ personal data, my ardor had dimmed more definitively. The massive security breach in September was proof the site was sloppy with my secrets. The final blow to our crumbling relationship came with December’s revelations that my once beloved was cheating on me with other commercial sites. My friendship facilitator had betrayed me. I was weary of being commodified.
As 2018 came to its inauspicious end, I posted a "Dear Facebook, it’s over," status update citing our lost faith. “The trust is gone in our relationship. ”
Our separation is cordial. I have not deleted the software from my laptop despite helpful instructions online on how to archive and sever. It seems too soon to be burning portals.
I changed my status to “closed” and have gone silent, with a sentimental sigh for lost love. I like to think my contacts are continuing the conversation without me.

Texto completo: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Trump would not commit in an interview aired Sunday to making public the results of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's ties to his campaign, adding that it was time to "get rid" of the inquiry.
In the interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Mr. Trump reiterated his belief that the attorney general would determine whether the public would see the results of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But he would not say whether he would be comfortable with the results being made public.
"I don't know," the president said. "It depends. I have no idea what it's going to say."
The law does not require the Justice Department to release a report, and Mr. Mueller has been silent on the issue. Last month, Trump advisers were pleased that William P. Barr, Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, opened the door to the possibility that the special counsel's report could be shielded from the public during a Senate confirmation hearing.
Mr. Trump's wide-ranging interview with Margaret Brennan, the show's host, was conducted days after the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, said the investigation was nearing its end, and amid stagnant negotiations with Democrats over Mr. Trump's demand for a border wall. Mr. Trump indicated at various points in the interview that he would use the power of his office to solve that matter and others facing his presidency.
Among those matters, the president appeared to suggest, are national security and the military. He called the use of military force against Venezuela "an option." And he indicated that he would like to keep troops in Iraq -- a striking departure from his push to withdraw from Afghanistan and Syria -- to "keep an eye" on Iran.
"It's perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up," Mr. Trump said. "We're going to keep watching and we're going to keep seeing and if there's trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we're going to know it before they do."
On the border wall fight, the president reiterated his belief that "we have now set the table" to take action after a short-term deal to fund part of the government -- a deal struck to end the longest government shutdown in history -- expires on Feb. 15. In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested that he had successfully made the case to Americans that the problem at the border was enough to constitute declaring a national emergency, and that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was doing a "disservice" to the country -- both points he again made on Sunday.
"People that didn't have any idea," Mr. Trump said. "They didn't have a clue as to what was happening. They now know exactly what's happening."
Mr. Trump is expected to make immigration a cornerstone of his State of the Union speech, which is scheduled for Tuesday. In the interview with CBS, Mr. Trump once again accused Democrats, in particular Ms. Pelosi, of ignoring urgent problems at the border, which included human trafficking and what Mr. Trump called an "invasion" of human traffickers into the country.
Though Mr. Trump seems intent on ignoring congressional negotiations, lawmakers insisted on Sunday that they were still trying. Senator Richard C. Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the committee working to reach a deal, admitted that it was too early to say whether the negotiations could be successful.
"I think that the president is dead set on keeping his campaign promise," Mr. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said on CNN's "State of the Union." He acknowledged that Mr. Trump probably had some legal merits for declaring a national emergency over the border wall, but he pleaded for the committee to be allowed to do its work.
"If people leave us alone," Mr. Shelby added, "we'll get this done by Wednesday night."
He said that the committee had invited experts with knowledge of the southwestern border to testify this week on exactly what is needed for border security. Mr. Shelby expressed optimism that hearing from those experts "could move us off of" the semantic debate over a wall or fencing.
"It's a question of how do we get off the politics and on to the substance," he said.
Other members of the bipartisan committee -- Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, and Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota -- doubled down on their respective party's positions on "Fox News Sunday." Mr. Cuellar, who represents parts of the border, dismissed the president's reasoning for the wall as built on "a false premise."
In the CBS interview, Mr. Trump fought back against criticism of his wall and other policies. He responded to warnings that his administration was risking a resurgence of terrorist groups by promising the rapid withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan by saying that he "ran against 17 Republicans" and won.
"I'll leave intelligence there," Mr. Trump said, "and if I see nests forming, I'll do something about it."
Last week, Mr. Trump showed similar defiance in suggesting that his intelligence chiefs "go back to school" for issuing a threat assessment saying that North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear program and that Iran is not, for now, taking steps necessary to make a bomb.
Mr. Trump said that he would ultimately rely on his own counsel if he disagreed with intelligence assessments.
The president also indicated that the power of his affectionate letter writing with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, might persuade Mr. Kim to drop his nuclear plans. Mr. Trump has at least six letters from Mr. Kim that he enjoys sharing with people who visit him in the Oval Office.
"We have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can't even believe it," Mr. Trump said. "Now that doesn't mean we're going to make a deal. But certainly I think we have a very good chance of making a deal."
Other leaders did not receive such praise. Mr. Trump said that he had declined a meeting with Nicolás Maduro, the embattled president of Venezuela, days after the Trump administration said it recognized Juan Guaidó, the 35-year-old opposition figure, as the country's rightful leader.
"I decided at the time, 'no,' because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela when you look at that country," Mr. Trump said.
With his cabinet in flux, Mr. Trump dismissed as "fake news" the reports that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had asked Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state and his most visible emissary in negotiations with North Korea, to consider leaving to run for a Senate seat in Kansas.
Mr. Pompeo confirmed that discussion over a week ago. The secretary of state said that he had appreciated the call, but that he had a "very full plate."
The CBS interview was broadcast during the president's first visit in months to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, where he spent Saturday golfing with Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. On Sunday, the president hit the golf course again amid planning for his annual Super Bowl party.
The president told CBS that he loved to watch football, but that he would not encourage his youngest son, Barron, 12, to participate in such a dangerous sport.

Texto completo: C.Y. Lee, a Chinese-born author whose best-selling 1957 novel "The Flower Drum Song"
explored conflict among first- and second-generation immigrants in San Francisco's Chinatown, provided the source material for two Broadway productions 43 years apart and sparked a cultural debate about Asian stereotypes, died Nov. 8 at his daughter's home in Los Angeles. He was 102.
The cause was complications from kidney failure, said his daughter, Angela Lee. The family did not publicly announce the death.
Over a career spanning seven decades, Mr. Lee wrote nearly a dozen volumes of historical fiction, but his best-known work was his debut novel, "The Flower Drum Song," which brought instant literary stardom upon its release. He was called an overnight sensation, but in fact, he had spent years toiling in obscurity after having arrived in the United States from China on a student visa during World War II.
He wrote "The Flower Drum Song" while renting a room above a Filipino nightclub in San Francisco's Chinatown and working as an editor and columnist for one of the city's Chinese-language newspapers. The book concerned Wang Chi-yang, a first-generation Chinese immigrant struggling to accept the cultural and generational gap he had with his American-raised son, Wang Ta, particularly in matters of love and marriage.
Mr. Lee's agent was turned down by nearly every major publisher in New York and was about to give up after a year, when Farrar, Straus and Cudahy made a bid. Mr. Lee said the book's salvation came from an elderly man who had been paid by the publisher to screen manuscripts and had scrawled two words on the book before dying: "Read This."
In a review for the New York Times, novelist Idwal Jones said Mr. Lee "writes with no omission of slang and sex and every regard for the popular taste." The book shot up the bestseller list and caught the attention of screenwriter Joseph Fields, who persuaded the Broadway team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to adapt it for the stage. The three simplified Mr. Lee's narrative, and the musical comedy "Flower Drum Song" enjoyed a two-year run on Broadway, starting in 1958. The musical, which Mr. Lee said was "funny and more commercial" than his book, was directed by Gene Kelly and received several Tony Award nominations. It was the first mainstream play about Asians featuring a mostly Asian cast.
Japanese American actress Miyoshi Umeki portrayed Mei Li, the "picture bride" intended for Wang Ta, in the Broadway musical and its 1961 movie adaptation. James Shigeta starred in the film as Wang Ta, who is beguiled by the seductive showgirl Linda Low, played by Nancy Kwan. It was the first major Hollywood film about Asian Americans featuring a fully Asian cast and received five Oscar nominations.
As with the play, some critics viewed the film as an exotic stereotype of Chinese Americans that did not match the musical or dramatic standards of the Pacific Rim-set Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals "South Pacific" and "The King and I."
In the New Yorker, critic Brendan Gill called the movie an "elaborate fraud," bloated with "pseudo-Oriental intricacies . . . every bit as authentic as Fu Manchu."
More than a half-century later, in an interview with literary scholar Andrew Shin, Mr. Lee said he wrote the book for a broad American audience in the hope of windfall success, and he defended the way he depicted Asian Americans.
"I have received criticism, you see, saying that even the novel is a little stereotypical," he said. "But it was the period. I have written novels with characters who have bound feet and pigtails. But this is an accurate portrait of people during the period I was writing about. . . . So people who criticize the novel in that way forget about when the events take place. They just rush to say that I am stereotyping Chinese culture."
Mr. Lee's book fell out of critical favor and went out of print, in large part because it was so identified with the hit stage play and film.
In the late 1990s - after Mr. Lee had written several other Chinese-inspired novels that received little fanfare - there were stirrings of a revival of interest in the "Flower Drum Song" musical, championed by Asian American playwright David Henry Hwang, author of the Tony Award- winning drama "M. Butterfly."
Hwang had long called the film version of Mr. Lee's novel a guilty pleasure. "It was the only place on television where you could see Asians acting like Americans," he told the San Francisco Chronicle, noting that he often watched it despite its reputation as dull, sexist and "inauthentic." It also led him to the source material.
In 1996, Hwang received permission from the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization to proceed with a "revisical." He wrote a new libretto to better reflect the nuances of Mr. Lee's work - which Hwang said for the first time in American popular culture portrayed Asian women as "complex, fully human characters."
He tinkered with the conflict at the center of the plot: It would now hinge on whether to turn the father's failing opera house into a nightclub.
The musical was a high-profile hit when it opened in 2001 in Los Angeles. The show moved the next year to Broadway, where it was nominated for several Tony Awards and ran for 169 performances.
Hwang was also central to the 2002 reissue of Mr. Lee's novel by Penguin Books. In a foreword, Hwang said his introduction to the book was like "discovering a long-lost ancestor, a forgotten branch of my family tree, a missing piece of literary history for which I felt particular affinity."
Chin Yang Lee was born Dec. 23, 1915, in Hunan province, the youngest of 11 children of a rice farmer. He moved with his family to Beijing at 10. Amid the Japanese occupation, he left school to flee for safety on China's southern border with Burma, now known as Myanmar.
He spent a year and a half working as a secretary for a municipal chief - a self- proclaimed maharajah - in the border city of Mangshi. His job was to write English-language letters and entertain the chief's bored wife.
"The maharajah needed somebody to play badminton with her every day," Mr. Lee told the Chronicle. (The experience inspired his book "The Sawbwa and His Secretary: My Burmese Reminiscences," published in 1959.)
After Mr. Lee graduated from a university in Kunming, China, he said, his oldest brother - the de facto head of the siblings - ordered him to flee the war-torn country for his own good. "When my eldest brother told me, 'Get out!' I said, 'Where to?' " he recalled to the Chronicle. " 'America,' he said. I was surprised."
He hocked all his possessions to pay for his passage to New York in 1943, and he never saw his parents again.
He briefly enrolled at Columbia University to study comparative literature, but his ambitions were to study playwriting at Yale's graduate program with a professor who had once mentored Eugene O'Neill, whom Mr. Lee idolized. He received a master of fine arts degree in 1947 and was the only Asian in the drama school at the time, he said.
He won a short-story contest sponsored by Writer's Digest magazine in 1949, applied for permanent residence in the United States and later gained citizenship. His wife of 34 years, Joyce Lackey, died in 1997. In addition to his daughter, survivors include a son, Jay Lee, both of Los Angeles.
After "The Flower Drum Song," Mr. Lee published 10 other novels and a collection of short stories, many of which were translated into Chinese from English. They include "Lover's Point" (1958), about a Japanese American woman's love affairs in San Francisco, and "China Saga" (1987), a multigenerational family drama.
"China Saga," critic Carolyn See wrote in The Washington Post, left readers "happily overdosed on rapes, double murders, banners, kites, concubines, daring rescues and - at one notable banquet - a fish made out of wood." She also praised Mr. Lee's "clean and literate" prose style.
In Hwang's foreword to the 2002 reissue of "The Flower Drum Song," he called the novel an "Asian American classic." But Mr. Lee said in his interview with Shin, the literary scholar, "I never thought of it that way. I was just delighted if I could sell anything."

Howard Schultz deserves shot at presidency

Texto completo: "Howard Schultz -- more bitter than his coffee," tweeted the TV screenwriter Warren Leight on Wednesday, part of a torrent of social-media abuse, much of it from Hollywood, aimed at the former CEO and chairman of the Starbucks chain of coffeehouses. Schultz's sin? Declaring an intention, or at least having thoughts about an intention, to run for president of the United States as an independent.
According to CNN, similar invective was launched at Schultz by a heckler this week at a New York City event to promote Schultz's new book; the furious man referred to Schultz, who has a net worth in excess of $3 billion, as an "egotistical billionaire," and that was the nicest portion of his widely reported remarks. In The New York Times, the headline on a column by Michelle Goldberg read "Howard Schultz, Please Don't." And all manner of otherwise dignified elected officials took to nasty personal insults. By Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal was worrying about the impact on the stock price of Starbucks, which has seen explosive growth over the last decade. The Journal specifically cited former labor secretary Robert Reich's call for a boycott of the coffee brewer, should Schultz pursue his quest. No matter that Schultz is no longer directly involved with the business.
And no matter that most people would say that Schultz pursued progressive workplaces policies when he ran Starbucks -- for example, he offered health insurance and tuition benefits to many baristas and, to widespread criticism from conservatives, famously encouraged his employees to talk to their customers about race, which is precisely the opposite of what most corporate strategists would recommend.
It's worth noting that the outrage wasn't especially against what Schultz was saying on CBS' "60 Minutes" and elsewhere. It was the very fact that he had chosen to get into the race.
The anger on the left, of course, was rooted in the fear that Schultz, a self-declared centrist, would split the vote against Donald J. Trump, thus re-electing the detested president. The impact of a Schultz candidacy on the two main parties was, actually, open to debate: there also was an argument to be made that his candidacy might also hurt Trump. Still, the Democratic apoplexy was understandable.
But also misguided. It is on voters to be tactical in their voting strategy. Schultz is entitled to pursue his political ambitions, and disseminate his ideas, just like any other American. Otherwise our democracy suffers. We need capable and creative people to run for president, if only to improve the exchange of ideas.
There is a useful analogy here in the arts. Take, for example, the roughly 200 nonprofit theaters that exist in Chicago. If half those companies went away, the remaining 100 would be far stronger financially and would attract larger audiences. But that's not how artistic ambition operates -- creative people want to have their own shot and a vibrant cultural community allows them to do precisely that. To fail to support an exciting new company on the grounds that it would negatively impact the existing players would be a ridiculous position for anyone to take. If Chicago did that either on a governmental or a personal level, progressive artists would be outraged, and rightly so.
Audiences choose where they want to spend their money and donors decide whom they want to support -- and that is how theaters live or die. But the Goodman cannot lobby pre-emptively against new competition; rather, it has to welcome everyone, at least in public, and then prove itself competitive on its stages.
Or consider restaurants. Chefs and owners know that they are working in an overcrowded, high-failure field -- and even the red-hot existing eateries are well aware that a hipper destination might soon well open just down the block. But that does not stop new graduates of cooking and hospitality schools from joining the fray for all the right kinds of reasons -- they have a passion for what they are doing, they believe in their own talent, they see a need that they consider unfulfilled, and, above all, they are following their art.
We all benefit from their risk-taking, even when they fail.
Of course, Schultz's wealth gives him privileged access, but he hardly is alone there, either in politics or the arts, both fields widely populated not just by those who made their money like Schultz but by those who had it handed to them on a plate. Sure, he has an ego, but then it takes a hefty one to run for president and maybe also to command a top-grade kitchen.
To label Schultz an egotist -- or a spoiler -- just because he has a vision he considers not to belong to either party is unfair. Even un-American. It is partly why we often get lousy candidates. Why does Schultz, a smart guy with lots of interesting ideas, not deserve his shot? All he has done so far is say that he hopes to be on the ballot.
After all, if the rival candidates are all we hope they will be, he won't do any serious damage.

Texto completo: Once a bazaar and kosher slaughterhouse for Kazimierz, Krakow's old Jewish quarter, Plac Nowy -- or "New Square" -- is today known for its open-air flea market and food stalls.
So on a recent visit, I ordered zapiekanka (a traditional Polish sandwich) and perused the souvenir stands as I waited for the cheese to melt.
There were, of course, shot glasses, figurines, mood rings and other standard tourist trinkets.
And then there were the "Heil Hitler" signs.
The sale of Nazi memorabilia might seem troubling in a country where three million Jewish residents and as many as three million non-Jewish Poles were murdered under Nazi occupation during World War II. (Among those Jews were my great-grandmother's family members in Białystok.) It might also seem unusual in a place where the government has taken bold steps to quash free speech and control the historical narrative.
Yet Nazi swag is not uncommon in Poland today, and it's particularly easy to find in tourist hubs. (Alongside the "Heil Hitler" keepsakes were National Socialist party signs; in a neighboring stall was gear with the Soviet-era hammer and sickle.)
Laws prohibiting the promotion of Nazi ideology or Holocaust denial exist in about a dozen European countries including Poland, a policy that should -- in theory -- regulate the sale of items like those I encountered in Kazimierz. But several legal experts and scholars, likening the offense to a petty crime or the crossing of a red light, said that the rule is little enforced there.
I was traveling through Germany and Poland with the Fellowships at Auschwitz for the Study of Professional Ethics, a program that looks at the role of journalists, lawyers, doctors, businesspeople and religious leaders in the Holocaust. Following several days of study in Berlin and Krakow, we had spent the morning exploring Kazimierz before a drive to Auschwitz and Birkenau, the Nazi concentration and death camps. A few of us were grabbing lunch for the road when we noticed the "Heil Hitler" signs for sale and, keeping with the themes of our trip, began debating the ethical questions they raised.
Nazi insignia on display in Poland is not new. Anti-Semitism in Poland is not new, either. But with the government's rightward drift, both are becoming increasingly problematic.
Violence against minority groups in Poland has remained high since the right-wing Law and Justice party took control in 2015, said Rafal Pankowski, a co-founder of Stowarzyszenie Nigdy Wiecej, the Never Again Association, which runs one of Poland's largest hate speech and hate crime registers. There was a notable spike in anti-Semitism following the passage of the controversial Holocaust law last February, he added, which made it a crime to accuse Poles of involvement in the genocide.
"I've been dealing with the issue of anti-Semitism for more than 20 years now, but I didn't think I would live to witness what we witnessed in Poland this year," Dr. Pankowski, a professor at Collegium Civitas in Warsaw, said in November. "We saw it this year in media and in politics on a level that I think is quite unprecedented in recent Polish history."
Eliza Rutynowska, the advocacy officer for the Polish Society of Anti-Discrimination Law, cited the recent Independence March in Warsaw as an example.
"We have a government that is openly supportive of far-right, alt-right rhetoric," Ms. Rutynowska said in light of the event, where nationalist activists shouting racist slogans marched behind President Andrzej Duda and elected officials. "We are very worried seeing this, because this directly translates to incidents on the street; we are hearing about hate crimes every week."
The assassination on Jan. 13 of Pawel Adamowicz, the left-leaning mayor of Gdansk who was stabbed to death onstage at a charity event, has further fueled a national discussion on hate speech in politics.
It's difficult to track whether the resurgence of neo-Nazism has caused a spike in the production of Nazi souvenirs. But the prevalence of these attitudes helps explain why I found "Heil Hitler" signs for sale in New Square, which was once called "Jewish Square" (Plac Zydowski).
There were 60,000 Jews living in Krakow before the war, a quarter of the population; today, there are about 200. The Jewish district now feels at once like a tribute to and a caricature of what it used to be: Outside the Old Synagogue (Poland's oldest), bright green trolleys advertising tours of Schindler's factory bounce along the cobblestone. Near Remuh Synagogue and the Old Cemetery are kitschy, Jewish-looking restaurants with Hebrew signs and waiters offering picture menus to passers-by.
Whatever the sentiment, seeing "Heil Hitler" signs in the neighborhood was jarring. But the legality of it, I soon learned, is an ongoing debate.
Article 256 of the Polish criminal code states:
"Whoever publicly promotes a fascist or other totalitarian system of state or incites hatred based on national, ethnic, race or religious differences or for reason of lack of any religious denomination shall be subject to a fine, the penalty of restriction of liberty or the penalty of deprivation of liberty for up to two years."
It continues:
"Whoever, in order to distribute, produces, records or brings, buys, stores, possesses, presents, transports or sends" the aforementioned items, or those with "fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbolism," can be subject to that punishment.
But there's a caveat: Violators are exempt "if the act was committed as part of artistic, educational, collecting or scientific activity." Sales of antiques or collectibles with some historic, academic or artistic value are permitted; sales of recent reproductions are not.
It's one of many ambiguities that makes the provision ineffective, according to Katarzyna du Vall, a lawyer in Krakow. "You don't know who is an artist, educator, collector or researcher," she said.
Another is the vocabulary. "The biggest problem from a legal perspective is what, exactly, 'totalitarian state' means," Ms. du Vall said, explaining how contemporary scholars -- political scientists, sociologists, lawyers and other experts -- cannot agree on one binding definition.
"We talk about Article 256 a lot in Poland, and people don't understand why those proceedings end up with nothing," she said. "It's really hard to enforce a law that is not clear for anybody -- for judges, for those who punish, for those who commit those crimes."
Rober Opas, a deputy chief of police in Warsaw, acknowledged the law and said violators would be punished. But "from our point of view," he said in an email, "the problem is sporadic, and we do not receive many reports of this kind." He also noted that it is the Polish court that determines the punishment for each perpetrator.
Because of the legal loopholes, though, cases concerned with the trade of racist or anti-Semitic paraphernalia rarely reach Poland's prosecutor general, said Ms. Rutynowska.
Although anti-Semitic incidents constituted half of all hate crimes in New York in 2018, I have yet to see a "Heil Hitler" sign at my local greenmarket or among the snow globes in Times Square. And while it's possible to locate just about anything on the internet, I can't easily find Nazi mementos on mainstream websites, either. Amazon stopped selling most products featuring Nazi symbols in July; eBay and Yahoo did the same almost two decades ago.
So I snapped a photo of the souvenir stand -- not unusual for any tourist in a public place -- put the camera away and sunk my teeth into my fresh-off-the-press zapiekanka. But before I'd finished chewing, the vendor had approached me angrily, demanding in Polish that I delete the picture. Photographing his goods was illegal, he told me, and he would call the police.
I didn't.
He came closer, shouted louder. "Delete the picture now," he insisted again, this time trying to enlist the help of our Polish tour guide to persuade me.
But I didn't.
Because if he was abiding by the law, so was I.

'16 Mystery calls weren't to father; Senate investigators say Trump Jr. business associates were on the line

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

Who is Ralph Northam, the Virginia governor who faces resignation calls after racist yearbook photo?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The backlash was nearly instant.
Within hours of a photo surfacing on Friday that showed Virginia's Democratic governor in a photo showing two people dressed in blackface in Ku Klux Klan robes, a chorus calling for Ralph Northam to resign grew and spread across social media.
The photo was part of Northam's 1984 yearbook during his last year at Eastern Virginia Medical School. A half-page with four photos of Northam included one of two people, one in a blackface costume and the other wearing a KKK robe.
Northam admitted he was in the photo and apologized, but did not detail which of the pictured individuals he was dressed up as.
So, who is Ralph Northam? Here's what you should know:
Soft-spoken and moderate
Northam is widely viewed as a moderate within his party, someone who says he voted twice for former Republican President George W. Bush.
He has described himself as a fiscal conservative but socially liberal, as Northam has advocated for tighter gun laws and loosening abortion restrictions. Republicans in the state at one point tried to recruit Northam to switch parties, according to the New York Times, something Northam rejected.
A former doctor, Northam is soft-spoken and was relatively unknown outside of Virginia when he took up a bid for governor.
Northam entered politics in 2007 when he ran and won a bid to become a state senator. In 2013, he took up a bid for lieutenant governor, winning the post to become second in command for then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
His military, medical history
Before his political career, Northam served as a doctor in the U. S. Army and treated soldiers overseas during the Gulf War.
He served eight years in the military and traveled to Germany where he tended to soldiers during Operation Desert Storm.
He attended both Virginia Military Institute and Eastern Virginia Medical School and, after completing his residency, started treating children as a pediatric neurologist.
He continued that work while serving as lieutenant governor, spending his days both at the state capitol and treating children suffering from illnesses.
Response to Charlottesville
The deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville stunned the nation and thrust the small, southern city into the epicenter of a radical discussion about race and anti-Semitism.
After the 2017 rally, which left one woman dead and several injured after a neo-Nazi rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters, politics became even divisive.
President Donald Trump cast blame on "both sides" and said "you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides," causing an uproar that took over the news cycle for days.
Northam, after the rally, denounced the "ugly" event and praised the city and its residents for promoting a place that values "openness, diversity and inclusion," according to the Washington Post.
"White supremacists have descended upon Charlottesville again to evoke a reaction as ugly and violent as their beliefs — just as they did before, I am urging Virginians to deny them the satisfaction," Northam said in a statement.

An effort to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee led to the rally and violence.
Northam, at first, supported the removal of all Confederate statues in the aftermath of the event. He later changed his mind, saying it should be left up to local officials.
Racially charged governor's race
Northam ran for governor in 2017 in the aftermath of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, an event that shifted politics in the state.
The rally drew neo-Nazis and members of the alt-right, many of whom carried Confederate flags or wore clothing with Nazi or KKK insignias.
The November 2017 election was one of Virginia's most racially charged in recent memory and ended with Northam beating Republican Ed Gillespie.
Voters were peppered with ads about the Charlottesville unrest.
Many of Northam's attack ads focused on Gillespie's lobbying efforts but one mailer sought to compare Gillespie with the white nationalists who rallied in the city. The mailer, which included a photo of Gillespie and white nationalists, said the election was a chance to "stand up. . . to hate. "
Obama campaigned for him
During the 2017 campaign for governor, Northam was one of the candidates that former President Barack Obama supported.
During a rally in October 2017 rally, Obama, the first black president of the U. S. , campaigned for Northam and addressed the events of Charlottesville, saying one rises by not repeating the past.
"You know, Ralph believes that if we're going to talk about history hen we should do it in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds, not in a way that divides," Obama said. "We saw what happened in Charlottesville. But we also saw what happened after Charlottesville when the biggest gatherings of all rejected fear and rejected hate. "
The former president continued: "That's how we rise. We don't rise up by repeating the past. We rise up by learning from the past and by listening to each other and knowing that we're all flawed. But we still try to preserve some baseline measure of goodness and decency and patriotism and we look for the good in other people, not the worst. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren apologized to Cherokee Nation tribal leaders this week for the hurt her much-publicized DNA test caused them, marking a sharp contrast to her public defense of the results thus far on the campaign trail.
During a phone call Thursday with Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker, Warren apologized for how her DNA test caused “confusion" about the tribe's right to determine its own membership, Cherokee Nation spokeswoman Julie Hubbard said in a statement.
“The chief and secretary of state appreciate that she has reaffirmed that she is not a Cherokee Nation citizen or a citizen of any tribal nation," Hubbard said.
“We are encouraged by this dialogue and understanding that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests."
The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment
The DNA test has become a flash point for the Democrat, who is expected to officially announce her presidential candidacy next Saturday in Massachusetts.
Though the test showed that she likely has an indigenous ancestor six to 10 generations back, her touting of the results in a highly produced video to back up her claims of Cherokee ancestry outraged some Native Americans.
Instead of sweeping aside lingering questions about her identifying as Native American for several years as a law professor, the test results triggered a barrage of criticism and calls to apologize.
The Cherokee Nation and some Native American activists harshly criticized the release of the DNA results, saying it elevated President Trump's racial attacks and reinforced harmful ideas about “blood quantum" determining tribal identity.
The secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation, Chuck Hoskin Jr., wrote in an op-ed in the Tulsa World earlier this week that it does “harm" to tribes when people such as Warren “boast" they are native due to the results of a DNA test.
Warren has defended her decision on the campaign trail amid the backlash. Asked by a voter in Sioux City, Iowa, in early January why she took the test, Warren said she wanted to “put it all out there" and be transparent.
But she also took steps to emphasize that she was not claiming minority status, telling audiences, “I am not a person of color," and underscoring that she recognizes only tribes can decide who are members.
Though Warren hasn't faced questions about the DNA tests in recent campaign stops, her apology is an admission that she needed to do more to repair ties with the Native American community. And it also suggests this disputed piece of her life story may continue to cause trouble for her as a candidate.
Warren's critics in the Cherokee community, for example, want a more public reckoning.
“Calling the leadership of the Cherokee Nation is definitely a necessary step in the process, but it needs to be followed up by a public apology and also for her to just stop claiming to have Cherokee heritage," said Rebecca Nagle, a Cherokee activist who's been critical of Warren.
David Cornsilk, a Cherokee genealogist and historian whose work showed that Warren could not document her claims to Cherokee ancestry, said he found the apology “totally lacking."
“Where is her public statement?" he asked. “Where is she saying, 'I apologize to the Cherokee Nation, I am sorry that I did this and here's how I intend to make it right'?"
Warren has taken other steps to reach out to tribal members in recent months. After her first campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Warren met privately with Frank LaMere, a member of the Winnebago tribe of Nebraska and associate chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party.
In an interview, LaMere said the two did not discuss the DNA test, although they did touch on Trump's insults about her claims of Native American heritage.
“I acknowledged that she has taken a lot of heat from the president," he said, adding, “I simply mentioned to her that I appreciate her resolve and her commitment."
LaMere said they talked about other issues that affect Native Americans, and said that her response to the question about the controversy in Sioux City had put the issue to rest.

Texto completo: When University of Iowa officials canceled classes Tuesday before dangerously low temperatures gripped the Midwest, Gerald Belz and his parents agreed he would stay in Iowa City instead of driving home to Cedar Rapids in his truck, which had mechanical issues.
Belz, who was studying to become a doctor and was in his second semester, was found unresponsive outside Halsey Hall at 2:48 a.m. Wednesday and was pronounced dead at an area hospital. UI police said they believe Belz, 18, died from exposure to the extreme cold.
"At the time I thought that was the smart move," his father, Michael Belz, told the New York Times. "I didn't want him to get stuck somewhere driving. So he decided he would stay."
UI police declined to say how long they believe Belz was outside before he was noticed by a patrolling officer or where he was headed Wednesday. They are investigating Belz's death but said they don't expect foul play.
Belz's father said emergency-room doctors assured him that no alcohol was found in his son's system. Results from an autopsy could take six to eight weeks to be finalized, the Johnson County Medical Examiner's office confirmed.
Michael Belz told the New York Times he last saw his son on Sunday night. He said he ushered his son out the door of their Cedar Rapids home as snow began to fall that night, worrying the young college student would face slick roads driving back to campus.
Around 10 p.m. on Sunday, Belz called home to tell his parents he'd made it back to school safely.
Belz's father, Michael Belz, met with campus police Thursday. He declined to talk to the Iowa City Press-Citizen.
Gerald Belz's former classmates and teachers remember him as a sharp student and a constant source of encouragement.
The air temperature was 22 degrees below zero at 2:52 a.m. Wednesday, with a wind chill of minus 51 degrees. In extreme cold, hypothermia can set in in as little as five minutes in temperatures of minus 50 degrees if a person is wearing inadequate winter clothing or skin is exposed, especially the scalp, hands, fingers or face. At 30 below zero, hypothermia can set in in about 10 minutes.
Gerald Belz died on Jan. 30 after exposure to extreme weather on the University of Iowa campus. His fellow teammates remember him as quiet, but fiercely encouraging.

Texto completo: No-Fry Eggplant Parmesan
5 to 6 servings
Jamie Oliver's original recipe is designed to be lighter than most eggplant Parm recipes and uses only Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. In testing, we added a modest amount of gooey mozzarella and swapped his fine bread crumbs for more panko.
You'll need a 9-inch square baking dish or pan.
Serve with crusty bread.
MAKE AHEAD: The dish can be assembled up to a day in advance and refrigerated. Let it come to room temperature on the counter while the oven preheats. Leftovers reheat well in the microwave, though the panko won't be as crisp.
Adapted from "Jamie's Italy," by Jamie Oliver (Hachette, 2006), as posted online by the New York Times.
Ingredients
3 medium eggplant, trimmed and cut crosswise into
1/2
-inch slices (about 3 pounds total)
1/4
cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing (may use cooking oil spray instead of brushing on the oil)
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 large onion, finely chopped (1
1/2
to 2 cups)
1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced
1 1/2
teaspoons dried oregano
28 ounces canned, no-salt-added crushed tomatoes, plus their juices
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1/2
cup packed fresh basil leaves, torn
1/2
cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
8 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced (not packed in water)
1 cup panko
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves (from 1 stem; optional)
Steps
Position a rack 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element; preheat the broiler. Line two rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil.
Brush both sides of the eggplant slices with some oil and season lightly with salt and pepper, arranging them in a single layer on the baking sheets. Broil one sheet at a time for 10 minutes, rotating the pan from front to back halfway through, until the eggplant is soft and somewhat browned. Turn over the slices and broil for 2 minutes, just until they begin to dry out, with a hint of browning on the surface. Let cool slightly. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees.
Meanwhile, heat half the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion and cook for about 10 minutes, until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and dried oregano; cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until fragrant.
Add the crushed tomatoes and their juices; increase the heat to medium-high and cook just until the liquid starts to bubble, then partially cover, reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes to form a slightly thickened sauce. Stir in the vinegar and basil, then season lightly with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat.
Spoon just enough of the sauce to thinly coat the bottom of your 9-inch square baking dish or pan. Add a single layer of the broiled eggplant slices, using about a third of them and overlapping slightly as needed. Spread a third of the remaining sauce over the eggplant, followed by a third of the Parmigiano-Reggiano and half the mozzarella. Repeat with another third of the eggplant, sauce and Parm and then the rest of the mozzarella. Finish with the remaining eggplant, sauce and Parm.
Stir together the panko, the remaining oil and the fresh oregano, if using, in a medium bowl, until evenly coated. Scatter the mixture evenly over the top of the eggplant Parm. Bake (at 375 degrees, middle rack) for 35 to 40 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling, the top is golden brown and the center is hot.
Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Minshew's offbeat path to Senior Bowl

Texto completo: "I feel like I've always been overlooked. Everybody has their own sob story or whatever adversity they have, but it's something that I carry with me. More than proving everybody wrong, it's about proving the people that believe in me right."
Gardner Minshew
Brandon High School graduate
Statistics and accolades don't always attract the attention they may deserve — not even in your own backyard.
Gardner Minshew knows that all too well. He threw for 3,541 yards and 31 touchdowns during his senior year at Brandon High School, reached the Class 6A South State championship and still had to start his college career as a walk-on. Without much buzz through the recruiting process, including in-state, he made the decision to attend Troy University on a full academic scholarship early that spring to hopefully gain a head start on his competition.
Minshew, however, never found his fit — admittedly a possible result of his own immaturity — and decided to transfer to Northwest Mississippi Community College. As a freshman, he led the team to its first national title since 1992 while posting 3,288 yards and 28 touchdowns. Despite helping lift the program to a championship level in the ranks of a competitive Mississippi junior college system, his phone wasn't exactly ringing off the hook with scholarship offers.
"I feel like I've always been overlooked," Minshew said. "Everybody has their own sob story or whatever adversity they have, but it's something that I carry with me. More than proving everybody wrong, it's about proving the people that believe in me right."
Minshew was close to settling down with the Rangers for another season before East Carolina entered the picture, becoming the next stop on his unusual journey. In two years at ECU, Minshew fought for playing time as a part-time starter. He played in 17 games, starting in just seven, and graduated with a degree in communications. Upon graduation, Minshew had the ability to transfer without penalty, meaning he could play immediately at any school that wanted him. After throwing for more than 1,000 yards across his final three starts, Minshew was finally receiving the interest he'd been waiting for.
"I had a blast at East Carolina," Minshew reflected. "I developed a lot of great relationships. I'm still friends with all those guys. Leaving there was one of the hardest things I've had to do, but I felt like it was the right decision for me. I had to be a little bit selfish."
The then-defending national champions caught his eye. Alabama was searching for a backup in case one of its quarterbacks transferred, and promised Minshew a graduate assistant coaching position once he was done playing. Coaching is something for which Minshew has a passion, and learning under arguably the greatest college football coach of all time in Nick Saban would be a great way to start such a career. But once both Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa stayed put, the graduate transfer was no longer making a trip to Tuscaloosa.
Instead, a different coaching hero came calling. Washington State head coach Mike Leach had long fascinated Minshew, from his Air Raid passing concepts to his 2011 New York Times best seller, "Swing Your Sword: Leading the Charge in Football and Life." Leach called with a simple proposition: how would you like to lead the nation in passing? It was a dream come true for Minshew, who knew he'd have the chance to prosper and stack up wins in Leach's offense — even if Leach had only extended his offer to the East Carolina quarterback because of a fondness, among many odd affinities Leach has, for... pirates.
"I'm convinced that's the only reason he recruited me," Minshew joked. "I think that had a serious impact on his decision."
All jokes aside, when the call with Leach ended there wasn't much else for him to consider.
"That was it," he said. "I was sold."
The bet he placed on himself paid off. Minshew did in fact lead the nation in passing with 367.6 yards per game, went 11-2 and finished fifth in Heisman Trophy voting. "The Mississippi Mustache" took Pullman, Washington by storm. Cougar fans hadn't witnessed a 10-win regular season since Minshew was seven years old, and he added a 28-26 win over Iowa State in the Alamo Bowl to put a bow on his college experience.
"It was different, that's for sure," Minshew said. "Definitely not how most people do it. You just learn so much as you go through all these different experiences, all the different locker rooms, all the different guys you meet — it teaches you stuff, and I feel like it's really prepared me for now."
Being overlooked doesn't stop there, though. The same song and dance follows him as he attempts to find a home at the next level.
Minshew accepted his invite to the Reese's Senior Bowl to make an impression on NFL teams alongside more highly coveted quarterback prospects like Duke's Daniel Jones, Missouri's Drew Lock and West Virginia's Will Grier. He was aware scouts wouldn't be amazed at the weigh-ins, but his spirit as a competitor and leader surely helped his case while interviewing and splitting reps throughout the week.
"The biggest thing this week is proving yourself," Minshew said. "You're with a lot of great players, but you want to prove that not only you belong, but that you're the best one here. That's in everything you do — interviews with teams, then going out to practice and finally a game. You just want to be the best in really every facet.
"I'm not going to come in and measure super great in anything, but you know what? When I go out there, I can play football. If that's what they're looking for, then there's a spot for me."
On the third and final day of practice at the Senior Bowl, San Francisco 49ers general manager John Lynch seemed to agree that a roster spot will likely be waiting for Minshew somewhere. San Francisco isn't in the market for a signal caller, so the NFL Network crew pressed him for insight on the QB group displayed in Mobile, Alabama. Lynch caught himself before giving up too much information not only to the viewers, but also other NFL teams.
"That kid has some legitimate swag," Lynch said. "He's calling our coaches last week telling the mistakes in the playbooks. He was on it too. He's a guy that just has something to him. You know, there's certain guys — and I'm doing everybody else's work for them so I've got to shut up — but he's one of those guys that's been awful fun to be around."
49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan was in charge of the Senior Bowl's South roster, which Minshew was placed on because of his Mississippi roots. Minshew completed only one of his eight passes in the actual game Saturday, which the North side won 34-24, but doing everything else right during his time in the Azalea City still has his stock on the rise. It's one of the reasons he was among the three players named South team captains.
Shanahan's offense is one that Minshew kept up with frequently throughout the past year. When good friend and former Southern Miss quarterback Nick Mullens became San Francisco's field general due to injuries, Minshew was watching every second. Mullens went undrafted in 2018 and proved when he got the chance that he wasn't just a fluke or a story to smile at, but that he actually belongs in the NFL.
All Minshew wants is a similar shot.
"At the end of the day, it doesn't matter where I go [in the NFL draft]," Minshew said. "I just need a chance. I think I've proved that time and time again. If I get a chance to be on the field, I think I'll do well."

Texto completo: This year's Holocaust Remembrance Day, marked on Sunday, unfolded against a troubling backdrop. The resurgence of anti-Semitism in many countries is one of the major stories of our time - and there are no easy answers on how to deal with it.
Many, especially American conservatives, see a major threat of anti-Semitism from the left - manifested in virulent hostility toward Israel and especially the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign. This campaign, they say, applies a double standard to Israel, treating it as "the Jews" - an international pariah accused of nefarious control over other countries' leaders and of other underhanded and evil deeds.
Critics of Israel counter that this is a manifestly unfair accusation. Israel and its supporters, they say, try to silence legitimate if harsh polemics against Israel's policies by invoking the specter of anti-Semitism and even by using state power to punish boycotts of Israel, through laws that forbid state institutions from doing business with those who participate in such boycotts.
For those of us who support Israel but also believe in freedom of speech and oppose identity politics, these are wrenching issues. The anti-boycott laws primarily regulate commercial activity, but sometimes impinge on speech and expression - for instance, when they target artists or public speakers or punish the advocacy of an Israel boycott, all First Amendment violations. And to say that animus toward Israel is always anti-Semitic comes uncomfortably close to labeling certain opinions - such as disapproval of black or feminist activist groups - racist or misogynist. Israel is a state, and one with controversial policies. One can be critical of a state and its leadership without hating its people, or people of the same ethnicity and culture in other countries.
Sometimes, Israel's supporters deploy the charge of anti-Semitism unfairly - for instance, in response to cartoons that satirize Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu and use Jewish symbolism such as the six-pointed star, which is also a part of the Israeli flag.
But it is also undeniably true that anti-Israel rhetoric often lapses into overt hatred of Jews. In many majority-Muslim countries, anti-Israel propaganda frequently employs overtly anti-Semitic tropes. In the United States, novelist Alice Walker recently came under fire for recommending a book called "And the Truth Shall Set You Free" by British author David Icke in a New York Times interview. Icke's book posits a Jewish conspiracy seeking world domination. Walker has stood by the recommendation and said that she is being punished for her pro-Palestinian advocacy and her support for an Israel boycott.
If some critics of Israel have been unfairly labeled anti-Semitic, it is equally true that quite a few anti-Semites use Palestinian causes and criticism of Israel as camouflage.
Women's March activist Tamika Mallory, who has come under scrutiny for her association with the Jew-hating Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, recently stoked controversy when she refused to say whether she believes that Israel has a right to exist. Some say the question is an unfair one, since it is never asked about other countries. But most other countries don't have organizations and movements dedicated to their destruction.
To question Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state is distinct from criticism of Israel. One can certainly criticize Israel's treatment of its minorities. But proposals that would turn Israel and the Palestinian territories to a single Arab-majority state would almost certainly have catastrophic consequences, from mass expulsion to genocide.
When public figures harbor thoughts of Israel's destruction, Holocaust Remembrance Day acquires a grim new relevance.

Lawsuit Filed in Police Shooting of Unarmed Black Man

Texto completo: Lawyers for the family of Stephon Clark, the unarmed black man who was fatally shot last March by Sacramento police officers, filed a wrongful-death lawsuit on Monday alleging that the officers who fired had racially profiled the 22-year-old and used excessive force.
The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, names the two officers -- Terrence Mercadal and Jared Robinet -- as well as the City of Sacramento as defendants. It seeks at least $20 million in damages and was filed on behalf of Mr. Clark's two sons, his parents and his grandparents.
According to the 31-page lawsuit, the officers failed to identify themselves as police or issue verbal warnings about their intent to use deadly force before firing 20 times at Mr. Clark, who was killed in his grandmother's backyard and was later found to have been holding a cellphone, but no gun. It also faults the officers for having deprived Mr. Clark of lifesaving medical care.
During the encounter, Mr. Clark's civil rights were violated in several ways, his family's lawyers argued. "There were other reasonable options available other than shooting and killing" Mr. Clark, the complaint said.
"This family deserves answers and full transparency from the officers, the city and the Sacramento Police Department on the unjustified use of excessive and lethal force that killed Stephon Clark and robbed his children of a future with their father," Brian Panish, a lawyer for Mr. Clark's children, said in a statement.
Both California's attorney general Xavier Becerra and the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office have said they would review any criminal aspects of the case. In a statement released on Monday, the District Attorney's Office said it had received a "voluminous investigative report" about the shooting from the Sacramento Police Department on Oct. 25. Then, earlier this month, the office said it had "received further substantial investigative reports and related materials" from investigators with the state's Office of the Attorney General.
"Our timeline for completion of our review has thus been delayed as we process the supplemental materials," the district attorney's statement said. "We will take whatever time is needed to ensure a fair, thorough, and accurate review of this matter."
Responding on behalf of the city, Susana Alcala-Wood, the Sacramento city attorney, declined to comment "out of deference to the judicial process and because this is a matter of active litigation."
The Sacramento Police Department did not respond to requests for comment and it did not appear as though the police have publicly identified the officers involved in the shooting. The Sacramento Police Officers Association also did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment. Attempts to reach Officers Mercadal and Robinet were not successful; it is not clear if the men have obtained lawyers.
Mr. Clark's encounter with the police began on the evening of March 18 when two officers from the Sacramento Police Department were dispatched to investigate a complaint about someone breaking car windows.
With the apparent guidance from a sheriff's helicopter, the police officers soon spotted Mr. Clark, who they said ran from them. They followed him into the backyard and ordered him to show his hands, police video shows. Seconds later, in the dark, one officer shouted, "gun, gun, gun, gun!" and the police opened fire. The police said later that the officers believed Mr. Clark had a weapon and opened fire "fearing for their lives."
[The visual investigations team at The New York Times reviewed more than 50 police videos of the aftermath. See the team's analysis here.]
The officers looked for a gun but found only a cellphone. In addition, the two officers involved in the shooting muted the audio feeds to their body cameras. One of the officers was black and the other was white; both were later placed on paid administrative leave.
The entire episode lasted about 10 minutes, but it roiled Sacramento for days. Protesters stormed City Hall and took to the streets, with many demanding that the two officers involved be fired. More broadly, critics of the police have said the shooting was just the latest demonstration that the authorities across the country treat black residents with disdain. In recent years, police shootings of black men -- including Alton B. Sterling in 2016, Walter L. Scott in 2015 and Michael Brown in 2014 -- have been caught on camera and raised nationwide concern about structural racism, police training and use-of-force protocols.
"We are filing a civil action today because nothing will change in America until the wrongful death of a black man is met with requisite justice, because justice equals respect -- not only for Stephon, but for all black people," said Ben Crump, a lawyer for Mr. Clark's family.
An autopsy commissioned by Mr. Clark's family showed that he was struck eight times, mostly in his back. However, the official autopsy report released weeks later by the Sacramento County coroner's office said Mr. Clark was hit by only seven bullets; and although the county report found that three of the bullets entered on the right side of Mr. Clark's back, the forensic pathologist whom Sacramento officials asked to review the autopsy said the apparent sequence of the bullets did "not support the assertion that Clark was shot primarily from behind."

If Ocasio-Cortez were a conservative...

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were a conservative, all anyone would be talking about is how uninformed she is. She would be facing trick questions from reporters designed to expose her lack of knowledge, and brutal sketches on “Saturday Night Live” mocking her intelligence and fitness for office. Instead, SNL fawns over her, while CBS’s “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert — far from making jokes at her expense — eats ice cream with her and asks how many and “f — s” she gives about her critics.
Boy, it’s good to be a socialist.
It’s not that there is a lack of material. This week, for example, Ocasio-Cortez declared that “the world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” She has said that $21 trillion in “Pentagon accounting errors” could pay for most of her massive $32 trillion Medicare-for-all plan — as if there were $21 trillion in unspent tax dollars sitting around in a Pentagon vault. She opined that “just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for” — unaware, apparently, that the entire Pentagon budget is $716 billion. She wrongly claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement “is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009” — when ICE is required only to have that number of beds available and that number has remained flat. She has declared that “unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs” — which is flat untrue. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only 6 million to 7 million Americans with two jobs and 148 million with just one.
Those are examples of ignorance. But apparently she is also dishonest. This week, she told Colbert that she has not been able to open a district office yet to handle constituent casework because of the federal government shutdown. “There’s a lot of things we can’t do as freshman members,” she said. “We can’t properly set up our district offices. We can’t get laptops delivered. We can’t start doing the work that we were elected here to do. … It takes the green stuff. And those workers are furloughed.”
That’s wrong. Last September, Congress passed the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, which funds congressional salaries and offices for the coming year. Ocasio-Cortez knows this because, unlike furloughed workers, she is getting paid. The New York Times reports that the three other first-term members from New York have managed to open offices in their districts. A more likely explanation is that Ocasio-Cortez is spending her time building her national media profile instead of taking care of the constituents who sent her to Washington in the first place.
So where are the articles bemoaning “The incredible, thuggish stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez”? Where are the journalists trying to trip her up with questions like “Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine?” to see if she knows what it is? Nowhere to be found. To their credit, the fact-checkers have been on the case. PolitiFact gave her unemployment claim a “Pants on Fire” rating, and she is rapidly accumulating a large cache of Post Pinnochios — so much so that she claims to be the victim of “false equivalency + bias.” Give me a break. She told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that “being morally right” is more important than “being precisely, factually ... correct.” Apparently, facts matter less as long as you support Big Government.
But facts are crucial, especially when you are proposing the largest increase in government spending in human history. Vox recently added up the cost of all her proposals — from Medicare-for-all, to free college, guaranteed jobs and the “Green New Deal.” The price tag was $42.5 trillion over the next decade — more than twice the current national debt. Sorry, you can’t pay for that through Pentagon accounting errors.
It is a tremendous testament to America that someone who was working as a bartender in a Mexican restaurant a year ago can throw their hat into the ring, unseat a 10-term member of Congress and be elected to the House of Representatives. It’s what makes this such an exceptional nation. And it is obvious that she has political talent. But that doesn’t excuse her from the responsibilities as a legislator to learn the facts and serve her constituents. Even Whoopi Goldberg, an Ocasio-Cortez supporter, warned her on “The View,” “I would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.”
That’s good advice. Once people decide you are ignorant, it’s hard to recover — just ask Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. Of course, they were conservatives, so the standards are different.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway isn't letting negative reviews of "Serenity," her new film with Matthew McConaughey, change her opinion of the project.
The 36-year-old actress shared a photo on Instagram of her look from the "Serenity" New York premiere, with a message saying she's standing by the film.
"We keep it real around here: some critics get @serenityfilm and, like me, find it interesting, moving, ambitious and different, and for some it just doesn’t work," she wrote. "That’s cool- there is no failure, only learned events, not everyone has to like everything, and the critical response doesn’t change my feelings about the movie.
"However, other people’s time and money are not to be taken for granted, so I just want to be clear: I endorse the movie, many critics don’t," she added. "Anyway, wasn’t my @givenchyofficial skirt for the premiere rad?"
Critics: Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey's 'Serenity' is 'the daftest movie of 2019'
The movie, which stars McConaughey as a fishing boat captain and Hathaway as his ex-wife, was lambasted by critics for its wacky plot.
"The more we learn about that half of things the less sense the rest of the movie makes," Wesley Morris wrote for The New York Times. "That includes a big reveal that’s like the worst of Christopher Nolan, M. Night Shyamalan and the condolence-card section at Walgreens. "
The Arizona Republic's Andy Cordova agreed, writing, "A twist ending satisfies when it's surprising yet logical: You look back and say, 'Oh, now I see what that meant' and you piece together how things add up. That's fun. ' But when an inane ending appears out of nowhere and purports to add depth to a movie which has little? That's just maddening. And the twist in 'Serenity' leaves you feeling both cheated and annoyed, which surely isn't the filmmaker's intention. "

An increase in vaping among teens and progressively smaller devices is making it harder for local schools to follow ...

Texto completo: The contraband was scattered across a large conference table last week at North Central High School.
Principal Steve Fisk pondered the paraphernalia, the meager spoils of a cat-and-mouse game that's played out every day in locker rooms and bathroom stalls in every high school in America.
On the table were dozens of e-cigarettes, every manner of vaping devices and two crumpled cigarette butts.
"We don't see too many of these anymore," Fisk said of the butts.
Across the table, Glover Middle School Principal Mark Lund recalled the days of busting kids for cigarettes: the yellowed teeth, the smell and the shame.
"For adolescents, that was a big negative - how they looked and how they smelled," Lund said. "Now they come out of the bathroom smelling like candy."
At Glover, some who use vaping devices are as young as 10. They are the new generation of young nicotine addicts, and hundreds of them live in Spokane.
"It's an epidemic, and it's happening here," Fisk said.
Spokane's new health scare
According to a national report released last month, vaping was the second-most common form of substance abuse, behind alcohol, among teens and adolescents.
The study, called Monitoring the Future, showed that 17.6 percent of eighth-graders, 32.3 percent of high school sophomores and 37.3 percent of seniors reporting vaping during the past year.
Despite the efforts of health officials, educators and parents, those numbers are up substantially from the year before.
"No one can look at the data and say there's no problem," FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said last month.
"We cannot allow a whole new generation to become addicted to nicotine," said Gottlieb, who recently declared youth vaping an "epidemic" and threatened to halt sales of flavored electronic cigarettes if major manufacturers can't show more evidence they're doing enough to keep them away from minors.
Some experts consider e-cigarettes to be safer than traditional smokes, but the data is too tentative for researchers to understand the long-term health effects.
For that reason, some public health experts call today's vaping teens a "guinea pig generation."
Unlike some national trends, this one didn't leave Spokane behind. Instead, it has settled like a sweet mist in almost every school in Spokane.
According to Paige McGowan, program coordinator for the Tobacco, Vaping and Marijuana Prevention Program at the Spokane Regional Health District, e-cigarettes "weren't even on the radar" until 2014.
That's when a survey showed that 26 percent of Spokane County 10th-graders reported using e-cigs or vaping devices.
"It was overnight," McGowan said. "All of a sudden vaping is a thing, and we have vaping products widely available in Spokane."
For anyone 18 years or older, they're available not only at specialty stores, but hundreds of convenience stores.
An obvious problem for schools is that many high-schoolers are 18, and they purchase the devices for underage friends.
Ashley Gould, the chief administrative officer of Juul, said the company's products are intended solely for adults who want to quit smoking.
"We do not want kids using our products," she told the New York Times. "Our product is not only not for kids, it's not for non-nicotine users."
Yet Juuls and other products sit behind the counter, bright packages holding enticing flavors.
"Like gummi bear and cucumber," said Lund, who has confiscated the devices from dozens of seventh- and eighth-graders.
Moments later, Shawn Jordan, the supervisor of secondary education for Spokane Public Schools, carries in another box. One of the vaping cylinders had sprung a leak, filling the room with the aroma of overly-sweet strawberries.
Seizing the moment, Fisk grabbed his phone and announced that vapes are available in 7,750 flavors under 460 brands.
"It's a problem all right," Fisk said.
A hidden menace
The problem for schools is that vaping devices are difficult to detect.
Even during class, a student can pin the device to a shirt collar or bra strap, lean over and take a hit, as most vapes raise only the slightest plume.
At North Central, Fisk and his staff follow their noses in a ritual that steals hundreds of work hours.
"You walk into a bathroom and you smell that typical fragrance that isn't air freshener and it's not a cigarette," Fisk said. "But it definitely has a sweet smell and then you follow up."
After confiscating the devices, Spokane school officials take extensive corrective measures.
At North Central, for example, a first offense means one to two weeks of lunch detention, plus mandatory reading of a research report on the health risks of vaping. The offender also must write a commentary on the subject.
Moreover, parents are contacted and the confiscated devices destroyed.
"In the majority of cases the parents were not aware that their kids had them," Fisk said.
Others knew about the problem, but rationalized that vaping was less hazardous than smoking.
According to Jordan, the problem is growing throughout Spokane Public Schools. During the 2016-17 school year, schools reported 125 incidents, mostly related to vaping.
That number soared to 186 last year and is poised to do so again; halfway through the current school year, officials have reported 218 incidents, of which 11 occurred at elementary schools.
A culture war
is joined
Five years ago, the Spokane Regional Health District engaged students at Mica Peak, an alternative school in the Central Valley School District.
"Over the years our conversation has shifted from combustible cigarettes to vaping," said AJ Sanders, a member of the Spokane Regional Health Board.
More concerning, Sanders said, was the revelation from students throughout Spokane County that some students now list vaping as a "hobby."
For others, vaping is the latest way to fit in with peers, some of whom wear pens on a necklace in mimicry of how some vapes are carried.
But despite the worrisome trends, Lund sees hope that the cure will come from the majority of kids who don't carry vaping devices in their backpacks.
"A lot of kids are so frustrated," Lund said. "People are getting tired of it."

vaping
Health experts still uncertain about vaping's long-term effects
When it comes to vaping, some teens are too smart for their own good.
They've become experts at hiding their habit, yet are often ignorant about the long-term effects.
"We're very concerned," said Paige McGowan, program coordinator for the Tobacco, Vaping and Marijuana Prevention Program at the Spokane Regional Health District.
Noting that teenage brains are still developing, McGowan said, "there's not enough research and we don't know the long-term effects."
Marketed to adult smokers as a method to quit smoking, Juul and other brands contain varying amounts of nicotine.
Nicotine can affect learning, memory and attention in the teenage brain, but there's little research on how e-cigarette vapor affects lungs, which do not fully mature until the 20s.
They also contain flavorings such as diacetyl, a chemical linked to lung disease; cancer-causing chemicals such as formaldehyde; and heavy metals such as tin, nickel and lead.
The amount of nicotine ingested depends on the product. For example, data published by Juul Labs indicates that in its standard 5 percent nicotine strength pods, 10 puffs are equivalent to one cigarette.
However, e-cigarette vapor lacks the harshness of traditional cigarettes, which makes it easier to pick up the habit.

Texto completo: They had spent years on the staff of Donald Trump's golf club, winning employee-of-the-month awards and receiving glowing letters of recommendation.
Some were trusted enough to hold the keys to Eric Trump's weekend home. They were experienced enough to know that when Donald Trump ordered chicken wings, they were to serve him two orders on one plate.
But on Jan. 18, about a dozen employees at Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., were summoned, one by one, to talk with a human resources executive from Trump headquarters.

During the meetings, they were fired because they are undocumented immigrants, according to interviews with the workers and their attorney. The fired workers are from Latin America.
The sudden firings -- which were previously unreported -- follow last year's revelations of undocumented labor at a Trump club in New Jersey, where employees were subsequently dismissed. The firings show Trump's business was relying on workers in the country illegally even as the president demanded a border wall to keep out such immigrants.
Trump's demand for border wall funding led to the government shutdown that ended Friday after 35 days.
In Westchester County, workers were told Trump's company had just audited their immigration documents -- the ones they had submitted years earlier -- and found them to be fake.
"Unfortunately, this means the club must end its employment relationship with you today," the Trump executive said, according to a recording that one worker made of her firing.
"I started to cry," said Gabriel Sedano, a former maintenance worker from Mexico who was among those fired. He had worked at the club since 2005. "I told them they needed to consider us. I had worked almost 15 years for them in this club, and I'd given the best of myself to this job.
"I'd never done anything wrong, only work and work," he added. "They said they didn't have any comments to make."
The mass firings at the New York golf club -- which workers said eliminated about half of the club's wintertime staff -- follow a story in the New York Times last year that featured an undocumented worker at another Trump club in Bedminster, N.J. After that story, Trump's company fired undocumented workers at the Bedminster club, according to former workers there.
President Trump still owns his businesses, which include 16 golf courses and 11 hotels around the world. He has given day-to-day control of the businesses to his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.
In an emailed statement, Eric Trump said, "We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment. Where identified, any individual will be terminated immediately."
He added that it is one of the reasons "my father is fighting so hard for immigration reform. The system is broken."
Eric Trump did not respond to specific questions about how many undocumented workers had been fired at other Trump properties and whether the company had, in the past, made similar audits of its employees' immigration paperwork. He also did not answer whether executives had previously been aware that they employed undocumented workers.
This Trump golf club does not appear in the government's list of participants in the E-Verify system, which allows employers to confirm their employees are in the country legally. Eric Trump did not answer a question about whether the club would join the system.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
The firings highlight a stark tension between Trump's public stance on immigration and the private conduct of Trump's business.
In public, Trump has argued that undocumented immigrants have harmed American workers by driving down wages. That was part of why Trump demanded a border wall and contemplated declaring a national emergency to get it.
But, in Westchester County, Trump seems to have benefited from the same dynamic he denounces. His undocumented workers said they provided Trump with cheap labor. In return, they got steady work and few questions.
"They said absolutely nothing. They never said, 'Your Social Security number is bad' or 'Something is wrong,' " said Margarita Cruz, a housekeeping employee from Mexico who was fired after eight years at the club. "Nothing. Nothing. Until right now."
In June 2016, Trump gave a campaign speech at the Westchester club and recounted how he had hugged mothers and fathers whose children had been murdered by illegal immigrants.
"On immigration policy, 'America First' means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or 10th generation," Trump said in his speech. "No matter who you are, we're going to protect your job because, let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies."
To document the firings at the golf course, the Washington Post spoke with 16 current and former workers at the course -- which sits among ritzy homes in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., 27 miles north of Manhattan. Post reporters met with former employees for interviews in a cramped apartment in Ossining, N.Y., a hardscrabble town next door where the chief landmark is the Sing Sing state prison.
The workers brought pay stubs and employee awards and uniforms to back up their claims. They said they were going public because they felt discarded: After working so long for Trump's company, they said they were fired with no warning and no severance.
"Keep us in mind," Cruz said, addressing Trump and the country.
The interviews were organized by an attorney, Anibal Romero, who is also representing undocumented workers from Trump's club in Bedminster.
The Trump Organization has shown "a pattern and practice of hiring undocumented immigrants, not only in New Jersey, but also in New York," Romero said. "We are demanding a full and thorough investigation from federal authorities."
Edmundo Morocho, an Ecuadorean maintenance worker, said he was hired around 2000 with a green card and Social Security card that he said he purchased in Queens for about $50. The green card he showed the Washington Post says it expired in 2002, but a decade passed before the Trump club told him that he needed to replace it, he said.
Morocho bought a new card, he said. It had a different birth date than the first one, but he said the Trump club didn't raise questions. The Post viewed both cards. It was unclear if they were forged or stolen.
"The accountant took copies and said, 'OK, it's fine,' " Morocho recalled. "He didn't say anything more." Eric Trump did not respond to a question asking about the club's process for reviewing employees' immigration documents.
Another employee -- Jesus Lira, a banquet chef from Mexico -- said that, on two occasions in 2008, an accountant at the Trump club rejected his fake documents and told him to go obtain better ones.
"She said, 'I can't accept this, go back and tell them to do a better job,'" Lira recalled. He said he returned to Queens a third time and found documents that the club accepted. Eric Trump did not respond to a question about Lira's account.
The Post spoke to two former managers from the club about the employees' accounts. One former manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the club's internal practices, said the club relied on its accounting department to scrutinize the immigration documents and that the department rejected about 20% of applicants because of immigration questions.
The other former manager said the broader Trump Organization placed far more emphasis on finding cheap labor than it placed on rooting out undocumented workers. The former manager characterized the attitude at the club as "don't ask, don't tell."
"It didn't matter. They didn't care" about immigration status, said the former manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve ties with current Trump executives. "It was, 'Get the cheapest labor possible.' " The former manager said the assumption at the club was that immigration authorities were not likely to target golf clubs for mass raids.

James W.C. White: View that liberal arts majors face lower earning potential is a myth

Texto completo: Illustration Students pass the sundial near Norlin Library on the University of Colorado campus on Wednesday.

The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point plans to cut some of its core programs in the liberal arts, including French, German and history, The New York Times recently reported .
This is news because it reflects a common view — among students, parents and many pundits — that liberal arts majors face diminished lifelong-earning potential and career success. That view is a myth — a myth with significant consequences extending far beyond UW-Stevens Point.
Since the great recession, the number of college students nationwide majoring in history and English, two staples of the humanities, has been cut nearly in half. At the same time, students majoring in science, technology, engineering and math — or STEM — have risen sharply.
But actual data refute the myth that drives the trend:
For instance, within six months of graduation from the University of Colorado, 91 percent of graduates are either working full time or in graduate school, our research indicates. This is true across the wide range of majors, from physics to philosophy to anthropology.
Nationwide, people with college degrees — regardless of whether those degrees were in the arts and humanities, social sciences or natural sciences — have consistently experienced significantly lower rates of unemployment than the workforce as a whole. This was true even in the worst days of the recession.
Yes, students who major in scientific, technological or engineering fields tend to earn more early in their careers, but the effect is temporary. By the time they reach peak-earning years (in their 50s and 60s) former students who majored in the social sciences or arts and humanities earned more, on average, than their peers who majored in professional or pre-professional fields, research from the Association of American Colleges and Universities concluded in 2014.
Those results mirror an exhaustive study of alumni who graduated from the CU Boulder College of Arts and Sciences in the last three decades. The research, conducted by Emsi Alumni Insight, surveyed more than 25,000 alumni who graduated with bachelor's degrees between 1989 and 2018 and calculated their average salary in 2018 as follows:
• $79,626: arts and humanities alumni
• $78,065: social sciences alumni
• $80,796: natural sciences alumni
By comparison, median household income in Colorado was $62,520 in 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau reports. These results should surprise no one. Employers pay for skills they value, and employees who do what they love (not what they thought was most lucrative) are especially valuable.
For me, science was the right choice. Chemistry captured my imagination when I was an undergraduate, and I applied that scientific foundation as I earned advanced degrees in earth sciences. I've worked for decades studying how our planet functions, and as humans are a major cause of change today, that work required me to understand better how humans operate, from economics to ethics.
Yes, I'm a scientist, but I am one who knows that a broad liberal-arts education is widely applicable, greatly needed and significantly helpful to job-seekers and the companies that hire them. A liberal arts education — one that exposes students to the breadth of human knowledge — conveys skills in critical thinking, communication and adaptability. As the pace of social and technological change inexorably quickens, these skills are indispensable.
The leaders of many major corporations exemplify this. Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, holds a bachelor's degree in communications. Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, earned bachelor's degrees in history and literature. And Steve Ells, co-CEO of Chipotle, earned a degree in art history from CU. They followed their intellectual passion and curiosity in college and applied these skills in the worlds of business and technology.
The late Steve Jobs, co-founder and former CEO of Apple, once summarized the importance of the liberal arts in this way: "It is in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough — it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing."
Clearly America needs scientists, engineers and mathematicians, but America also needs historians, political scientists and Chinese majors — liberal arts graduates who are writers, critical thinkers and highly adaptable leaders.
While a single voice can have impact, consider the power, grace, variability and versatility of a choir, and their ability to make our hearts sing. America has many voices and talents, and we need them all to meet the challenges of a changing world. The liberal arts make that happen. Find your own voice there.

Texto completo: On paper, the six-day strike teachers strike that disrupted learning at 900 public schools across Los Angeles was a fight about orthodox demands like lower class sizes, higher pay and more support staff from nurses to librarians and counselors.
But a core issue and perhaps the most divisive barely touched the bargaining table: the future of the city’s 224 charter schools.
Education policy experts contend that although United Teachers Los Angeles – the union that represents the teachers in L.A. Unified – wins regarding charter schools at the strike’s conclusion may be largely symbolic, the strike has sparked a broader conversation happening across Southern California on charters that will likely make its way to Sacramento and stands to impact the direction of public school districts across the state.
Public education is essentially a two-sector system codified into state law in 1992 – the traditional, centrally managed school district and charter schools independent from a central school board.
As enrollment in the Los Angeles school district declined for 15 years, charter schools grew into a full-fledged industry educating more than 112,000 students and posing tough competition for traditional public schools.
Angeleno enrollment in charters, which are publicly funded but privately managed, reportedly drains $600 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is tasked with serving around half a million students. While the schools do undergo a rigorous approval process complimented by hundreds of pages of paperwork, they operate free from many regulations and all but a few are nonunion.
To clear up any confusion about district-affiliated versus independent charters, a district-affiliated charter is a hybrid. The word “charter” in its name reflects a status the school adopted to secure more outside sources of revenue but it operates within the confines of the district.
During the strike
In the months leading up to and during the six-day walkout, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl frequently decried “the unregulated growth of charter schools” to the press and his own membership.
“That doesn’t mean all charter schools are bad,” he repeated in his characteristic baritone, rather what began as a well-intentioned experiment now undermines traditional public schooling as more charter schools backed by billionaires and neglect the neediest students.
Charter school advocates call the union’s messaging on charters during the strike a blatant mischaracterization.
“I’d really like Alex Caputo-Pearl to come to the schools I run,” said Gloria Romero, the executive director of Scholarship Prep Charter School in Santa Ana and a former California state senator who while representing the San Gabriel Valley and East Los Angeles served as chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee.
“We’re closing the achievement gap for children who are English language learners and special education, if anything. There are some great schools in L.A. Unified but there are too many pockets where schools are chronically underperforming.”
John Rogers, director of the UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, warned of sometimes superficial narratives surrounding charter schools.
“I think there are a number of somewhat simplistic analyses that don’t capture the full picture,” he said. “Many charter schools enroll large numbers of low-income students and students of color and we shouldn’t forget that fact.”
That said, charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns, including in Los Angeles, where billionaire and charter supporter Eli Broad spent almost $10 million in 2017 along with allies in an effort that won a majority on the LAUSD Board of Education.
The charter sector, according to Rogers, is “a mix of some amazing educators who have worked within district bureaucracies and got frustrated and wanted in their words more freedom, some wealthy people who wanted to do good and felt like their money wasn’t going to be spent well in the district, and then some with ties to right wing think tanks and organizations who are deeply committed to undercutting the power of unions as kind of a bulwark of the democratic party.”
He added that it is rare for charters to admit students with the most substantial special needs, but that’s mostly backed up only by anecdotal evidence.
In the agreement
The main appearance of charter schools in the 40-page agreement reached between UTLA and LAUSD this Tuesday is a provision calling for more community input in cases of potential co-location, when a charter school moves into either occupied or un-occupied space on the campus of a traditional public school.
The still-temporary deal must be ratified by the School Board in a meeting slated for Jan. 29.
“The district has to inform us in December about any schools that are targeted for co-location,” said Caputo-Pearl on KPCC’s AirTalk Wednesday. “That gives time for respectful notice to parents … and certainly parents can ask questions and teachers can push back.”
As a side-bargain, UTLA also said the school board agreed to vote this month on a resolution that calls for Gov. Newsom to enact a cap on new charter schools at LAUSD while the state further studies the issue. If approved, the resolution would be a call for more state action on public charter schools.
Yet “it remains to be seen” whether the measures become more than a symbolic win for the union, said author of a book on California politics and New York Times opinion writer Miriam Pawel.
One out of every three independent charter schools in Los Angeles is co-located. While the arrangements are mutually beneficial, many complain of discord as entirely separate schools attempt to share everything from libraries to cafeterias and playgrounds.
“Co-location seemed to be a significant step for the union potentially. But the district doesn’t have has much leeway, so I think those are issues that will have to be addressed at the state level, and there’s definitely some interest in addressing it in Sacramento.”
Looking ahead
What all parties appear to agree on is that the teachers strike drew attention from the Inland Empire to L.A. to the befallen state of traditional public education in the second-largest school system in the nation, but that the future of charters can only be determined in halls of the state capital.
“The strike opened the conversation about how the broader public can begin to develop rules and regulations through the legislative process,” said Rogers, “purposeful planning of how we bring on new charter schools, how we reauthorize charter schools, how we think about the location of charter schools.”
And charter leaders like Gloria Romero are prepared to make a case.
“I look forward to sitting at that table testifying before former colleagues and new folks to say hey forget about the campaign contributions that you got from CTA (California Teachers Association) and let’s think about what this means in terms of student achievement,” she said.
“The fact that charters are thought to be so dangerous, that’s a product of their success and that’s what I hope a fair hearing in Sacramento would find.”

Oceans Getting Louder, Posing Threats To Marine Life

Texto completo: Slow-moving, hulking ships crisscross miles of ocean in a lawn-mower pattern, wielding an array of 12 to 48 air guns blasting pressurized air repeatedly into the depths of the ocean.
The sound waves hit the seafloor, penetrating miles into it, and bounce back to the surface, where they are picked up by hydrophones. The acoustic patterns form a three-dimensional map of where oil and gas most likely lie.
The seismic air guns probably produce the loudest noise that humans use regularly underwater, and it is about to become far louder in the Atlantic. As part of the Trump administration’s plans to allow offshore drilling for gas and oil exploration, five companies have been given permits to carry out seismic mapping with the air guns all along the Eastern Seaboard, from central Florida to the Northeast, for the first time in three decades. The surveys have not started yet in the Atlantic, but now that the ban on offshore drilling has been lifted, companies can be granted access to explore regions along the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific.
And air guns are now the most common method companies use to map the ocean floor.
“They fire approximately every 10 seconds around the clock for months at a time,” said Douglas Nowacek, a professor of marine conservation technology at Duke University. “They have been detected 4,000 kilometers away. These are huge, huge impacts.”
The prospect of incessant underwater sonic tests is the latest example cited by environmentalists and others of the growing problem of ocean noise, spawning lawsuits against some industries and governments as well as spurring more research into the potential dangers for marine life.
Some scientists say the noises from air guns, ship sonar and general tanker traffic can cause the gradual or even outright death of sea creatures, from the giants to the tiniest - whales, dolphins, fish, squid, octopuses and even plankton. Other effects include impairing animals’ hearing, brain hemorrhaging and the drowning out of communication sounds important for survival, experts say.
So great is the growing din in the world’s oceans that experts fear it is fundamentally disrupting the marine ecosystem, diminishing populations of some species as the noise levels disturb feeding, reproduction and social behavior.
A 2017 study, for example, found that a loud blast, softer than the sound of a seismic air gun, killed nearly two-thirds of the zooplankton in three-quarters of a mile on either side. Tiny organisms at the bottom of the food chain, zooplankton provide a food source for everything from great whales to shrimp. Krill, a tiny crustacean vital to whales and other animals, were especially hard hit, according to one study.
“Researchers saw a complete absence of life around the air gun,” said Michael Jasny, director of marine mammal protection for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of several environmental groups suing the federal government in an effort to stop the seismic surveys.
Measuring sounds of commerce
Each seismic shot from the air guns is estimated to reach up to 200 decibels. Container ships, another noisemaker on the seas, make sounds up to 190 decibels. (The launch of a space shuttle, by contrast, reaches about 160 decibels for those nearby. )
Every 10 decibels is an order of magnitude. An explosion of 200 decibels, then, is 10 times more intense than the sound of a container ship. Because water is much denser than air, sound travels underwater about four times faster and much farther than above the sea’s surface.
“At any one time, there are 20, 30 or 40 seismic surveys going on around the world,” for oil and gas exploration, as well as for geological research, Nowacek said.
All told in the first year of the newly approved exploration, more than 5 million of these huge explosions would occur all along the United States’ eastern coastline.
Christopher Clark, a senior researcher in the bioacoustics program at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, who has studied whale communication for 40 years, described the noise as a “living hell” for undersea life, which is exquisitely tuned to sound.
A coalition of environmental groups has filed suit against the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, claiming the agency is violating several federal laws protecting wildlife, including the Endangered Species Act, by allowing the blasts. And governors from 10 states have protested the offshore drilling decision and are seeking to join the legal action.
Harming or injuring marine mammals is forbidden under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In November, NOAA issued five authorizations allowing seismic exploration companies to “incidentally, but not intentionally, harass marine mammals.” Because of the government shutdown, other government action to begin testing has been postponed until at least March 1.
The companies involved in the exploration disagree sharply with the claims of harm. “More than 50 years of extensive surveying and scientific research indicate that the risk of direct physical injury to marine mammals is extremely low,” Gail Adams-Jackson, vice president of communications for the International Association of Geophysical Contractors, said in a statement. She contended that the groups’ efforts are solely aimed at stopping offshore exploration and development.
The companies and NOAA Fisheries said the effects on marine life could be kept to a minimum by careful monitoring and mitigation
Carrying sound across the ocean
Years of constant blasts could be extremely harmful, others argue, and not just for right whales. Because of the way sound reverberates in the ocean, the noise can be unrelenting.
“Prolonged chronic stress of any kind is bad, because it shunts resources away from reproduction,” Nowacek said. “It presses your adrenal glands to produce adrenaline and stress hormones, causes weight loss and immunosuppression.”
Voluntary efforts to turn down the volume are having an effect: The Port of Vancouver started the ECHO (Enhancing Cetacean Habitat and Observation) Program, asking mariners to reduce noise by having ships slow down and fix cavitation on the propellers.

Trump hid his Russia dealings from US voters

Texto completo: Americans might soon learn what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found out about potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
But there's one Trump-Moscow link where the emerging evidence is already as damning as it is disturbing.
During much, if not all, of Trump's campaign he sought to enrich himself by pursuing a luxury hotel-condominium-office deal in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.
And as a candidate, Trump repeatedly misled or lied to voters about his business with Russia. "I have nothing to do with Russia," he told reporters in July 2016. "I don't deal there," he said during the Oct. 9 presidential debate. The truth is Trump had coveted a lucrative hotel project in Russia — whether to build one or license his name to be emblazoned on a skyscraper — for decades. "We will be in Moscow at some point," he said in a 2007 deposition.
Later, as a presidential candidate, he secretly signed an 18-page letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow on Oct.28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.
Court filings by Mueller in November make clear that negotiations led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen continued through at least June 2016. Cohen lied about this to Congress to "give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and ... the very first primary,'" according to the filings.
You have to wonder what the fallout would have been if those negotiations had been exposed before Trump debated his Republican primary opponents or Hillary Clinton. The electorate certainly was robbed of knowing about this crucial information at a time when:
There were news reports that Russia was interfering in the election.
Trump was expressing admiration for President Vladimir Putin, even as he was insulting hundreds of other people, places and things on Twitter.
The candidate said that, as president, he would consider easing sanctions placed against Russia for its violent seizure of Crimea.
Trump was questioning America's continued role in NATO, a bulwark against Russian aggression that Putin has historically despised.
A plank in the GOP platform regarding U.S. support for Ukraine was watered down.
Trump challenged Moscow to release Democratic emails that Russians were reported to have hacked.
Exactly when the Trump Tower Moscow "opportunity" collapsed remains murky. On Sunday, the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quoted Trump as telling him that project talks were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won." By Monday, Giuliani was scrambling to walk back his comments to The New York Times and other news outlets.
But whether Trump was pursuing the arrangement until he clinched the Republican nomination, or right up until he was elected president, isn't the main point. What matters is that a presidential candidate was secretly negotiating a profitable business deal with a major U.S. adversary — an extraordinary conflict of interest that was concealed from voters. —USA TODAY

Texto completo: Although there have been approximately 100,000 media profiles of enthusiastic blue-collar Trump supporters in diners, the reality is that Donald Trump is extraordinarily unpopular. A recent Pew analysis found only one other modern president with such a low approval rating two years into his administration.
On the other hand, that president was Ronald Reagan, who went on to win re-election in a landslide. So some Trump boosters are suggesting their champion can repeat that performance. Can he?
No, he can't. And it's worth understanding why, both to assess current political prospects and to debunk the Reagan mythology still infesting U.S. conservatism.
Let's talk first about the Reagan story.
Reagan was indeed unpopular in January 1983, mainly because of the economic situation. Despite a huge tax cut in 1981 and a sharp rise in military spending, more than 10 percent of the labor force was unemployed.
Although many voters blamed Reagan for this economic distress, the truth was that it had little to do with his policies; it was, instead, the consequence of the Federal Reserve's attempts to bring down inflation, which had driven interest rates as high as 19 percent.
By mid-1982, however, the Fed had reversed course, sharply reducing rates. And these rate cuts eventually produced a huge housing boom, which in turn drove a rapid economic recovery.
Like the earlier slump, this boom had little to do with Reagan's policies, but voters gave him credit anyway. Unemployment was still fairly high - more than 7 percent - in November 1984, but what matters for elections is whether things are getting better or worse, not how good they are in absolute terms. And in 1983-1984, unemployment fell fast, so Reagan won big.
How does this story compare with President Donald Trump's prospects now?
First of all, where Reagan was unpopular because of a weak economy, Mr. Trump is unpopular despite a strong economy. That is, he starts from a much lower baseline.
And there is no chance of a "morning in America"-type boom over the next two years.
For one thing, in 1983-1984, America was able to grow fast by taking up the huge amount of economic slack that had accumulated during the double-dip recession from 1979 to 1982. Now, with unemployment below 4 percent, it's not clear there's any economic slack at all. There's certainly not enough to allow the 7-plus percent growth rates in real personal income that prevailed in the run-up to the 1984 election.
Also, a housing boom driven by dramatic interest rate reductions was central to the rapid growth of Reagan's third and fourth year in office. (No, it wasn't all about the miraculous effects of tax cuts.)
But today's Fed can't - literally can't - deliver the kind of boost it did back then by bringing double-digit interest rates down to single-digit levels, because rates are already quite low. And with housing prices looking rather high, it's hard to imagine a huge surge looking forward.
Are there other ways that the economy might rescue Mr. Trump? What about the 2017 tax cut, which Mr. Trump said would be "rocket fuel" for the economy?
Well, by increasing the budget deficit, that cut probably gave the economy some stimulus, temporarily raising growth. But that effect is already fading and the economy would have been slowing down even without the extra drag created by the Trump shutdown. This doesn't necessarily mean that we'll have a recession soon, but we're almost surely looking at unimpressive growth at best.
But wasn't the tax cut supposed to increase long-run growth, by increasing business investment? Yes, it was - but it isn't delivering on that promise. Corporations received huge tax breaks, but they mostly used the money to pay higher dividends and buy back stocks, not for investment. And even the modest rise in business investment that did take place in 2018 seems to have been driven by higher oil prices, not tax cuts.
So Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan.
Actually, even Ronald Reagan was no Ronald Reagan. Although right-wing legend portrays his experience as proof of the magical power of tax cuts, the economy actually performed somewhat better under Bill Clinton, who raised taxes. Nearly all Republicans seem to have expunged that fact from their memories.
Most of Reagan's political success reflected not fundamental economic achievement but good luck with the timing of the business cycle. And Mr. Trump almost certainly won't experience comparable luck.
Combine this lack of a strong economic upside over the next two years with Mr. Trump's extreme current unpopularity, and his chances for re-election - if he even makes it to the end of his first term - don't look good. Which raises the question of what he and his party will do if defeat is staring them in the face.
I don't know the answer to that question, and if you aren't scared about how a cornered Mr. Trump might lash out, you haven't been paying attention.
What's clear, however, is that Mr. Trump and his allies are in a deep hole right now - and the economy isn't going to dig them out of it.

Texto completo: Like so many who became addicted to painkillers and later overdosed and died, Cheryl Juaire's son was a good kid, a jokester and a people person, his mother says.
Corey J. Merrill started on OxyContin, the potent opioid made by Purdue Pharma. When addiction took hold, he turned to heroin, his mother said. He died in 2011 at age 23.
Juaire, of Marlborough, was among dozens of parents who have lost children to addiction who protested outside Suffolk Superior Court on Friday as lawyers for Purdue argued to keep concealed many pages of a lawsuit against the company brought by the Massachusetts attorney general's office. Purdue is accused of helping to spawn the opioid epidemic by aggressively marketing its powerful painkiller, OxyContin.
“They're criminals who did this all for greed and profit," Juaire said.
The parents stood in the cold for hours, clutching posters and photographs of their children. Some wore T-shirts emblazoned with a son or daughter's smiling face. They said they want Purdue and its executives held accountable for their critical role in the opioid crisis.
“I believe the Sackler family is the reason why we have this opioid epidemic," said Tony LaGreca of Duxbury, referring to the family that controls Purdue. “They've made billions of dollars killing our kids."
LaGreca said his son, Matthew, became addicted to opioids after a football injury resulted in a prescription for 100 pills of oxycodone. He died from an overdose years later, in 2014.
Carol Lorento of Boston said Purdue deserves blame for irresponsible marketing — and “lies, greed, and poor judgment" — that led to the opioid crisis. Her son, Derek, received a prescription for OxyContin after an arm fracture in high school and later used heroin. He died in 2016.
Now, Lorento is responsible for raising her 6-year-old grandson. “He knows that his dada's in heaven," she said.
Officials at Purdue, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said in a statement Friday that the company is working on several efforts to combat drug abuse and addiction, including initiatives to teach teenagers about the dangers of opioids.
“We share the protesters' concern about the opioid crisis, and respect their right to peacefully express themselves," spokesman Bob Josephson said. “Purdue is committed to working collaboratively with those affected by this public health crisis on meaningful solutions to help stem the tide of opioid-related overdose deaths."
The state Department of Public Health said there were 1,518 opioid-related overdose deaths in Massachusetts in the first nine months of 2018. That figure includes both confirmed and estimated deaths.
Attorney General Maura Healey has accused Purdue of misleading doctors and patients about the addiction and overdose risks of its medications in a lawsuit originally filed in June. The suit also named current and former Purdue executives and members of the Sackler family, which controls the privately held Purdue, as defendants.
An updated, 300-plus-page complaint from Healey's office filed last week contained newly public portions that showed Purdue executives and the Sacklers demanding greater sales of their medications despite the risks. The complaint alleges the company pressured salespeople to push physicians to prescribe higher doses of their drugs for longer periods of time to more patients.
Much of the document remains redacted, however, so a group of media organizations — including The Boston Globe, STAT, WBUR, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times — filed a motion to release the full document.
“Every day that goes by where this document is substantially under seal is a day that the public does not have access to newsworthy and important information," Jeffrey J. Pyle, a lawyer for the media organizations, argued Friday before Judge Janet L. Sanders.
Purdue lawyers, in a motion, have said “there is simply no urgent or compelling need to justify the media consortium's demand to immediately receive confidential information," arguing that releasing the full document would undermine the court processes with which the company is cooperating. Purdue faces several lawsuits in other states.
Timothy C. Blank, a lawyer for Purdue, said Friday that the company is also concerned about business trade secrets being made public.
The judge said she would rule on the redacted documents by early next week.
Healey sat in the courtroom throughout the two-hour hearing. Speaking with reporters afterward, she described it as “a good development" in the case.
“These families have had to endure so much in terms of stigma," Healey said. “It is really rich for this corporate defendant and corporate officers and directors to come forward and, under the guise of fear of embarrassment or shame about their alleged misconduct, to claim that this information shouldn't come to light."
“The public deserves to know," she said.
On her way into the courthouse, Healey hugged some of the teary-eyed mothers who had gathered outside in protest. “Our children need you!" one woman exclaimed.
Lynn Wencus, bundled in a puffy purple coat, wore a sandwich board of smiling faces — all young adults who died from overdoses — and she held a separate photo of her son, Jeff, who died in 2017.
“It's very important that we show their faces and say their names to remember them," said Wencus, of Wrentham. “I pray my son's death won't be in vain."

Texto completo: Joseph R. Biden Jr. defended his decision to praise an embattled Republican lawmaker during a paid speech in Michigan last fall, telling a group of mayors on Thursday morning that it reflected his philosophy of how to "get things done."
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Mr. Biden had earned $200,000 for an October speaking engagement in Benton Harbor, Mich., three weeks before the midterm elections. During that speech, Mr. Biden gave a glowing commendation to Representative Fred Upton, a powerful Republican who joined with Mr. Biden to increase funding for cancer research and, separately, helped forge legislation to gut the Affordable Care Act.
In Washington Thursday, Mr. Biden offered a forceful defense of his supportive remarks about Mr. Upton, signaling that he has no intention of blunting his instinct toward bipartisanship and compromise in the event that he runs for president. The former vice president has told allies in recent weeks that he is leaning toward running against President Trump in 2020.
"I read in The New York Times today that I -- that one of my problems is if I ever run for president, I like Republicans," Mr. Biden said, according to a video posted by the public-affairs network C-Span.
He joked: "O.K., well, bless me father, for I have sinned."
"Fred Upton, I went out and spoke at an event and he was there and I praised him about the fight against cancer," Mr. Biden continued, citing Mr. Upton's role in passing the 21st Century Cures Act. "It mattered, saved people's lives and he stepped up, he and three other Republicans stepped up and helped us pass it. So I acknowledged that and now I'm -- I don't know what I am."
Mr. Biden did not mention the speaking fee he received for his trip to Michigan, or address Mr. Upton's role in the drive to repeal the Obama administration's signature health care law, two dimensions of his Benton Harbor appearance that complicate Mr. Biden's depiction of his remarks as a case study in old-school conciliation.
In a statement published Wednesday, Mr. Upton described Mr. Biden's praise for him as a surprise and an "immense honor."
Mr. Biden campaigned widely around the country during the midterm elections and made a particularly strong effort for Democrats in the Midwest, including elsewhere in Michigan.
But in Mr. Upton's district, Mr. Biden's favorable comments were used in Republican advertising in the final weeks of his re-election campaign against Matt Longjohn, a Democrat who was a national Y.M.C.A. health official. Mr. Upton ultimately won re-election by four and a half percentage points, the narrowest margin of his career.
The article describing Mr. Biden's speech to the Economic Club stirred particularly strong criticism of the former vice president among liberal Democrats, who view him as an ideological centrist and distrust his philosophy of aisle-crossing political compromise.

Tesla to cut workforce by 7%, faces 'difficult' road

Texto completo: Describing a "very difficult" road ahead, Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday said the automaker would cut its staff by about 7 percent.
The Palo Alto, California-based company grew by 30 percent last year, but struggles to remain profitable at that staffing level, Musk said in a memo to Tesla employees also posted on the company's website. The company had a "tiny profit" in the third quarter and expects to post an even smaller one in the fourth quarter, Musk said.
Tesla must make the job cuts as it ramps up production of the Model 3, he said.
"While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people," Musk said. "We will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles."
A 7 percent staff reduction would mean about 3,150 employees would be let go, based on Musk's tweet in October that Tesla has 45,000 employees.
"We unfortunately have no choice but to reduce full-time employee headcount by approximately 7 percent ... and retain only the most critical temps and contractors," Musk said.
Tesla delivered more than 245,000 electric cars and SUVs last year, nearly as many as all previous years combined. But its 2018 production fell far short of a goal set nearly three years ago of manufacturing 500,000 vehicles for the year. That goal was announced in May 2016 based on advance orders for its mid-range Model 3, which Musk said sells for $44,000.
"Higher volume and manufacturing design improvements are crucial for Tesla to achieve the economies of scale required to manufacture the standard range (220 mile), standard interior Model 3 at $35k and still be a viable company," Musk said. "There isn't any other way."
Tesla's shares fell earlier this month after it cut vehicle prices by $2,000 and announced fourth-quarter sales figures that fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company faces growing competition from other automakers including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Nissan.
"Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we're up against massive, entrenched competitors," he said. "The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products."
"Attempting to build affordable clean energy products at scale necessarily requires extreme effort and relentless creativity," he said in the memo, "but succeeding in our mission is essential to ensure that the future is good, so we must do everything we can to advance the cause."
Tesla will begin selling the Model 3 in Europe and China in February, a significant milestone in the company's global goals. Its factory in Shanghai is its first outside the United States.
Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 13 percent to close at $302.26 on Friday. While the "knee jerk reaction" to the company's news may be negative, the long-term view for Tesla is positive, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives in a note to investors.
"We continue to believe Tesla will be able to emerge from the next 12 to 18 months a stronger, profitable more product diversified (geographically and price points) EV company helping lay the groundwork for Model 3 as a linchpin of growth going forward into 2020 and beyond," wrote Ives, whose firm maintains an "Outperform" rating on Tesla's stock.
The staffing reductions come after a tumultuous year for Musk and Tesla. In September, the CEO agreed to step down as company chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine as part of a fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC had filed a complaint charging Musk with making a "false and misleading" statement when he tweeted in August that the company had enough funding to go private.
Also in September, Musk was seen apparently smoking marijuana in a video podcast with comedian Joe Rogan. The Tesla CEO had described 2018 as "the most difficult and painful" year of his career in an interview with The New York Times.
That led media mogul turned sleep advocate Arianna Huffington to issue an open letter to Musk suggesting he get more rest.
He replied in his own tweet: "Ford & Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy," he replied. "I just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not."

Texto completo: The video snippet and initial story went viral, as they say, on social media and was quickly picked up by mainstream media outlets.
A group of racist teens wearing Make America Great Again hats disrupted a peaceful Native American demonstrator in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., the story line went. For the left on social media, it was the ultimate story to spread:
"[T]he boys of Covington Catholic High School ... most of them white, Christian, attendees at the annual March for Life in Washington, and wearers of MAGA hats. What's not to dislike?," asked a Wednesday Wall Street Journal editorial.
So of course, the left's best friends in much of the national media pounced. This story was too juicy to confirm.
Yet the native American man, Nathan Phillips, told two different versions of what happened, wrote New York Times columnist David Brooks. "He told The Washington Post that he was singing a traditional song when the teenagers swarmed around him, some chanting, 'Build that wall, build that wall.'

Texto completo: Sarah Paulson and Holland Taylor's beginning is a very modern love story, the "Glass" actress revealed on the after show for "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen" Wednesday.
Host and expecting dad Cohen asked Paulson how the couple, whose relationship made headlines in 2015, met.
"It's a long story, we met a very, very long time ago," Paulson, 44, said. "I was with someone else, she was too. . . "
Later fate and Twitter stepped in.
"We were doing a thing at Martha Plimpton's house," Paulson remembered. "It was for an organization that she was working with, and we were both doing a little PSA for it, and we sort of breezed by one another. "
Paulson said she and Taylor, 76, then began to follow each other on Twitter.
"Holland Taylor slid into your DMs?" asked fellow guest Billy Eichner.
"She actually did," Paulson confirmed.
"I love that," Cohen responded with glee. "That's awesome. "
Paulson told The New York Times in 2016 that when she first met Taylor she believed her to be "probably the most exquisitely beautiful woman I’d ever seen. "
“There’s a poignancy to being with someone older,” Paulson previously told the Times. “I think there’s a greater appreciation of time and what you have together and what’s important, and it can make the little things seem very small. It puts a kind of sharp light mixed with a sort of diffused light on something. I can’t say it any other way than there’s a poignancy to it, and a heightened sense of time and the value of time. ”
More recently, she addressed their 32-year age gap with Modern Luxury in May.
“If someone wants to spend any time thinking I’m strange for loving the most spectacular person on the planet, then that’s their problem,” she said at the time. “I’m doing just fine. ”

Texto completo: Henry Jamison is on the verge of following Grace Potter and one of his songwriting idols, "Hadestown" creator Anais Mitchell, in the ranks of Vermont-born-and-raised musicians making a big impact on a national scale. The Burlington native's second album, "Gloria Duplex," comes out Feb. 8, after the songs from his 2017 debut, "The Wilds," garnered more than 80 million listens on music-streaming sites. Jamison's super-literate lyrics and intimate vocals have earned attention from National Public Radio and The New York Times, with the latter including Jamison in a Jan. 11 article headlined "The New Angry Young Men: Rockers Who Rail Against 'Toxic Masculinity.'"
"Gloria Duplex" is a concept album of sorts that takes a hard look at the role of men in a #MeToo world. "Part of the point about that, I guess, is if we're addressing that subject, not to treat it in some sort of vacuum," Jamison, 30, told the Free Press last week over a vegetable omelet at Henry's Diner in his hometown of Burlington.
"The first two tracks, 'Gloria' and 'Boys,' are very much like the thesis statement of stuff, sort of saying what i have to say about masculinity very directly," Jamison said. The album's centerpiece is an epic 7-minute-plus track called "Florence Nightingale" that might take years for listeners - Jamison included - to decipher.
"The way that it all holds together, I think that I am happy about it being kind of unclear. It's like I'm lost in all of this, basically," Jamison said of "Florence Nightingale". "I'm very proud of that song because I feel like I got to that a bit, which is sort of stream of consciousness; there's meaning in here, but it's like, 'Here you go,' basically."
Jamison is about to head out on tour in North America and Europe for most of the next three months, including several dates with Guster. Before the start of the tour, the Free Press asked Jamison to take us on another kind of tour, one hitting a trio of spots that meant something to him while growing up in the South End of Burlington.
1. Henry's Diner, Burlington "I came here when I was a kid and I thought to myself, 'My name is Henry and this place is named Henry.' I also had that experience because I used to live one street over from Henry Street. I would walk by and be like, 'It's Henry Street, my name is Henry.' Also, it's like the only diner downtown. I mean, there used to be the Oasis, but I didn't really go there. I guess it's just like I've been here many times over the years. I remember being here with my parents, my brother, some visitors we had. Probably I was like 8 years old."
"More recently, Patrick (McCormack of Essex), my photographer, is a big champion of Henry's Diner. Over the summer we were waking up super-early because we were trying to get fog for the (publicity) photographs. I would wake up at 5 to do that and he would pick me up at, like, 5:30. Then often we would come here. Basically it feels nice. I know there's sort of the hipster takeover of diner culture and that is probably what I'm doing, but I like that it's very simple. You know what's on the menu. The early morning feeling of it, it has this liminal thing in their regulars. I just like to see that going on."
2. Barge Canal/Barge Canal Market, Burlington "I remember my dad coming down here and we looked at the water there. He told me that there was a ton of toxic sludge underneath it. I think it was the first time I ever thought about, I guess, what lies beneath or something. This looks very beautiful but there didn't seem to be much wildlife. There were no birds. It was just kind of this shocking experience of, 'This is not as it seems.' It's beautiful on the surface with this kind of unfortunate industrial problem."
"Back then, the Barge Canal Market was not here. I don't even know what was in here, I guess it was just a warehouse. Myer's Bagels went in there and there's the bookstore Speaking Volumes where I go pretty often. My parents live right up the hill. I like the Barge Canal Market especially, maybe kind of like in the diner way. It's like predictable hipster stuff."
"But also, I really like this German poet (Rainer Maria) Rilke and he talks about things, and he was writing in the early 20th century so he didn't necessarily know totally how horribly awry things would go in terms of things being made by people and having their own special quality. But he saw the trend, which was that the singularity of the thing was being scrubbed out into homogeneity, like art in the age of mechanical reproduction. So I like to come here and just see things like this chair (gestures to simple wooden seat) probably built with much more care than a machine would use, and just things having some story; like, you don't know what the story is, but the story is kind of written into the thing."
3. Red Rocks Park, South Burlington "I've been coming here since I was about 4, probably, even 3. It became a very consistent thing in my life when we got a dog. My dog had lived with a woman who was not well, so she never had really been outside or off the leash or anything. Technically we were not supposed to let her off the leash. My mom especially would bring her here and she would just tear through the woods and we would run around."
"My brother and I had a very rich, imaginative warlike world that we occupied. We would go off the path, there are these little cliffs and stuff, not just the main cliffs that go down to the lake but bigger rock configurations. We were very into 'Lord of the Rings,' especially after the movie came out. I was, like, in eighth grade, older than most people who were doing this kind of thing. We would have sticks and basically pretend to be killing Orcs and stuff."
"Like many things here it was something that I just took for granted and then I was seeing how many cities do not have (this). We grew up quite close to it, it was like a five-minute drive here, and then all of a sudden you're looking out at beautiful view of the lake. If you get into the center of it then it feels pretty wild."

In search of nontoxic manhood

Texto completo: One of the frustrating tics of our society's progressive vanguard is the assumption that every evil it discovers was entirely invisible in the past, that this generation is the first to wrestle with dominance and cruelty.
This forgetting of human experience, this perpetual present-tenseness, pervades the latest flashpoint in the culture war over the sexes - the new guidelines for treating male pathology from the American Psychological Association.
The trouble with men, the guidelines argue, is that they're violent and reckless, far more likely than women to end up in prison or dead before their time. But the deeper problem is they're prisoners of "traditional masculinity," which the guidelines describe as a model of manhood marked by "emotional stoicism, homophobia, not showing vulnerability, self-reliance and competitiveness." This tough-guy ideal encourages "aggression and violence as a means to resolve interpersonal conflict," and tempts men toward rape, drug abuse and suicide.
Are men so tempted? Certainly. The human male is a dangerous figure - generally bigger, stronger and more violent than the female of the species, free from the vulnerability that pregnancy entails, and therefore often distinctively threatening, to women and other men alike.
But the claim that a "traditional masculinity" encompassing "stoicism" and "self-reliance" necessarily makes this problem worse is mostly ahistorical rubbish - not least because in the actual history of the human race "traditional masculinity" as a single coherent category simply does not exist.
To pluck only Western examples, there is no single "traditional" model that can encompass strong, silent types and romantic poets, chivalric knights and laconic cowboys, the sorrowing Young Werther and the stiffened upper lip, the machismo of the Mediterranean and the mysticism of the Celts, Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant and John Wayne.
What actually exists in history, instead, are varying models that attempt to deal with masculinity's dark side in different ways, by channeling, sublimating and containing male aggression. All these models are "traditional" in the sense they were forged in societies more sexist and patriarchal than ours. But they were also forged by cultures well aware of the problem of toxic, reckless, violent men, and very concerned with what to do about them.
Consider, just to pick a reasonably accessible example, the portraits of masculinity offered in the 19th century novel. The toxic bachelor is a fixture in its pages, from Wickham in "Pride and Prejudice" to Vronsky in "Anna Karenina" to Angel Clare in "Tess of the D'Urbervilles." And Victorian novelists both male and female are consistently preoccupied with the question of how a healthier manhood can be embodied.
The stoic model critiqued in the APA guidelines is one attempted embodiment - but only one. There is also the romantic model, who channels lust into romantic idealism, aggression into artistic ambition or religious purpose. And then there is the gentleman, whose persona seeks to balance self-control with idealism, politesse with passion, holding all in synthesis.
The 19th-century canon doesn't imply that a single model always works. In "Far From the Madding Crowd," the hero, Gabriel Oak, is a stoic with a well-integrated romantic streak; his foil and rival for the heroine's affections, William Boldwood, believes himself a stoic but discovers a romanticism he can't control, with violent consequences. In "Pride and Prejudice," Mr. Darcy's gentlemanly self-conception needs the leaven of humility that only romance can provide. 
Then, too, across the life-cycle the models may need to shift - romanticism tempered by stoicism for the young, the reverse for fathers of young children, and some gentlemanly combination in old age.
So every model has limits - but it's folly to blame any or all of them for the pathologies they aspire to tame. Yet that's what contemporary progressivism is constantly inclined to do: Because the male archetypes were forged in more sexist eras, that sexism is regarded as a reason to reject the archetypes tout court, in the hopes of building some sort of New Progressive Man instead.
In overreaction to this rejection, conservatives in the Trump era have ended up defending a caddishness that would make Wickham blush, in the mistaken belief that they're defending masculinity itself. But the New Progressive Man isn't much of a success either: If you listen to liberal women complaining about the male-feminist cads and "soft-boys" in their dating pool, progressive culture seems to have ended up creating a lot of Uriah Heeps and Gilbert Osmonds - men pretending to reject the masculine vices, but really sublimating them into softer forms of exploitation.
The alternative, adapting the older archetypes to an era of greater equality between the sexes, is admittedly a difficult task. But it's a better path than throwing out the older models, and all their wisdom with them, and then cursing Gabriel Oak and Gary Cooper because toxic masculinity hasn't gone away.
Ross Douthat writes for the New York Times. His syndicated column appears on Wednesdays.

Texto completo: Russell Baker, a Baltimore-raised, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, essayist and biographer who hosted the series "Masterpiece Theatre" on PBS and had a long-running column in The New York Times, died at his Leesburg, Va., home Monday, his son said.
The cause of death, which followed a recent fall, was unknown, said son Allen Baker, of New York. His father was 93.
Mr. Baker was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for his commentary and a second in 1982 for his autobiography, "Growing Up," a memoir of his childhood during the Great Depression.
Mr. Baker was as great of a patriarch as he was a writer, Allen Baker said.
"We couldn't have asked for a better father," Allen Baker said Tuesday. "He was a tender and loving man to his family. ... He was just a Regular Joe with an extraordinary job."
Mr. Baker was born Aug. 14, 1925, and graduated from Baltimore City College in 1942. He enrolled at Johns Hopkins University, then put his education on hold to enlist in the Navy in 1943 to serve during World War II.
Mr. Baker completed a bachelor's degree at Hopkins in 1947, his son said. He married the former Miriam Nash, in Baltimore in 1950. The pair had four children; Mrs. Baker predeceased her husband in 2015.
Mr. Baker's journalism career began as a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun in 1947 and 1948, and he made his way to the newspaper's London bureau at age 27.
"His work there caught the eye of James 'Scotty' Reston, then running the New York Times' Washington bureau," The Sun said in a 1999 article. "Bored with reporting, he was given the column in 1962. He was 37."
He was a New York Times columnist until announcing his retirement on Christmas Day 1998 -a 36-year run that made him the longest-running columnist in the history of the paper of record.
"Don't make too much of it," he joked in the 1999 interview with The Sun. "It's only daily journalism."
In addition to his son Allen, Mr. Baker is survived by a sister and three children, Kasia Baker, of Nantucket, Mass.; Michael Baker, of Morrisonville, Va.; and Phyllis Baker, of Morrisonville, Va.; as well as four granddaughters

Maybe We Are Wired To Beat Up Machines

Texto completo: A hitchhiking robot was beheaded in Philadelphia. A security robot was punched to the ground in Silicon Valley. Another security bot, in San Francisco, was covered in a tarp and smeared with barbecue sauce.
Why do people lash out at robots, particularly those that are built to resemble humans? It is a global phenomenon.
In a mall in Osaka, Japan, three boys beat a humanoid robot with all their strength. In Moscow, a man attacked a teaching robot named Alantim with a baseball bat, kicking it to the ground, while the robot pleaded for help.
Why do we act this way? Are we secretly terrified that robots will take our jobs? Upend our societies?
Control our every move with their ever-expanding capabilities and air of quiet malice?
Dark roots
Quite possibly. The specter of insurrection is embedded in the word “robot” itself. It was first used to refer to automatons by Czech playwright Karel Capek, who repurposed a word that had referred to a system of indentured servitude or serfdom. The feudal fear of peasant revolt was transplanted to mechanical servants, and worries of a robot uprising have lingered ever since.
Comedian Aristotle Georgeson has found that videos of people physically aggressing robots are among the most popular he posts on Instagram under the pseudonym Blake Webber.
And much of the feedback he gets tends to reflect the fear of robot uprisings.
Georgeson said some commenters approve of the robot beatings, “saying we should be doing this so they can never rise up. But there’s this whole other group that says we shouldn’t be doing this because when they” - the robots - “see these videos they’re going to be” angry.
But Agnieszka Wykowska, a cognitive neuroscientist and editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Social Robotics, said that while human antagonism toward robots has different forms and motivations, it often resembles the ways that humans hurt each other. Robot abuse, she said, might stem from the tribal psychology of insiders and outsiders.
“You have an agent, the robot, that is in a different category than humans,” she said. “So you probably very easily engage in this psychological mechanism of social ostracism because it’s an out-group member. That’s something to discuss: the dehumanization of robots even though they’re not humans.”
Paradoxically, our tendency to dehumanize robots comes from the instinct to anthropomorphize them. William Santana Li, chief executive of Knightscope, the largest provider of security robots in the United States (two of which were battered in San Francisco), said that while he avoids treating his products as if they were sentient beings, his clients seem unable to help themselves.
“Our clients, a significant majority, end up naming the machines themselves,” he said.
‘Frankenstein
syndrome’
Wykowska said the cruelty that results from this anthropomorphizing might reflect “Frankenstein syndrome,” because “we are afraid of this thing that we don’t really fully understand, because it’s a little bit similar to us, but not quite enough.”
In his paper “Who Is Afraid of the Humanoid?” Frederic Kaplan, digital humanities chairman at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland, suggested that Westerners have been taught to see themselves as biologically informed machines - and perhaps, are unable to separate the idea of humanity from a vision of machines. The nervous system could only be understood after the discovery of electricity, he wrote.
DNA is necessarily explained as an analog to computer code. And the human heart is often understood as a mechanical pump. At every turn, Kaplan wrote, “we see ourselves in the mirror of the machines that we can build.”
This does not explain human destruction of less humanoid machines.
Dozens of vigilantes have thrown rocks at driverless cars in Arizona, for example, and incident reports from San Francisco suggest that human drivers are intentionally crashing into driverless cars.
These robot altercations may have more to do with fear of unemployment, or with vengeance: A paper published last year by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University suggested that each robot that is added to a discreet zone of economic activity “reduces employment by about six workers.” Blue-collar occupations were particularly hit hard.
And a self-driving car killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in March, which at least one man, brandishing a rifle, cited as the reason for his dislike of the machines.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reaffirms that Democrats won’t negotiate with President Donald Trump without first opening the government.
How to negotiate a compromise on border security
By Raphael Lapin
As of Tuesday, the government shutdown entered its second month. The principals in the dispute, President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have dug their heels into their rigid positions to the extent that any compromise on either side will be costly in terms of both ego and political standing.
When faced with a seemingly unyielding impasse, good negotiators will deploy various techniques in an attempt to break the impasse. For example, a change of the negotiators at the table can sometimes introduce fresh insights and perspectives. But due to the very partisan nature of this shutdown dispute and the appeal of public recognition, that's not very likely.
Trump's negotiation style, both in office and before, appears to be highly positional, adversarial and uncompromising, with subtle use of intimidation. This might have worked well for him in business, where he was usually in a position of power, but it is less effective in a position with checks and balances.

Pelosi, on the other hand, is also positional and uncompromising. A skilled negotiator, however, could break through a counterpart's ineffective style by leading with a constructive process, thereby changing the game.
A technique that skilled negotiators use, which I'm amazed Pelosi hasn't tried, is to change the conversation and reframe the negotiation problem that needs to be resolved.
The two polarized positions in this dispute is wall versus no wall. The dispute must be reframed if any agreement is to be reached. Perhaps rather than arguing over the wall, engaging in a dialogue about improved, enhanced and even optimized border security would be more constructive. All sides can agree on the need for strong border security. Each side may define "strong border security" differently, but at least the discussion can start from a point of general agreement.
The conversation should then center on negotiating common standards and measurable benchmarks that both sides agree would constitute "strong border security. " Once consensus on mutually acceptable strong border security standards and benchmarks has been reached, the parties must then negotiate how best to achieve those quantifiable benchmarks and to monitor them, whether by way of a wall, some other creative and innovative means, or combinations of both.
Reframing the issue might lower the adversarial nature of this dispute, while broadening the range of options without either side compromising its overarching interest of strong border security.
This approach, however, would require Trump and Pelosi to recraft their message. Their open statements (or tweets) should no longer focus on a wall but convey the message of working toward strong border security. That way, when a solution is finally found, both can claim victory in that the strong border security has been achieved.

What others are saying
Tyler Cowen, Bloomberg: "The real power here is held by government employees, especially those in critical jobs. Let’s say that more Transportation Security Administration screeners decided to walk off the job. It’s already the case that the TSA absentee rate has gone up to 10 percent, from 3. 1 percent a year ago. It is possible to imagine screeners staying home in much greater numbers, thus crippling the entire nation. That could either force President Donald Trump’s hand or lead to a congressional override of a potential presidential veto. "
Rush Limbaugh, The Rush Limbaugh Show: "I actually, folks, really believe that if (the president) hangs on and continues down this road, at some point there’s gonna be a shift in public opinion and the vast majority of the American people are gonna end up with him on this — if he hangs in there. . . . This is exactly what we’ve wanted: The de-emphasis of government, the shrinking of government, the illustration of the (pfft!) redundancy in the number of people and policies and so forth. The idea that people can function, that their lives can go on even in the midst of a partial government shutdown. "
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "Imagine if there were a progressive movement strong enough to pressure Trump by highlighting the damage he is doing. What could that look like? Among other things, it could look like a nationwide one-day strike by federal workers. With even a minority of them participating, it would create huge logistical problems at airports and elsewhere. . . . The threat of future strikes would be clear. The human effects of the shutdown would no longer be so easy for the country to ignore. Yes, strikes by federal workers are illegal. But requiring people to work without pay may also be illegal, legal scholars have pointed out. Either way, protest movements often use illegal tactics. "
What our readers are saying
Government shutdowns have been the norm for many years. If you are a government employee who doesn't make the "critical" list, then you should be prepared for these periods. The good news is that you will get paid when the people posturing on both sides get their act together and actually work with each other. But if you don't have a rainy day fund, that is your fault, not the government's.
— Douglas Watson
How can anyone accept to come in to work with no pay at the end of the week? No law can force you to do that. Why help the people (on both sides of the aisle) who put you out of a paying job?
— Dan Peters
The shutdown might end if the Senate Republicans meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and persuade him to let them vote to end the shutdown. Then, Congress should create a law that prevents this type of nonsense from disrupting America ever again. No single issue, like this petty wall, should ever be used as a way to hurt all of America.
— Gary Frank
The takeaway here is that most of the representatives are acting like grownups and that the big four (President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer) are acting like impetuous, spoiled children.
— Tanya Louise Allen

Christie abandons 'friend' Rep. King

Texto completo: It was a question that jumped out at me as I read the itinerary for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's trip to Iowa in October 2014.
Why on earth would Christie, who was laying the groundwork for a 2016 presidential campaign as an establishment candidate, headline a fundraiser for Republican Rep. Steve King, an unapologetic extremist who had a knack of grabbing national headlines with his incendiary taunts of minority groups?
It didn't seem like the company that a careful political operative like Christie would keep. After all, Christie's disciplined courtship of Hispanic voters a year earlier contributed to his reelection landslide.
It was a question that gnawed at me enough to take a 41/2-hour ride from Des Moines with another New Jersey reporter to the rural Hole in the Wall hunting lodge in the northwestern corner of the state near the South Dakota border.
As the two politicians stepped onto the porch, I asked Christie if he was concerned that all his hard work cultivating Hispanic support back home might be jeopardized by his supporting the inflammatory King. A year earlier, King made headlines with his demeaning depiction of Mexican teens who developed "calves the size of cantaloupes" from hauling heavy loads of marijuana into the country.
King, dressed in boots and camouflage hunting gear, sharply interrupted my questioning by asking me if I had proof or a tape of his comments. I didn't have them with me, but they had been widely reported. King's tactic succeeded in putting me momentarily on my heels. Christie, meanwhile, refused to put any distance between himself and King.
"No, he's a friend. I don't back away from that for an inch, nor should I, nor has he given me any reason to," Christie replied. "I will be a supporter of Steve King for as long as he continues to be in public life."
Christie apparently had a dramatic change of heart Wednesday, joining a growing national chorus of condemnation over King's most recent inflammatory remarks in The New York Times, in which he said: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
The House overwhelmingly passed a resolution Tuesday condemning King's remarks, a symbolic but rare reprimand. House Republicans also stripped him of his committee assignments, which will leave him little room to wield power in Congress.
Republicans from across the ideological divide — ranging from moderates like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney to New Jersey's conservative state Sen. Joe Pennacchio, R-Morris — have condemned King's remarks this past week. The drumbeat calling on King to resign has intensified, but Christie didn't go that far.
The public outrage from Christie and the rest of the GOP is hypocrisy. King's white nationalist tendencies and race-baiting remarks had been well-documented long before that New York Times interview and certainly known to Christie that day at the hunting lodge.
The GOP was willing to look the other way as long as King was useful. Christie was not the only Republican contender who sought his blessing in the 2016 Iowa caucus. Even Iowa's U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley described him as an "ally" during his reelection race last year.
So why the sudden about-face?
For one thing, the shellacking that Republicans endured in the 2018 midterms has stirred panic in the GOP ranks. Women and moderates in vote-rich suburbs abandoned the party in droves, revolted by President Donald Trump's embrace of white nationalism and harsh, anti-immigrant rhetoric. Even King, who had racked up hefty victory margins since entering Congress in 2003, squeaked by with a 3-point victory over his Democratic challenger last year.
Republicans fear that Trump's brand will permanently become the party's brand. Yet many are in a bind: While they know Trump is the problem, few are willing to publicly confront him. They fear that Trump will retaliate in a nasty Twitter storm, and set his hard-core loyalists against them in a primary.
As a result, King serves as a convenient stand-in, somebody for worried Republicans to criticize without fear of antagonizing Trump — who, by the way, has refused to defend King even though King's early advocacy of a wall on the southern border with Mexico served as an inspiration to Trump.
"This has nothing to do with Steven King," said Larry Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist, referring to the GOP outrage. "They are using King as a vehicle to send a message to Donald Trump."
Christie's relationship with King was fueled by political expediency and loyalty.
The alliance with King began in June 2009, when Christie, a candidate for governor, came under scrutiny for awarding lucrative contracts to private lawyers to oversee court settlements during his seven-year stint as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey.
Some of the work had gone to politically connected allies, including a deal worth as much as $52 million to former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, Christie's onetime boss at the Justice Department. A House committee investigating these so-called monitor contracts summoned Christie to testify.
King ran interference for Christie when the hearing got testy. He took aim at U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee who was grilling Christie. "Mr. Christie is part of the future leadership in this country, and hopefully this [hearing] will enhance his ability to contribute to American society," King said at one point.
That day on the porch in 2014, Christie repaid the favor, minimizing remarks and describing King as someone like himself, who sometimes gets in trouble for saying controversial things.
"I'm sure there are things I've said over time that Steve hasn't agreed with, and there's things that he's said that I may not agree with the way he said, or the way I said it," Christie said. "One of the things Steve and I share is an absolute commitment to speaking our mind."
Christie is no longer running for public office, but it's clear that he wants to maintain a role as a well-compensated party elder, dispensing wisdom on cable TV and in speeches before Republican audiences. So, perhaps, it was time for him discard his relationship with King.
Christie did not return a call seeking comment. He does have a tell-all book coming out this month. It will be interesting to see if he devotes any discussion to his relationship with his outspoken — and now former — friend from Iowa.

For Martin Luther King Jr. Day: 3 stories and a letter

Texto completo: Our topic for today: three stories and a letter.
The stories all made recent headlines. The first was about the state of Florida posthumously pardoning the Groveland Four, a group of African-American men who suffered torture, prison and murder after being falsely accused of raping a white woman in 1949.
The second concerns broad Republican condemnation of one of their own, Rep. Steve King, for an interview with The New York Times in which he questioned why the terms "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" should be considered offensive.
The third involves a directive -- since rescinded -- that NBC News sent its writers, reporters and anchors about King's words. "Be careful to avoid characterizing (King's) remarks as racist," it said, suggesting that the remarks instead be described as "what many are calling 'racist.'"
As for the letter: It was written by Martin Luther King Jr., whose 90th birthday the nation commemorates Monday. King famously penned the epistle from a jail cell in Birmingham in response to a group of white clergymen, eight moderate, principled men, who had condemned as "unwise and untimely" his demonstrations against segregation in their city.
One passage of King's response seems especially apropos to this moment. In it, he confessed that he had become "gravely disappointed with the white moderate." Too often, he said, they were "more devoted to 'order' than to justice" and preferred "a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice."
Added King: "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will."
Make no mistake: King well knew that all over the South, liberal white kids were risking their lives for black freedom. He was calling out other white people, often older, more moderate white people like those eight men, for the tepidness and flaccidity of their commitment to racial reconciliation. This was 1963, but as the stories above suggest, that problem endures.
It is possible, for instance, to celebrate that Florida has finally done right by the Groveland Four -- and yet to also be disgusted that it takes 70 years for the state to belatedly admit its crimes and deliver some small measure of delayed "justice."
It is possible to consider the GOP's condemnation of Steve King all well and fine, yet also a little arbitrary and affected given that King has a history of racist rhetoric that passed without his party seeming to much notice or care -- and that the GOP itself has a long record of thinly veiled racism as obvious as the writing on Barack Obama's birth certificate.
It is possible to concede that NBC has an interest in ensuring its people remain disinterested observers of events they report, yet feel that in asking them to refrain from calling obvious racism obvious racism, the network doesn't embody journalistic rigor so much as it does white peoples' too-frequent refusal to call out such racism even when it's right in front of them.
We may safely assume most NBC executives, Republican lawmakers and Florida officials would say -- and probably believe -- all the right things if you asked about their commitment to racial justice. Yet given a chance to put force behind that commitment, they failed. In Florida's case, they failed for seven decades.
"The ultimate tragedy," King once said, "is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." He was right.
If you are good, yet silent, maybe you're not really as good as you think.

The Data Market: 'Like a Form of Derivative.'

Texto completo: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news , offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here .
Greetings, I'm Natasha Singer, your resident privacy reporter. And I'm writing to you from wintry New York City as the government shutdown increases financial pressure on federal workers and the tech elites jet off to Davos, Switzerland, to hobnob at the World Economic Forum.
For the last few years, the forum has been heralding the "Fourth Industrial Revolution." That's the idea that today's digital innovations are generating entire new industries -- in much the way electricity enabled the mass production of the Model T Ford in the early 20th century.
But a provocative new book, "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism," by Shoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at the Harvard Business School, offers a more sobering counternarrative.
Published on Tuesday, the book argues that digital services developed by the likes of Google and Facebook should not be viewed as the latest iteration of industrialization. Instead, Dr. Zuboff writes, they represent a new and problematic market form that trades in predicting and influencing human behavior.
"Surveillance capitalism has taken human experience, specifically private human experience, and unilaterally claimed it as something to be bought and sold in the marketplace," Dr. Zuboff told me during a visit to The Times's office. "This new kind of marketplace trades in behavioral futures. It's like a form of derivative. But it's about us."
Yet most of us are not aware that platforms like Google and Facebook may track and analyze our every search, location, like, video, photo, post and punctuation mark the better to try to sway us, she said.
In fact, a new study on Facebook from the Pew Research Center illustrates how opaque this behavior marketplace can be to consumers.
The study, my colleague Sapna Maheswari writes, reported that about three-fourths of Facebook users were unaware that the social network maintained lists of their personal interests, such as their political leanings, for advertisers. And about half of users who looked at their "ad preferences" -- the Facebook pages displaying these details -- said they were uncomfortable with the company's creating lists of categories about them.

The technologies that power the behavior speculation market, of course, have spread far beyond online ads.
They enable auto insurers to surveil drivers and offer discounts based on their driving performance. They allow workplace wellness programs to charge higher health insurance premiums to employees who decline to wear fitness trackers. They helped Kremlin-linked groups mount political influence campaigns on Facebook (although, as my colleague John Herrman pointed out this past week, we have yet to learn how effective those campaigns were).
The flash-trading in human behavioral data was not inevitable.
In her book, Dr. Zuboff describes how Google, in its early days, used the keywords that people typed in to improve its search engine even as it paid scant attention to the collateral data -- like users' keyword phrasing, click patterns and spellings -- that came with it. Pretty soon, however, Google began harvesting this surplus information, along with other details like users' web-browsing activities, to infer their interests and target them with ads.
The model was later adopted by Facebook.
The companies' pivot -- from serving to surveilling their users -- pushed Google and Facebook to harvest more and more data, Dr. Zuboff writes. In doing so, the companies sometimes bypassed privacy settings or made it difficult for users to opt out of data-sharing.
"We saw these digital services were free, and we thought, you know, 'We're making a reasonable trade-off with giving them valuable data,"' Dr. Zuboff told me. "But now that's reversed. They've decided that we're free, that they can take our experience for free and translate it into behavioral data. And so we are just the source of raw material."
Of course, tech companies tend to bristle at the word "surveillance." They associate it with government spying on individuals -- not with their own snooping on users and trying to sway them at scale.
"When organizations do surveillance, people don't have control over that," Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief, said in April during a Senate hearing on Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling company that improperly harvested the data of millions of Facebook users. "But on Facebook, everything that you share, you have control over."
Surveillance, however, simply means observation or supervision, often with the intent of channeling the surveilled in a particular direction. As Dr. Zuboff's book points out, that is at the core of Facebook's panopticon of a business model.
In other news:
■ Microsoft pledged nearly $500 million in loans to help build affordable housing in the Seattle area. The money is "the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread" in its backyard, Karen Weise writes.
■ Facebook is facing continued pressure to more aggressively counter the spread of divisive disinformation and user manipulation on its platform, Adam Satariano writes. The company said Thursday that it had identified two new Russian-linked misinformation campaigns. "Up to 1,200 people expressed interest in attending one of the roughly 190 events organized by those behind the fake pages," the article notes. "Facebook couldn't say whether any of the events had taken place."
■ Legislators must find a new way to regulate social media, Natasha Tusikov, a criminology professor, and Blayne Haggart, a political-science professor, argue in The Conversation. One suggestion, they write: "It's time to consider noncommercial ownership of social-media entities -- including nonprofit or some form of public ownership."
■ And finally, how might countries grapple with a global labor market in which there are few protections for many digital workers? Read the opinion piece in the New Statesman by Mark Graham, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute.

Texto completo: Just as Mayor de Blasio tries one last time to offer himself as a potential progressive presidential candidate to a so-far uninterested nation, out came the New York Times with a devastating report on how a sexual harasser was allowed to quietly see himself out of City Hall early last year.
That was acting Chief of Staff Kevin O'Brien, who left with no announcement or explanation shortly after de Blasio won reelection, and amid #MeToo calls for the city to account for its own handling of sexual harassment claims. (When those numbers came out later that year, the mayor initially pointed to a "hyper-complaint dynamic" at the Education Department to account for 500 claims there on his watch, with just seven of them substantiated.)
Back to O'Brien. The legal department's termination recommendation after substantiating two complaints of sexual harassment was dated Feb. 13, 2018, according to the documents obtained by reporter William Neuman. O'Brien's resignation was dated March 23, as was his final paycheck.
"The misconduct in this case literally makes me sick to my stomach," de Blasio said as he acknowledged it for the first time this week, nearly a year later. He called himself "livid," "disgusted" and "deeply disappointed" with O'Brien, and "deeply sorry" for the two women.
City Hall had let O'Brien leave quietly, and after drawing his salary of more than $200,000 a year for another five weeks, to protect the privacy of the two women, de Blasio said.
Mostly, the mayor stressed that the buck stops with, well, First Assistant Corporation Counsel Georgia Pestana, the city lawyer who'd dealt with O'Brien's case.
"There are things that I do not have detail on in this case," the mayor said, "and that was done on purpose." Later, he repeated that "the decision was made by one of the top lawyers for the city who personally handled this case and believed it was the right thing to do."
After the right thing was done, O'Brien landed at Hilltop, the consulting and lobbying firm founded and run by Nick Baldick, the ally whom de Blasio had previously claimed was an "agent of the city" and who'd recommended O'Brien to City Hall in the first place.
In what might be an echo of how City Hall let him appear to leave of his accord, Hilltop told the Times Wednesday that O'Brien had taken a leave of absence. Baldick told the Times Thursday that he'd been fired.
"There's no excuse for what I've done; I'm embarrassed and ashamed," O'Brien said in a written statement, adding that "(m)y use of alcohol has led me to make horrible decisions" and that he was getting "professional help."
Shame aside, O'Brien paid little apparent price for his horrible decisions until the Times story appeared. In hiding their reasons for pushing out the perpetrator, as a News editorial put it on Friday, City Hall put others unknowingly in his path.
The real issue, said de Blasio, speaking in circles, is that Hilltop hadn't called for a reference. If only they had called, he said, they would have heard that O'Brien - who, again, had been recommended to City Hall by the firm's founder - had been allowed to resign in lieu of termination. "Any proactive outreach ran the risk of breaking the confidentiality (of the women)," de Blasio said. Huh.
The guy teasing his presidential aspirations by refusing to answer hypotheticals sure doesn't mind dishing them out. And he's had too many elaborate, I-know-this-sounds-crazy-but stories to keep receiving the benefit of the doubt from New Yorkers.
Next month, a joint session of the state Legislature will hold an overdue hearing on sexual harassment. It's a shame that just as Albany moves toward letting sunlight in, City Hall is working to keep us in the dark.

Bolton steering trump to war?

Texto completo: "Stop the ENDLESS WARS!" implored President Donald Trump in a Jan. 13 tweet.
Well, if he is serious, Trump had best keep an eye on his national security adviser, for a U.S. war on Iran would be a dream come true for John Bolton.
Last September, when Shiite militants launched three mortar shells into the Green Zone in Baghdad, which exploded harmlessly in a vacant lot, Bolton called a series of emergency meetings and directed the Pentagon to prepare a menu of targets, inside Iran, for U.S. air and missile strikes in retaliation.
The Wall Street Journal quoted one U.S. official as saying Bolton's behavior "rattled people. ... People were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran."
Bolton's former deputy, Mira Ricardel, reportedly told a gathering the shelling into the Green Zone was "an act of war" to which the U.S. must respond decisively.
Bolton has long believed a U.S. confrontation with Iran is both inevitable and desirable. In 2015, he authored a New York Times op-ed whose title, "To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran," said it all. He has urged that "regime change" in Iran be made a declared goal of U.S. foreign policy. When Trump announced his decision to withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troops now in Syria, Bolton swiftly imposed conditions: ISIS must first be eliminated, Iranian forces and allied militias must leave, and the Kurds must be protected. Yet enforcing such red lines would require a permanent presence of American troops. For how, without war, would we effect the removal of Bashar Assad's Iranian allies, if he declines to expel them and the Iranians refuse to go?
Bolton has an ally in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In Cairo last week, Pompeo declared it U.S. policy "to expel every last Iranian boot" from Syria.
And though Hezbollah has been a "major presence" in Lebanon for several decades, "we won't accept this as the status quo," said Pompeo, for Hezbollah is a "wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian regime."
But how does the secretary of state propose to push Hezbollah out of Lebanon peacefully when the Israelis could not do it in a monthlong war in 2006?
Pompeo's purpose during his tour of the Middle East? Build a new Middle East Strategic Alliance, a MESA, an Arab NATO, whose members are to be Egypt, Jordan and the nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council. There are other signs a confrontation is coming soon. The U.S. has objected to Iran's pending launch of two space satellites, saying these look like tests of missiles designed to deliver nuclear warheads. Yet Iran has never produced weapons-grade uranium or plutonium and never tested an ICBM. Pompeo has also called for a conclave in Poland in February to bring together an anti-Iran alliance to discuss what is to be done about what he calls "our common enemy."
Over the weekend, Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu boasted of Israel's latest strike in Syria: "Just in the last 36 hours, the air force attacked Iranian warehouses with Iranian weapons at the international airport in Damascus. The accumulation of recent attacks proves that we are determined more than ever to take action against Iran in Syria, just as we promised."
Israel brags that it has hit 200 targets inside Syria in recent years. The boasting may be connected to Bibi's desire to strengthen his credentials as a security hawk for the coming Israeli election. But it is also a provocation to the Iranians and Syrians to retaliate, which could ignite a wider war between Israel and Syrian and Iranian forces.
What does the U.S. think of the Israeli strikes? Said Pompeo: "We strongly support Israel's efforts to stop Iran from turning Syria into the next Lebanon."
In short, forces are moving in this country and in Israel to bring about a U.S. confrontation with Iran - before our troops leave Syria.
But the real questions here are not about Bolton or Pompeo.
They are about Trump. Was he aware of Bolton's request for a menu of targets in Iran for potential U.S. strikes? Did he authorize it? Has he authorized his national security adviser and secretary of state to engage in these hostile actions and bellicose rhetoric aimed at Iran? And if so, why? While Trump has urged that the U.S. pull out of these Mideast wars, Pompeo has corrected him, "When America retreats, chaos often follows."
One thing may confidently be said of the rhetoric and actions of Bolton and Pompeo: This is not what brought out the new populists who made Donald Trump president, the people who still share his desire to "stop the endless wars."

Texto completo: How members of Congress from Hampton Roads voted on major bills for the week ending Jan. 18. NV means Not Voting.

HOUSE VOTES
Sanctions relief for Russian companies
For, 362; Against, 53
The House on Jan. 17 passed a measure (HJ Res 30) that would prevent the Treasury Department from lifting economic sanctions on aluminum and energy companies controlled by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the Senate (below) voted to clear the way for Treasury to grant sanctions relief starting this month in return for Deripaska relinquishing majority stakes in the three firms. U.S. sanctions on his personal assets are to remain in force.
A yes vote was to retain sanctions on the Deripaska-controlled companies.
Wittman (R-Westmoreland) Y
Luria (D-Virginia Beach) Y
McEachin (D-Henrico) NV
Scott (D-Newport News) Y

Disapproval of racist comments
For, 424; Against, 1
The House on Jan. 15 adopted a resolution (H Res 41) disapproving of comments by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, extolling white nationalism and supremacy. He said in a New York Times interview published Jan. 10: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" The vote occurred the day after House Republican leaders stripped the eight-term congressman from northwestern Iowa of his committee assignments.
A yes vote was to adopt the resolution.
Wittman (R-Westmoreland) Y
Luria (D-Virginia Beach) Y
McEachin (D-Henrico) Y
Scott (D-Newport News) Y

$12.1B for disaster relief
For, 237; Against, 187
The House on Jan. 16 passed a bill (HR 268) that would provide $12.1 billion to homeowners, businesses, farmers, local governments and other entities harmed by wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, mudslides, volcanic eruptions and typhoons in the United States and its territories in recent years. The bill drew Republican opposition because of its language to reopen closed parts of the government through Feb. 8 without providing border-wall funding requested by President Trump. The disaster aid includes $2.96 billion for rebuilding infrastructure; $2.54 billion for mitigating damages in future disasters; $1.86 billion for farmers and rural communities; $1.16 billion for community-development grants and $555 million to fund social services for displaced persons, among other outlays.
A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.
Wittman (R-Westmoreland) N
Luria (D-Virginia Beach) Y
McEachin (D-Henrico) Y
Scott (D-Newport News) Y

Prohibition on wall funding
For, 230; Against, 197
The House on Jan.16 voted to prohibit the department of Homeland Security or Army Corps of Engineers from spending any funds in a disaster relief bill (HR 268, above) to plan, develop or build President Donald Trump's proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. The amendment was introduced after Trump said he might use previously appropriated but not yet spent disaster aid to build the wall.
A yes vote was to adopt the amendment.
Wittman (R-Westmoreland) N
Luria (D-Virginia Beach) Y
McEachin (D-Henrico) NV
Scott (D-Newport News) Y

Clean bill on disaster relief
For, 193; Against, 231
The House on Jan. 16 defeated a GOP effort to reshape HR 268 (above) as a bill dealing only with disaster relief. The motion sought to strip the bill of a "continuing resolution" that would reopen the government at least through Feb. 8 but disregard President Trump's request for border-wall funding. Republicans called the wall rebuff a "poison pill" they could not accept.
A yes vote was to produce a bill dealing only with disaster aid.
Wittman (R-Westmoreland) Y
Luria (D-Virginia Beach) N
McEachin (D-Henrico) N
Scott (D-Newport News) N

SENATE VOTES
Sanctions relief for Russian companies
For, 57; Against, 42
The Senate on Jan. 16 failed to reach 60 votes needed to advance a Democratic-sponsored measure (SJ Res 2) that sought to retain U.S. economic sanctions on the corporate domain of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. This upheld a deal soon to take effect in which the Treasury Department will remove the sanctions in return for Deripaska giving up majority interests in three firms he controls. In addition, the vote rendered as symbolic a House move (above) to nullify the sanctions deal. Deripaska is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and onetime business associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
A yes vote was to block Russian sanctions relief.
Kaine (D) Y
Warner (D) Y

Affordable Care Act abortion funding
For, 48; Against, 47
The Senate on Jan 17 failed to reach 60 votes needed to advance a Republican-sponsored bill (S 109) that would prohibit federal subsidies of insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act exchanges that provide abortion coverage. The bill would nullify the existing requirement that ACA policyholders personally pay the share of their insurance premium that reflects coverage of reproductive services. The health law is covered by the so-called Hyde Amendment, a standard part of annual appropriations bills that prohibits the expenditure of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the mother.
A yes vote was to advance the bill.
Kaine (D) N
Warner (D) N

Key Votes Ahead
The House will take up government-funding measures in the week of Jan. 21, while the Senate will consider a bill authorizing military aid to Israel.

Representatives are:
Rep. Robert J. Wittman (R-Westmoreland), Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Virginia Beach), Rep.Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) and Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott (D-Newport News).

Senators are:
Sen. Mark R. Warner (D) and Sen. Tim Kaine (D).

Remembering the 'Rent' They Lived

Texto completo: As live television productions of classic Broadway musicals turn to more contemporary fare, some original creators have the chance to get involved. So it will be with "Rent," which airs on Jan. 27 on Fox and is co-directed by Michael Greif, who oversaw the pathbreaking show's premiere at New York Theater Workshop, then on Broadway.
Jonathan Larson's 1996 musical, about Lower East Side artists living in the shadow of AIDS, was immortalized when its creator died of an aortic aneurysm just before its opening night Off Broadway.
Sara Krulwich, the theater photographer for The New York Times, had unusual access to the cast and creators in the wake of that tragedy, as well as in subsequent triumphs, following "Rent" to Broadway, a Pulitzer Prize and a national tour.
In anticipation of the television version (which stars Tinashe, Vanessa Hudgens and Brandon Victor Dixon), The Times reached out to the subjects featured in Ms. Krulwich's early photographs. Most of the images haven't been published, and depicted in many of them are behind-the-scenes players, now-acclaimed Broadway stars and aspiring performers who never made it into the show.
Here they describe what the pictures conveyed, then and now, after so many seasons of love.
Idina Menzel
Opening night excitement with the traditional "Gypsy Robe" worn by Gwen, whose solo was our musical compass every night. This was my first dressing room on Broadway, which I shared with my sister Daphne Rubin-Vega. The joy on my face was the realization that we were a part of something very special.
Michael Greif
The original concept for the signature wall was that celebrities would be brought back and asked to sign. After those first previews, I'd watch friends and family watch those celebrities sign the wall while we all waited in the alley. It seemed wrong, contrary to the spirit of the show, that there was some sort of dividing line between those who could and couldn't tell the company and Jonathan what they felt. So one night, during the second act, I wrote, "I teach 7th grade English, I hope all my students will come see this show" and signed a fake name. That night, EVERYONE in the alley signed the wall, and it was like that ever after.
Adam Pascal
I think this is a moment of pure disbelief. I'm sure I had no idea what winning the Pulitzer Prize even meant.
Christina Cabot
I'd not thought of that day since, well, likely that day, and yet now I remember it like it was a hell of a lot more recent than 22 years ago! Funnily enough, meditation was only ever (and only continues to be) a part of my life when connected to acting preparation. For many years now, I've worked as an acting coach both on set and privately, and I always try to impress upon students that gaining an authentic understanding of what it feels like to be being grounded and centered and self-possessed is as important as knowing what it means to break down a scene or walk in a particular character's shoes.
It will be so interesting to see how this 2019 incarnation shakes out. So, so many things are radically different about our world today. I truly hope it resonates with kids today as it did with my generation.
P.S.: I didn't book the gig, but that probably owes less to meditation and more to the fact that I can't belt above middle G!
Julie Larson
My brother Jonathan and I were extremely close. As children, we always watched the Tony Awards. He even practiced acceptance speeches in our living room for the awards he one day hoped to win. I dislike public speaking; however, I believed I knew what he would want to say and it was important to me to be the one to convey his message. I told myself that if I were called up to the stage, I could handle my own discomfort because it meant that he'd won a Tony and realized his dream.
Bernard Telsey
"Rent" was the first Broadway musical I cast. We spent months and months in auditions and couldn't find anyone for any role until the days each of the original cast walked in. Once it became clear that the run might not have an end date -- and if it did, it was far away -- we saw over 4,000 people at the first Broadway open call. We started creating binders to track everyone who had come in to audition for the show as a reference guide. We started with four binders, and by the time "Rent" closed on Broadway, we had over 60 binders full of schedules, headshots and resumes.
Working on "Rent Live" was an exciting way to return to that original search -- not caring about names or celebrity, just looking for raw talent.

Texto completo: SUNDAY BUSINESS
An article in last Sunday's special section on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds about the investing strategies of three mutual funds that outperformed the market in the fourth quarter of 2018 misstated the process for allocating the assets of the MFS Diversified Income Fund. The fund starts with allocations of 25 percent of assets to high-yield bonds and 15 percent to emerging-markets bonds, not with allocations of 20 percent to both those categories.
TRAVEL
An article last Sunday about Puglia, Italy, as part of the 52 Places to Go in 2019 misstated who has been attracted to the region and its winemaking. It is the Antinori family, which operates the Tormaresca bistro in Lecce, not the owners of the London restaurant Bocca di Lupo.
An article on Jan. 6 about Jada Yuan's experiences traveling the world for The New York Times described incorrectly the status of Puerto Rico. It is a territory of the United States; it is not its own country.
An article on Dec. 23 about hotels that have music events planned this year misstated who will be promoting the Beat Hotel festival in Marrakesh. The promoters are the group behind the Beat Hotel at Glastonbury, England, festival, not the promoters of the entire Glastonbury festival.
The 36 Hours column on Nov. 25, about Denver, referred incorrectly to the train line connecting downtown to the airport. It is a commuter line, not a light-rail line. This correction was delayed because it was only recently brought to the editor's attention.
BOOK REVIEW
A review on Dec. 30 about "Tell Them of Battles, Kings, and Elephants," by Mathias Énard, describedincorrectly the terminal points of a bridge in that novel. Michelangelo designs the bridge to cross the Golden Horn in Constantinople; it is not "a bridge that will join Asia to Europe." The review also misspelled the surname of the book's translator; she is Charlotte Mandell, not Mandel. These errors were repeated in the Editors' Choice column on Jan. 6.
MAGAZINE
The Eat column in the Jan. 6 issue, about barbecue-chicken pizza, misidentified the book written by Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfi eld from which a recipe was adapted. It is "The California Pizza Kitchen Cookbook," not "The California Pizza Chicken Cookbook."

Texto completo: There once was a woman named Bindy
who comes from the city that's windy ...
Bindy Bitterman, a Chicago-area woman in her 80s, recently emailed me to ask what I thought of limericks. I am a fan, as is Bitterman, who subsequently sent me a smattering of the limericks she writes for children. It's a collection she hopes will one day interest a publisher, and one that took me back to my own childhood when limericks were a staple of my learning how to write.
Hopefully, we're all familiar with the form, but here's a quick refresher: Each stanza of a limerick has five lines. The first, second and fifth lines rhyme and are generally written in an anapestic meter of unstressed then stressed syllables: ba DUM, ba ba DUM, ba ba DUM.
There once was a man from Nantucket ...
One of my school limericks has been preserved for the ages in my fifth-grade writing portfolio, inexplicably preserved by mother Biblioracle.
Once there was a man named Joe
Who had a girlfriend named Flo
They went to a game
Where Joe picked up a dame
And that was the end of Flo
Clearly not my best work, but it illustrates something young people should be learning about writing -- namely, that there is a music to prose, and developing an ear for that music is part of a well-rounded reader's (and writer's) abilities. My stretch for "dame," a word I don't think I'd used before (or since) is me trying to solve a writing problem, and solving writing problems is how we learn to write.
Bitterman turned to the limerick after 48 years of marriage, raising four kids, assisting with her husband's custom jewelry business and running an antique store. A onetime English major at Northwestern and lover of doggerel verse of all types, after her retirement and her husband's death several years ago, she was "fixed up on a date" with a man who was a member of The Society of the Fifth Line, an all-male group dedicated to limericks that stretch into R- and even X-rated territory.
Bitterman was more interested in writing for children and has found great pleasure in solving the problem of writing a good limerick. She's inspired by something that "tickles" her and then goes searching for rhymes, the sillier the better. Bitterman works at ahigher degree of limerick difficulty, crafting three related five-line stanzas for each poem.
I'm wondering if limericks are the fountain of youth. In addition to the delightful Bindy Bitterman, consider Larry Eisenberg, recently eulogized in The New York Times after dying at age 99, who was best known for posting comments on news articles written in the form of limericks. Eisenberg had posted more than 13,000 comments to The Times since 2008.
If you're confused about how a limerick should look and sound, Bitterman will show us the way.

How to read -- and maybe write -- a limerick
By Bindy Bitterman
There was a young lady named Pearl
Who lived all her life in a whirl
She would go out for sports
In her tee shirt and shorts
And the audience cried, "Atta girl!"
Now, read this next verse just like that:
Your voice should be lilting, not flat.
The middle, you see,
Could rhyme a, b, c, d,
But the last line?
Sat, rat, fat or bat!
What's hard is to do a good rhyme
(Tho you can do something silly, like I'm!)
If you stick to the patter
That makes it all matter
You're a limerick writer, big time!

Book recommendations from The Biblioracle
John Warner tells you what to read based on the last five books you've read.

1. "Autumn" by Karl Ove Knausgaard
2. "True Grit" by Charles Portis
3. "An Absolutely Remarkable Thing" by Hank Green
4. "The Last Equation of Isaac Severy: A Novel in Clues" by Nova Jacobs
5. "Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics" by Stephen Greenblatt
-- Mike S., Kansas City, Mo.
My finely tuned Biblioracling instincts tell me that Mike will enjoy "36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction" by Rebecca Newberger Goldstein.

1. "The Fog Seller" by Don Daglow
2. "The Rooster Bar" by John Grisham
3. "The President Is Missing" by Bill Clinton and James Patterson
4. "Little Fires Everywhere" by Celeste Ng
5. "Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI" by David Grann
-- Don A., Plainfield, Ill.
I think Don is ready for some Megan Abbott. It's impossible to go wrong, but I'll suggest he start with "The Fever."

1. "The Goldfinch" by Donna Tartt
2. "The Birth of Venus" by Sarah Dunant
3. "The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake" by Aimee Bender
4. "Matterhorn: A Novel of the Vietnam War" by Karl Marlantes
5. "Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers" by Mary Roach
-- Sherry L., Frankfort, Ill.
In her email to me, Sherry had very kind things to say about my book-recommending acumen, which I'd like to say does nothing to sway my decision to make a recommendation -- except it totally sways my decision. I think Sherry may enjoy Elizabeth McCracken's "The Giant's House."

Ford worker who faced demands for sex sues

Texto completo: A lawyer who recently won a $16.8-million jury verdict against Ford on behalf of a former Ford engineer on Friday filed another employment discrimination claim against the company, this time for sexual harassment.
Carol Laughbaum of Bloomfield Hills filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of DeAnna Johnson, 54, who started at the Ford Dearborn Truck Plant as a production supervisor in June 2018 after working years in similar roles for automotive suppliers.
"From the outset," the lawsuit said, Johnson, who is black, was subjected to "unwanted comments and conduct of a sexual nature, and unwanted comments of both a sexual and racial nature."
The lawsuit names Nicholas Rowan, Ford production supervisor, as the person charged with teaching Johnson her job and assessing her performance.
The lawsuit said Rowan would:
Repeatedly ask to see Johnson's breasts by saying, "Show me those black mounds [or mountains]" or "Show me those chocolate mounds [or mountains]."
Call Johnson "chocolate Jolly Rancher." And when she asked what that meant, he responded that she was a chocolate treat that he wanted to lick ..."
Constantly ask Johnson to send him pictures of herself naked.
Johnson ignored the lewd requests, the lawsuit said. On one occasion, Rowan grabbed Johnson's breast and then apologized for his hand "slipping."
The lawsuit said Johnson learned "Rowan has had sex with numerous women at the plant, many of whom are his subordinates and who rely on him for favorable terms, benefits and conditions of employment."
Ford response Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker responded to the lawsuit with this statement:
"Ford does not tolerate sexual harassment or discrimination. We take those claims very seriously and investigate them thoroughly. While we have not received this lawsuit, we are aware of the allegations. The plaintiff filed a Human Resources complaint in November 2018. We launched an investigation, immediately suspended the employee that was the subject of the complaint, then fired him in December. Ford also interviewed every supervisor who the plaintiff claims had knowledge of her allegations prior to her Human Resources complaint and found that the only supervisor to whom she complained immediately referred her complaint to Human Resources."
Allegation: Management knew The lawsuit says the conduct is "well known to higher management" and Rowan demonstrated "extremely violent and disturbing behavior in the workplace, including punching file cabinets."
Johnson was, "fearful of Rowan and his erratic behavior and because she needed her job, she attempted to be pleasant" but never participated in lewd talk or responded to his "disgusting demands," the lawsuit said.
Johnson told Rowan to stop or she would report him to Human Resources.
On numerous occasions, "Rowan stuck his cellphone" in Johnson's face, "showing her a picture or video of him engaged in sex," the lawsuit said. Johnson recognized the women in the images as assembly line workers who reported to him.
Rowan repeatedly told Johnson he wanted to have sex with her, advising that he did not yet have a black woman in his 'collection,'" the lawsuit said.
Rowan snapped pictures of Johnson from behind, without her permission, the lawsuit said. Around October 2018, Johnson told a manager named Rich Mahoney about the sexual talk, requests for sex and "sharing' sex pictures, the lawsuit said.
Mahoney told Johnson "she should 'just (have sex with Rowan) and get it over with,' " the lawsuit said.
Rowan sent Johnson sexual texts and "a photo of himself in his underwear, and pictures of his genitals, including a picture of his erect penis," the lawsuit said.
After receiving the penis picture, Johnson became ill, passed out and sought medical treatment at Beaumont Hospital, where she was kept overnight," the lawsuit said.
When Johnson returned to work, the situation continued to unravel.
A higher-level supervisor, Billy Markovich, asked Johnson how she was doing and then remarked that he didn't care about her problems, leaving Johnson in tears, the lawsuit said.
Days later, Markovich apologized to Johnson. He asked Johnson how bad things were between her and Rowan from 1 to 10, Johnson answered "100," the lawsuit said.
"Oh, God, I don't want to know," Markovich said.
Allegation: HR demanded her phone On a Saturday, Johnson reported Rowan again and it reached an assistant plant manager. The next Monday, Johnson received a call from Les Harris from Ford's Human Resources Department and was ordered to turn over her cellphone so that lewd images could be removed.
When Johnson asked Harris why Ford was not demanding Rowan's cellphone, Harris responded that Rowan refused to give it up, the lawsuit said. Harris then asked Johnson to sign paperwork authorizing Ford to conduct a search of Johnson's home and property.
The HR officials even called Johnson at 7 a.m. demanding she turn in her phone, the lawsuit said. Johnson "remains fearful of Rowan, has been forced off work on a medical leave, and has been medically unable to return to work."
Johnson sought professional help for issues Ford failed to address, the lawsuit said, and "has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, due to her extremely toxic and hostile work environment at Ford Motor Co."
The lawsuit said Ford "cut off Johnson's pay, leaving her in severe financial hardship."
When asked specifically about Ford cutting off pay to Johnson, "leaving her in financial hardship," as the lawsuit claimed, Felker pointed to the statement provided.
A public Facebook post by a Nick Rowan, time-stamped 10:14 a.m. Dec. 21, 2018, said, "Because of a false accusation, a zero tolerance policy and at the edge of early retirement, I am no longer a Ford Motor Company employee."
Previous verdict against Ford Laughbaum, the lawyer representing Johnson, prevailed against Ford on March 28, 2018, when a federal jury ruled that her client Faisal Khalaf, an industrial engineer born in Lebanon who worked for the carmaker for 15 years, was berated by supervisors week after week and criticized for his Arab background and accent.
One of Khalaf's supervisors would slam his fist on a table and scream at him about his English, Laughbaum said. "It wasn't a matter of 'Please, can you repeat this?' but 'What is wrong with you? Why don't you understand this?' "
The jury awarded Khalaf $15 million in punitive damages, $1.7 million in retirement and pension losses and $100,000 for emotional distress for the actions of Ford supervisors Bennie Fowler and Jay Zhou.
Fowler retired in October 2017, and Zhou is vice president over Quality Asia Pacific, Felker confirmed.
The case, filed under a statute that allows unlimited punitive damages, was intended to deter Ford "from future discriminatory employment practices," Laughbaum said at the time.
Ford's history Ford has a long history of litigation related to harassment in factories.
In January 2018, Ford CEO Jim Hackett made a public commitment to factory workers ,after flying to Chicago, that harassment would not be tolerated.
In August 2017, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that investigates workplace discrimination, reached a $10-million settlement with Ford for sexual and racial harassment at two Chicago plants. In 1999, Ford paid $22 million and promised to crack down on wrongdoing.
A separate lawsuit based on similar accusations is pending. On Dec. 19, 2017, the New York Times documented accounts of harassment that Hackett called "gut-wrenching" two days later. The report cited crude comments by male workers about female workers' breasts and buttocks, and graffiti of penises carved into tables and spray-painted on floors, as well as physical assaults over many years that have already cost the company.
Ford ran a 2-minute, 40-second video message on repeating loops throughout all 24 of its U.S. factories. The video featured Bruce Hettle, head of global manufacturing, and Jimmy Settles, UAW vice president assigned to Ford.
Johnson is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, lost wages, interest, attorney fees and an order barring Ford from further such behavior.
Johnson has had a career working as a production supervisor for automotive suppliers prior to joining Ford, and she's familiar with the setting, her attorney told the Free Press.
"This is one of the most egregious, disgusting cases of sexual harassment I've seen in 15 years," Laughbaum said. "When a guy is literally sending somebody pictures of their erect penis? That's a new one for me. Just these daily relentless requests for sex, literally every day and repeatedly. And it was obvious to everyone."

Texto completo: BOGOTÁ, Colombia -- The suspect in a car bombing that left 21 people dead on Thursday in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, was a member of the largest guerrilla group remaining in the country, the Colombian government said Friday.
José Aldemar Rojas Rodríguez, the suspect who was also killed that day, was part of the National Liberation Army, a Marxist rebel group known as the ELN, said Guillermo Botero, the Colombian defense minister.
The ELN did not claim responsibility, but it has increased attacks against the government since its rival guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, signed a peace deal with the government in 2016.
The attack on Thursday, near a police academy, was the first car bombing in Bogotá in years, a gruesome reminder of an era when such attacks were the norm, as drug lords and rebel groups waged aggressive terror campaigns, killing hundreds of civilians and security forces. Since the signing of the peace accords, the Colombian government has said it turned the page on that violent era.
Scenes of the carnage near the academy told a different story. Cellphone videos shared with The New York Times on Friday and filmed by someone who was at the scene showed a burning vehicle with a dismembered torso in blue pants sprawled in front of the flames. The camera also captured images of a human foot and what appeared to be a severed head.
Rescue workers struggled to carry possible survivors out on stretchers.
The attack against security forces in Colombia's center of power was an escalation of hostilities with the ELN, which in the past year has bombed police stations, attacked oil pipelines and kidnapped soldiers, policemen and military contractors.
In a speech on Friday night, President Iván Duque of Colombia announced that Colombian authorities had reactivated arrest warrants for members of the ELN leadership and had asked Cuba, where 10 members are based, to extradite them.
"The ELN is and has been a criminal machine of kidnappings and attacks," he said. "We have had enough of death."
Even before the attack, Mr. Duque, whose right-wing Democratic Center party campaigned against the peace deal with the FARC, expressed little enthusiasm for negotiating with the ELN.
"If the ELN really wants peace," he said on Friday, "they need to show the country concrete actions, like the immediate return of all kidnapped people and the end of all criminal actions."
Mr. Botero, the defense minister, said the attacker, Mr. Rojas, had joined the ELN in the 1990s and worked as an explosives instructor. He lost a hand at one point in an explosion and thereafter was known by the nickname "Mocho," slang in Colombia for someone who is missing a hand or arm.
In 2015, as the FARC was nearing its peace deal with the government, Mr. Rojas had tried three times to pass himself off as a member of that group to receive demobilization benefits, but FARC members rejected him repeatedly, said Mr. Botero, the defense minister.
The FARC, which has given up arms and formed a political party, worked to distance itself from the attack this week.
"We express our solidarity with the victims and their families," the party wrote in a statement after the attack. "And we call on all sectors of the country to keep building a pact that takes violence and weapons out of doing politics."
But the ELN has taken a different stance from their former guerrilla brethren.
Last January, a faction of the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed five police officers and wounded 40 others in a Colombian port city. During the summer, they tried to coax the government into negotiations by offering nine hostages for ransom. The kidnappings continued even this month, when the group said it had downed a civilian helicopter and taken three more hostages.
Jeremy McDermott, the co-founder of Insight Crime, a foundation that tracks criminal groups, said the group's fractured command structure meant that some factions kept fighting the government even while others may express interest in a peace deal.
"The ELN isn't a vertically integrated organization," he said.
His foundation is also tracking another problem for the government: Former rebels of the FARC who have taken up arms once again. Last fall, Insight Crime estimated that as many as 2,800 fighters may have returned to arms -- about 40 percent of the number that fought before the peace deal.
Jairo Libreros, a professor at Externado University in Bogotá who also works as a security analyst, said he saw little option for the government other than to continue fighting guerrilla groups like the rogue FARC fighters and ELN.
"The ELN is still anchored in ideologies from the last century," he said, referring to its vows to continue Marxist struggle. "But this attack closes any window there was for negotiation in the short term."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed on Friday a report that said President Trump had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.
The rare public statement by a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, challenged the facts of an article published by BuzzFeed News on Thursday saying that Mr. Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony.
"BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the special counsel's office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate," said the spokesman, Peter Carr.
The BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress before Mr. Carr's statement who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.
The president himself responded on Twitter late Friday, calling the special counsel's statement "a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!"
A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia's attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.
Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counsel's office weighed in.
"Two words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is 'categorically false,"' the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday.
BuzzFeed News maintained that its report was accurate, its editor, Ben Smith, said after Mr. Mueller's office disputed the account. "We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he's disputing," Mr. Smith said on Twitter.
The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel's spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.
The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report. One person familiar with Mr. Cohen's testimony to the special counsel's prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was "already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters."
If true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations "would constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice."
Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, another Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a tweet that "if the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached."
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February.
The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017 and that Mr. Trump has tried to conceal the details from senior administration officials about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trump's involvement in the project.
Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 -- before the first presidential primaries -- and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization. In fact, according to prosecutors, the discussions continued as late as June 2016, after Mr. Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trump's family about the negotiations.
When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trump's "political messaging."
That day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president. "There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?" he told reporters.
Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together. Mr. Ryan was working with lawyers for the Trump family as part of a joint defense agreement.
At least one of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohen's congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.
Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. But he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and proved credible, the special counsel's office said in a December sentencing memo.
Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said. Subsequently, he took care "not to overstate his knowledge or the role of others in the conduct under investigation" and provided "useful information" about his contacts with "persons connected to the White House" in 2017 and 2018, the special counsel's filing said.
That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohen's pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Mueller's. Driven by greed, they said, he "repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends."
Mr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes. He said he took full responsibility for his crimes, but said he acted out of blind loyalty to Mr. Trump, who he said "led me to choose a path of darkness over light."
During his nomination hearing this week to become attorney general, William P. Barr was asked if the president would have committed a crime if he had coached a witness to testify falsely -- or not to testify at all.
"Yes," Mr. Barr said. "Under an obstruction statute, yes."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Mary Oliver, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose rapturous odes to nature and animal life brought her critical acclaim and popular affection, has died. She was 83.
Bill Reichblum, Oliver's literary executor, said she died Thursday at her home in Hobe Sound, Florida. The cause of death was lymphoma.
"Thank you, Mary Oliver, for giving so many of us words to live by, Hillary Clinton wrote in a tweet. Ava DuVernay quoted from Oliver's poem "Praying and fans online shared their favorite lines.
Author of more than 15 poetry and essay collections, Oliver wrote brief, direct pieces that sang of her worship of the outdoors and disdain for greed, despoilment and other human crimes. One of her favorite adjectives was "perfect, and rarely did she apply it to people. Her muses were owls and butterflies, frogs and geese, the changes of the seasons, the sun and the stars.
"In my outward appearance and life habits I hardly change - there's never been a day that my friends haven't been able to say, and at a distance, There's Oliver, still standing around in the weeds. There she is, still scribbling in her notebook,' Oliver wrote in "Long Life, a book of essays published in 2004.
"But, at the center: I am shaking; I am flashing like tinsel.
Like her hero Walt Whitman, whom she would call the brother she never had, Oliver didn't only observe mushrooms growing in a rainstorm or an owl calling from a black branch; she longed to know and become one with what she saw. She might be awed by the singing of goldfinches or, as in the poem "White Flowers, overcome by a long nap in a field.
---
Never in my life
had I felt myself so near
that porous line
where my own body was done with
and the roots and the stems and the flowers
began
----
Her poetry books included "White Pine, 'West Wind and the anthology "Devotions, which came out in 2017. She won the Pulitzer in 1984 for "American Primitive and the National Book Award in 1992 for "New and Selected Poems. In 1998, she received the Lannan Literary Award for lifetime achievement. Her fans ranged from fellow poets Stanley Kunitz and Rita Dove to Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.
"Although few poets have fewer human beings in their poems than Mary Oliver, it is ironic that few poets also go so far to help us forward, Stephen Dobyns wrote of her in The New York Times.
Oliver was a native of Maple Heights in suburban Cleveland, and endured what she called a "dysfunctional family in part by writing poems and building huts of sticks and grass in the nearby woods. Edna St. Vincent Millay was an early influence and, while in high school, Oliver wrote to the late poet's sister, Norma, asking if she could visit Millay's house in Austerlitz, New York. Norma Millay agreed and Oliver ended up spending several years there, organizing Edna St. Vincent Millay's papers. While in Austerlitz, she also met the photographer Molly Malone Cook - "I took one look and fell, hook and tumble, Oliver later wrote - and the two were partners until Cook's death, in 2005. Much of Oliver's work was dedicated to Cook.
Oliver studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, but never graduated and later scorned much of her education as "a pre-established collection of certainties. She did teach at Case Western University and Bennington College among other schools, although much of her work drew upon her childhood and the landscape around Provincetown.
"I am not very hopeful about the Earth remaining as it was when I was a child. It's already greatly changed. But I think when we lose the connection with the natural world, we tend to forget that we're animals, that we need the Earth, Oliver, who rarely spoke to the press, told Maria Shriver during a 2011 interview for Oprah Winfrey's "O" magazine.
"If I have any lasting worth, it will be because I have tried to make people remember what the Earth is meant to look like.
She wrote often of mortality, but with a spirit of gratitude and completion. In "Circles, she pronounced herself "content not to live forever, having been "filled by what she saw and believed. In "When Death Comes, she hoped that at the end of life she could look back and see herself as a "bride married to amazement.
---
When it's over, I don't want to wonder
if I have made of my life something particular, and real.
I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,
or full of argument.
I don't want to end up having simply visited the world.

Texto completo: Westbrook's world-famous ice disk is spinning again, thanks to the efforts of a Freeport photographer, who used a paddleboard, an ice pick and an adventurous spirit Thursday afternoon to free the giant chunk of circular ice that was frozen on the banks of the Presumpscot River.
Andrew Sims said he felt compelled to free the disk because it had become stuck Wednesday, disappointing dozens of onlookers who had come to the city's River Walk to view the spectacle. He also saw an opportunity to do some time-lapse photography.
The disk had been surrounded by open water and was spinning slowly in a counterclockwise rotation until Wednesday, when it got stuck on and attached to stationary ice near the riverbank.
Sims returned to Westbrook on Thursday, and around 2:30 p.m. he launched his paddleboard into the river. While kneeling on the board, he began cutting an opening around the circle of ice, using his own weight and an ice pick to break the ice.
By 4:30 p.m., the disk was floating freely again and spinning counter-clockwise, the same direction as when it was first noticed Monday.
Sims, who was interviewed Thursday night while standing on the top level of a rooftop parking garage that overlooks the Presumpscot, said a crowd of onlookers started applauding when they realized his efforts to set the disc free had succeeded.
"It's awesome," Sims said. "I was pretty excited."
Watching the liberation mission unfold was Doug Bertlesman, who had a view from his riverfront office window at Ethos Marketing. Co-workers crowded around the window to watch. Some thought it was a fool's errand.
"We were like, 'This is insane. There was no way he's going to be able to do this.' He came at it from two sides and cut it loose. And then he pushed it, he pushed it across the river back to where it was. We're just laughing. There is no way. What an idiot. And sure enough."
As the temperature is expected remain well below freezing, Bertlesman suggested the city hire someone to "keep things moving."
"You can imagine the posting," said Bertlesman, who is also the lead singer in a band, Sons of Quint. "Must be good in a kayak and be able to withstand cold temperatures."
Sims' mission Thursday to free the disk followed a less successful apparent attempt Wednesday.
Westbrook police dissuaded a man on Wednesday afternoon from trying to climb onto the famous slab of frozen river water. Police went to the end of Ash Street in response to a report that a man had tethered himself to a tree with a rope and ventured onto the ice near the bank of the Presumpscot River in an apparent attempt to reach the disk.
The attempted boarding of the disk was captured partially on video from a nearby office building. The video shows five people standing on the shore as a sixth person walks toward the edge of the ice disk while trailing a rope and poking at the sheet of ice below him with a stick or cane.
The video ends before the man reaches the disk, and before police arrived to end the expedition.
"This is something that happens," police Capt. Steven Goldberg said. "We don't always have an ice disk on the river, but we always get ice and people try to get out onto the ice, and it's never safe. The ice on the Presumpscot River in Westbrook is never thick enough to go on."
Police did not have any reason to compel the man to give his name, and he did not tell police who he was.
"People are strange sometimes with their motivation," Goldberg said. "He left the scene. He was safe. It could have been a lot worse, and luckily it wasn't."
Westbrook's ice disk has drawn international media attention to Maine while fueling jokes about a supernatural omen or alien invasion.
The disk has been covered by the BBC, ABC's "Good Morning America" and The New York Times, among other outlets.
Adding to the mystery, two more ice disks were reported Wednesday in Maine. One was in Baxter State Park on Nesowadnehunk Stream, and the other was nearby on the West Branch of the Penobscot River, near the Abol Bridge.
But the ice disk in Westbrook is much larger. Seen from above, it is a perfectly symmetrical circle of ice about 300 feet across that vaguely resembles a moon.
Dozens of people lined the river bank late Thursday afternoon. Most were content to take photographs of the ice disk with their cellphones or to stand back and admire nature's work. Nearby restaurants and bars were packed with customers.
"It looks like the moon," said Hunter McGuire, who drove more than an hour from her home in Readfield, with her mother, Heather McGuire, and their dog Jade -- a black poodle -- just to see the disk. The McGuires, who moved to Maine recently from Florida, had never visited Westbrook before.
"We had to see this phenomenon, because we'll never see anything like it again," Heather McGuire said.
Betty and Terry Phillips live in Bridgton. They had an appointment Thursday morning in Augusta before deciding to drive to Westbrook to see the ice disk, which they had heard about on television. The couple said the long drive was worth the trip.
"I am so pleased," Betty Phillips said. "It's fascinating and it is awesome."
Legends Restaurant and Taproom, which is located a few feet from the river path, was doing a booming business Thursday evening.
Bartender Chyle Cameron said the establishment saw an opportunity to capitalize on the ice disk craze, so earlier this week it started serving up Ice Disk Cosmo, a mix of raspberry vodka; Chamboard, which is a raspberry liqueur; and lime.
"It has been flying today," Cameron said, referring to the drink's popularity.
Ice disks are natural phenomena that form in rivers and streams and range greatly in size. They are believed to be almost perfectly round because the shoreline or other ice formations grind down the edges of a mass after it begins to rotate in an eddy current.
One study that explored why the disks spin theorized that a vortex of cooling water under the ice helps propel the motion, but that experiment used tiny, 4-inch disks in artificially heated water baths as hot as 140 degrees.

Texto completo: Mary Oliver, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose lyrical descriptions of the lamp-eyed owl, the white-toothed bear and the lilies by the pond evoked natural wonders with a startling clarity of vision, while suggesting that life was a matter of learning to love the world even in the face of ugliness and pain, died Jan. 17 at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 83.
The cause was lymphoma, said her literary executor, Bill Reichblum.
A prolific writer who published a new collection almost every other year, Ms. Oliver was a rarity in modern American literature - a best-selling poet, so popular she was interviewed by journalist Maria Shriver in O, the Oprah Magazine, and honored in a tweet by former secretary of state Hillary Clinton "for giving so many of us words to live by."
Often compared to her literary idol Ralph Waldo Emerson, with whom she shared an abiding interest in the natural world, Ms. Oliver combined a precise, unfussy style with an almost religious devotion to examining nature.
Sexually abused by her father and neglected by her mother, she spent much of her childhood walking in the woods near her Ohio home, scribbling lines in a notebook and reading from a volume of Walt Whitman poetry she kept in her knapsack. She described nature as a source of solace, beauty and wisdom, perhaps most memorably in her poem "Wild Geese":
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting - over and over announcing your place in the family of things. "I could not be a poet without the natural world," she once wrote. "Someone else could. But not me. For me the door to the woods is the door to the temple."
While many of her contemporaries were creatures of the academy, holders of graduate degrees and distinguished professorships, Ms. Oliver kept her distance. She never graduated from college and taught only occasionally, including for several years at Bennington College in Vermont. With the exception of her partner, Molly Malone Cook, with whom she lived in Provincetown, Mass., for more than five decades, Ms. Oliver seemed to prefer the company of dogs to people.
Yet her poetry was far from aloof, encompassing themes of love, prayer and beauty in a warm and plain-spoken style that divided critics and literary scholars, some of whom accused her of sentimentality. Ms. Oliver chalked up the criticism to "a kind of eliteness among academics."
Writing in free verse, she eschewed the formal experimentation of her modernist contemporaries, and followed in a line of pastoral American poets that included Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop and Edna St. Vincent Millay, at whose home Ms. Oliver lived for several years as a teenager. She also found inspiration in the Sufi writer Rumi, whom she described as a model of brevity and spiritually focused poetry.
Ms. Oliver was 28 when, in 1963, she made her literary debut with "No Voyage and Other Poems." She went on to receive the Pulitzer for her 1983 collection "American Primitive" and the National Book Award for poetry for her 1992 work "New and Selected Poems."
"Although few poets have fewer human beings in their poems than Mary Oliver, it is ironic that few poets also go so far to help us forward," poet and novelist Stephen Dobyns wrote in the New York Times, reviewing "New and Selected Poems." Her work, he argued, was centered on the question of how to love the world when it is "intrinsically unlovable," when nature is "neither pretty nor nice" and "life is mostly a matter of dying."
Ms. Oliver's answer to that question, which she herself posed in the poem "Spring," was simple but profound: Learn to love, and thus to live, by attending to the world. "To pay attention," she wrote in another poem, "this is our endless and proper work."
Mary Jane Oliver was born in Maple Heights, Ohio, on Sept. 10, 1935. Her father was a social studies teacher in the nearby Cleveland school system, and her mother was a secretary at a local elementary school. "I had a very dysfunctional family, and a very hard childhood," Ms. Oliver told O magazine in 2011. She was sexually abused when she was "very little," she added. "So I made a world out of words. And it was my salvation."
Ms. Oliver began writing when she was 14, always while walking, as an escape from her troubled home life. "To this day," she told the radio program "On Being," "I don't care for the enclosure of buildings."
After graduating from high school she left Ohio, traveled to Millay's house in Upstate New York and befriended the late poet's sister, helping to organize Millay's papers. She studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College but never received a degree.
Ms. Oliver was visiting the Millay estate in the late 1950s when she met Cook, a Village Voice photographer who later became a gallery and bookstore owner and an assistant to writer Norman Mailer. Together, they settled in Provincetown, sometimes feeding themselves by foraging for berries and digging for clams.
Often described as a recluse, she gave few interviews because of what her biographer Lindsay Whalen called "an older understanding" of what it meant to be a poet. "The poem was a direct communication with the reader," Whalen said in an interview. "For her, a knowledge of the personal details of the writer's life was just a distraction."
Her other works included "House of Light" (1990), the book-length poem "The Leaf and the Cloud" (2000), "Dog Songs" (2013) and "Devotions" (2017), a career-spanning collection of more than 200 poems. Ms. Oliver also published several books of prose, including the essay collections "Long Life" (2004) and "Upstream" (2016).
With Cook's death in 2005, Ms. Oliver - who has no immediate survivors - took on an increasingly personal tone in her work. She also became more overtly political, critics said, as her nature poems were shadowed by allusions to climate change and environmental destruction.
Still, there remained the sense of wonder that Ms. Oliver had nurtured for decades, and memorialized in works such as "When Death Comes," from "New and Selected Poems." The poem ended with Ms. Oliver looking ahead to her own death, writing:
When it's over, I want to say all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms. When it's over, I don't want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don't want to end up simply having visited this world. harrison.smith@washpost.com

Ken Starr: William Barr should not be forced to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller investigation

Texto completo: Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated former President Bill Clinton, said President Trump’s attorney general nominee should not be forced to recuse himself from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

Some Democrats have pushed for William Barr to step aside if he is confirmed to the top spot at the Justice Department, citing a 19-page legal memorandum he authored over the summer concluding Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey could not constitute an obstruction of justice.

Starr argued in an opinion piece published by the New York Times on Thursday that the memorandum was merely meant to warn of “the inherent danger of prosecutorial overreach.”

“Firing James Comey, the F.B.I. director, may have been wise or unwise, but it should not in conscience be stretched to accuse a sitting president of criminal conduct. Nor should the mere expression of hope that Mr. Comey would go easy on Mr. Trump’s embattled national security adviser, Michael Flynn, somehow be transmogrified into a violation of federal law,” he wrote.

Starr continued, “Holding the president accountable for the exercise of his powers under Article II of the Constitution is a task entrusted to Congress, not to a largely unaccountable special counsel.”

Barr admitted this week he shared the memo with the Justice Department as well as several lawyers connected to Trump, but he said it was based solely on public information about the investigation.

Democrats pressed Barr on his criticisms of the Mueller investigation, which he would oversee if confirmed by the Senate, at his confirmation hearing earlier this week. Trump’s nominee assured Democrats that he would allow the special counsel to complete the investigation.

“In light of what we know, I see no reason he should step aside. Expressing his legal perspective on a legal theory of obstruction of justice should not come close to justifying the extraordinary action of requiring him to recuse himself from what will be one of the new attorney general’s most pressing responsibilities,” Starr wrote.

Schiff: We wanted to reassure NATO allies worried that Trump wants to withdraw

Texto completo: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he and his colleagues were planning to reassure North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies of the U.S.' commitment to the alliance during an overseas trip, in light of media reports that Trump has told aides he wants to withdraw from the military alliance.

But Trump canceled the trip Thursday, citing the partial government shutdown.

“We had anticipated an important defense and intelligence briefings in Afghanistan,” Schiff said. “We were looking forward to the opportunity to reassure NATO allies undoubtedly shaken by reports that the president has questioned his staff or opined about leaving NATO. We're determined to make sure that our NATO our allies understand that on a very bipartisan basis our commitment to NATO is strong.”

The New York Times reported on Monday that Trump has privately discussed his desire to withdraw the U.S. from NATO on multiple occasions, including around the time of the NATO summit last July, when he was questioning the usefulness of the alliance. At the time, Trump cited that European allies needed to step up their defense spending.

Despite the congressional delegation’s plans to meet with NATO allies, Trump announced that he was canceling Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Brussels and Afghanistan in light of the partial government shutdown. Although Trump said Pelosi was welcome to travel on a commercial flight, he said “it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the shutdown.”

Schiff said he would not comment on Pelosi’s travel plans but said he thought “the president's decision to disclose a trip that a Speaker is making to a war zone was completely and utterly irresponsible in every way.”

“We think this is a completely inappropriate action,” Schiff said. “And the president's concern about a [congressional delegation] going to a war zone, apparently doesn't apply to a delegation from the administration going to Davos the following week because we’ve got confirmation that is still planned.”

A White House official told the Washington Examiner that although the military is fully funded at the moment, Trump may cancel military flights accordingly. The official said all congressional delegations are canceled while the shutdown continues.

Even so, the White House official said a presidential delegation will still attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, from Jan. 22 to 25. However, Trump decided not to attend due to the partial government shutdown.

Taking issue with Cal Thomas

Texto completo: In his column published Jan. 11, Cal Thomas uses verbal tactics similar to those made popular by the current administration and others who want to deny or bend the truth, or at least claim to present their opinion as truth, by branding opponents to their way of thinking with some demeaning term. In this case, Thomas brands those who accept the overwhelming science behind climate change as a “cult,” when, in fact, that term would be better applied to climate-change deniers. Much like those who believe the world to be flat, the conclusions fly in the face of scientific analysis.
Sure, scientists can be found who support anyone’s beliefs, especially if their conclusions are taken out of context or their findings are applied to a small piece of the puzzle. Thomas did just that when he quoted meteorologist Roy Spencer to point out that global temperatures declined for the past two years, implying global warming was not real. Any intelligent person would know two years does not make a trend in geological history.
Ironically, the New York Times published an article on the same day quoting from an article in the Journal of Science that ocean temperatures are warming 40 percent faster than estimated five years ago. Oceans absorb 93 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gasses, according to the article, which makes the rest of the globe appear to be warming more slowly.
Ocean warming can have as great an impact on our lives (and our economy) as what we narrowly argue as climate change (the temperatures we feel). Food supplies are affected by the death of coral reefs and warmer ocean temperatures may lead to more powerful ocean storms, causing more damage (and more taxpayer money to repair that damage).
People need to think about the “truth” as it is presented by any extremist on either side of the political spectrum before accepting as fact what is simply an unproven belief.

Lawmakers here today, gone to Maui

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

Texto completo: Undermining free speech
Two seemingly disparate news stories struck me because of the similarity of the issues involved.
The first was an op-ed by Ursula Lindsey appearing in the New York Times regarding Saudi Arabia's demand that Netflix remove an episode of Patriot Act because the host comedian, Hasan Minhaj, mocked the crown prince's lame attempts to cover up his role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and for his war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia used a vague cyber crime law that forbids using the airwaves to impinge on public order, religious values and public morals to order Netflix to remove that episode. Netflix complied.
The second story, an op-ed by Kate Ruane and Abdullah Hasan in the Concord Monitor (Opinion, Jan. 14), concerned Marco Rubio's attempt to introduce a bill that allows states to boycott boycotters who support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. What Rubio is advocating is similar to what Saudi Arabia is doing through its legal system. He wants to use the power of the government to silence speech by threatening state retaliation for expressing a point of view. Such a law undermines the protections afforded us in the First Amendment of the Constitution and is similar to how Saudi Arabia suppresses speech.
No matter where one stands on the BDS movement or support for Israel, we cannot allow our Constitution to be undermined. Our senators must not support this bill.

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been unable to shake off allegations of sexual harassment on his 2016 campaign, an issue that could dog his 2020 White House ambitions.

While Sanders, 77, is trying to be proactive and was slated to meet Wednesday with women who had made accusations of sexual harassment against Sanders 2016 staffers, Democrats warn that the issue will be difficult to counter — especially with a number of high-profile women running against him.

"He may be completely innocent when it comes to responsibility when it comes to this, but it's definitely on the radar now, especially with all the women now [running for president]," said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. "Everybody's going to have their issue that they put forward, and some that they'll have a problem defending. But clearly, on that list of things that candidates have to defend, this is one of them."

For some Democrats, Sanders has already made major missteps in handling the situation after multiple staffers on his campaign complained of sexual harassment and pay disparity stemming from his first presidential bid. One Democratic strategist pointed to what they saw as a tone-deaf response immediately after the news broke when Sanders said he wasn't aware of the allegations because he was "a little bit busy running around the country" trying to become president.

"I don't think it's a death knell for him ... But I do think it's a problem for him for sure," said the Democratic strategist. "I don't think Sanders handled this particularly well ... If you can't manage to create a culture in your presidential campaign, which is small compared to what happens in an administration, then I think it's a big leap to ask that you can then be trusted with the presidency if you can't keep track of the culture you've created and [what] your most trusted employees are doing and the way they're managing your staff."

In the #MeToo era, Sanders is trying to avoid the pitfalls that have taken down other Democrats, including former Rep. Elizabeth Etsy, who announced she would not run for re-election in November after mishandling an abuse claim by a staffer against her chief of staff, effectively ending her political career.

Among those steps is a change at the top. Jeff Weaver, Sanders' longtime consultant and campaign manager on the 2016 bid, told the New York Times that he will not reprise his role. Democrats expect Sanders to hire a lot of women in high places on the campaign, in part to overcome the "Bernie bro" image and the charges against his 2016 team.

Sanders supporters say they are are confident that he is taking the proper steps. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a supporter and friend of Sanders, said that news of meetings with accusers was an "an indication that he's taking it seriously, and he should."

"With the #MeToo movement, it's an issue for every campaign," Welch said, indicating that he will support him again if he runs. "Who knows when and how it will come up, and I think every campaign, including Sen. Sanders', has to take it very, very seriously."

Part of the issue, some Democrats argue, is the longtime structure of campaigns, particularly non-top tier presidential, Senate, and congressional operations, many of which do not include human resource departments. Some expect to see those become more common now.

Nevertheless, the issue could be a powerful one. Ironically, Sanders' meeting with the accusers comes a day after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., announced plans to form a presidential exploratory committee. Perhaps more than any other potential candidate, Gillibrand is expected to make #MeToo and sexual harassment a cornerstone of her bid.

"When that charge is levied against him by a woman, I think A) it's a potent attack, and B) I personally don't have a lot of faith that he's going to handle that attack very well," the Democratic strategist said. "You could just sort of imagine someone like Kirsten Gillibrand bringing this up in a debate, and the condescension and dismission he would show toward her could be devastating. That wouldn't surprise me at all."

Washington builds plenty of walls. And then charges you to pass through the gate

Texto completo: Somewhere in the third week of the government shutdown, the Associated Press figured out how to make some average readers far distant from the Beltway get worked about it. “Government shutdown may slow flow of Louisiana beer,” the headline declared.

How does that work? “The agency responsible for approving licenses for new breweries and new labels for beer distributed out of state — the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau — is among those with shuttered operations” during the shutdown.

The AP listed a few ways in which the shutdown hampers local brewers, but it focused on the labeling issue, which may be an issue on which you, dear reader, lack intimate familiarity.

Within the Department of the Treasury, you see, is a bureau widely known (relatively speaking) as the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, but legally named the Tax and Trade Bureau, or TTB. TTB has a handful of divisions including the Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division. ALFD in turn has three offices.

ALFD’s Formulation/Malt Beverage and Distilled Spirits Office (let’s call it the F/MB&DSO) reviews and processes TTB Form 5100.31, the “Application for and Certification/Exemption of Label/Bottle Approval (COLA).”

Since Congress and the White House haven’t passed into law appropriations for the Treasury Department, all nonessential Treasury employees are furloughed and cannot work. That includes TTB, and in turn ALFD, and its crucial F/MB&DSO.

They say you never realize what you’ve got until it’s gone, and the government shutdown is another lesson in this. Before now, if an out of state brewery issued a new seasonal, you could simply purchase it across state lines thanks to the tireless work of the folks at UST’s TTB working in the ALFD at F/MB&DSO.

Without these federal workers, there are no Form 5100.31 approvals, and thus no interstate shipments of beer with new labels.

No F/MB&DSO, no Louisiana beer. Got it?

Of course, if you’re a particularly skeptical type, you may have a question that was never broached in that AP article:

Why in the world should a brewer need federal approval on new beer labels?

Once we ask that question, a thousand analogous questions come to mind. And in the asking, we expose the trick in so many stories about the crucial work of our expansive federal government. The trick is that the government’s work is often made necessary only by needless federal meddling in the first place.

The story on Louisiana beer brought to mind the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway play “You Can’t Take It with You.”

A federal agent visits Grandpa to demand his tax payments. When Grandpa questions what he will get for his tax payment, the agent comes around to “Interstate Commerce.”

“If there weren’t Interstate Commerce,” the agent says, “nothing could go from one state to another. See?”

“Why not?” Grandpa asks. “They got fences?”

“No, they haven’t got fences. They’ve got laws !”

So, while Donald Trump still doesn’t have his physical barrier at the southern border, TTB and other federal bodies, amid their shutdowns, still have their proverbial fences--their federal liquor-control laws and regulations. They simply lack the bureaucrats who can open the proverbial gates.

The trick—you need government to overcome obstacles created by government—is so obvious, yet you’ll find commentators and reporters constantly lecturing their readers to be more grateful for government.

“[S]o many Americans who say they support cutting government programs don’t realize just how much they benefit from them,” a New York Times blogger wrote a few years back, making a typical argument.

The blogger then listed the largest “benefits” or “government social programs” that help Americans. The top two were tax deductions.

The argument is that without the federal government you wouldn’t have as many federal tax deductions. That’s is as sensible as saying that without the bully taking your sandwich, you wouldn’t have the juice box and crackers he left behind.

We wouldn't need a federal "benefit" to keep some chunk of our income if the federal government wasn't taking so much of our money in the first place. Pardon us if we don't express gratitude. We wouldn't need federal workers to allow interstate shipment of newly labeled beer if the federal government didn't restrict interstate shipment of newly labeled beer.

A government shutdown is a bad thing—especially one this long. Many government functions are necessary. Federal workers, including the men and women at UST TTB ALFD F/MB&DSO who review Forms 5100.31, are generally publicly spirited people who rely on their paychecks to feed a family.

But when some reporter tries to tell you to be grateful that the federal government is opening a gate for you, ask them why the wall is there in the first place.

Successful Aging: Maintaining a positive outlook helps in recovery and good health

Texto completo: I am a 78-year old healthy woman facing a fourth surgery on my leg and am a bit depressed. Fortunately, I’ve recovered well from the previous three. Up until now I have been very active, hiking, traveling, dancing and continuing to work in my career. Several friends who have had recent surgeries tell me I need to get used to doing less and that’s just what I should expect given my age. Their negative outlook is distressing to me. Can you offer a little hope? T.S.
Dear T.S.
Yes, hope is on its way. Let’s look at the reality. We know with age we will experience changes at some point in time. Some might be disease related, others more mechanical such as a joint replacement. We may need more sleep and slow down a bit. Our immune system may not be as efficient. And then there are changes in our vision and hearing. Add to that the loss of muscle mass and flexibility. Many of these normal changes can be postponed with healthy lifestyles.
And part of that healthy lifestyle is our attitude. Here is what we know:
Becca Levy and colleagues from Yale found that those who are optimistic about their age and reject aging stereotypes can extend their life by 7.5 years. This powerful finding takes into account age, gender, wealth and self-reported health and loneliness. This research is based on a study of 660 men and women in Ohio who were followed for over 20 years. Levy found the years they gained from having a positive attitude was more than the years gained from low blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and regular exercise.
In today’s world, it can be difficult to maintain a positive view of aging as we live in a youth-centric society, particularly in Southern California. On our sunny days we are surrounded by sleek bodies in their beach, running and biking attire. In addition to our culture, preferences for youth over older age are evident in employment, movies, the advertising industry, marketing and more. But the times are slowly changing.
A recent New York Times story (January 9, 2019) headlined “Older and in Power, Unwilling to Remain Unseen” referred to four older women in positions of power: Susan Zirinksy at 66 will take over CBS News in March and is the first woman to do so. Then there is Nancy Pelosi who at 78 was re-elected to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Representative Maxine Waters at 79 will lead the Financial Services Committee. And Glenn Close at 71 beat out four younger women to win the Golden Globe award for best actress.
Yes, these all are women, which makes their position noteworthy because in general age works against women a little bit more than it does for men. You’ve heard the expression – gray hair on a man is distinguished; on a woman it’s old age. Additionally, women confront two biases: age and gender.
Let’s continue to look at reality. Those who have an illness, particularly chronic ones, may have a hard time being optimistic. Illness is scary, forcing people to deal with uncertainty, lack of control and turning themselves over to doctors. For many there is a realization their life is finite. Being positive all of the time may be unrealistic.
Older adults are resilient. They have lived through wars, divorces, losing a job, relocating, financial concerns, illness and then spring back. Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50” writes that older people feel less stress and regret; they dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. As a result, older adults are reported to be happier in their later years. Clearly difficult events continue to occur; it’s their response to the events that changes over time.
Although I am in no position to judge your current situation, it sounds as though your problem is likely fixable, given you have recovered well from your previous leg surgeries. Yet there is always uncertainty.
There is hope. Your ongoing positive outlook and resilience should serve you well. As to your friends, you might mention that everyone is a case of one – and in your case you are planning for a full recovery and resuming your active life. I feel confident that you will do everything possible to make that happen.

Most of the conspiracy theories don't pan out

Texto completo: Before we get to the question of whether the president of the United States is a Russian asset, let's consider another question: When was the last time a popular and contentious conspiracy theory turned out to be true? Not a little true, but, like, really true?
It does happen. Whittaker Chambers was right about Alger Hiss being a Soviet spy. The government really did put poison in legal alcohol during Prohibition.
But even when conspiracy theorists earn the right to say "We told you so," the actual reality often falls short of the mark. The motives of the conspirators aren't as sinister as claimed, or the plot is better explained by incompetence than malevolence, or the scope of the conspiracy itself isn't nearly as vast as suspected.
This has always been my problem with the most extreme versions of the Russian collusion theories. The British former journalist and politician Louise Mensch offers an extreme version. Among her claims: Vladimir Putin had my late friend Andrew Breitbart murdered so that former Donald Trump consigliere Steve Bannon could take over Breitbart's eponymous website; Russian intelligence planted Hillary Clinton's emails on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop; pretty much the whole of the GOP leadership is in cahoots with the Kremlin.
I have a similar problem with the Deep State theories that have bounced around the Trumpian right: President Trump's problems are all the result of the fiendish doings of a vast "globalist" conspiracy.
"The central premise," Infowars nutter Jerome Corsi writes in his book "Killing the Deep State," "is that President Trump is the target of a coup d'etat being undertaken by the Deep State, including the CIA, NSA, and other intelligence agencies that maintain a commitment to a globalist New World Order." The Deep State hates Trump, the argument goes, because his victory meant it could no longer "continue running the international drug trade while supporting the military-industrial complex in a policy of perpetual war."
Obviously, most sane people on either side of the Trumpian divide reject the cartoonish versions of their own positions. But similarities endure.
The bombshell New York Times report that the FBI opened an investigation into whether Trump was a Russian asset strikes me as simultaneously understandable and outrageous. Trump's behavior in 2016 and early 2017 was enough to overload the pattern-recognition software of anyone not already committed to Trump's innocence at all costs, particularly if you were both reading the news and receiving raw, and occasionally flawed, intelligence such as the Steele dossier.
Trump's disastrous hiring of actual Kremlin stooges and cronies, his praise of Putin, his lies about business dealings with Russia, his public beseeching of the Kremlin to release Clinton's emails, his campaign's infamous meeting at Trump Tower with an actual Russian agent, not to mention his firing of the FBI director and his comments to Russian officials in the Oval Office: One doesn't even need to resort to Deep State theories to understand why the FBI would be concerned.
But that doesn't necessarily make Trump a Manchurian president either. He or his campaign may or may not have colluded with Russia. The Department of Justice might have cut corners to "get" him. Still, rather than elaborate conspiracies, it's far more likely that ad hoc decisions were made in the response to ad hoc actions by a candidate who thought he was going to lose and, later, by a president who didn't know what he was doing.
Jeb Bush was right when he predicted in 2015 that "chaos candidate" Trump would be a "chaos president."
The Atlantic just published a list, "Unthinkable: 50 Moments that Define an Improbable Presidency," and what comes through most is that Trump's glandular, impulsive and often vindictive character is the only reliable signal in the noise that is his presidency.
Any theory that doesn't take this into account is not likely to pan out.

Texto completo: "This body must speak out against this evil."
Rep. James Clyburn
D-S.C.
WASHINGTON – The House nearly unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday condemning Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, for questioning why phrases such as "white supremacist" are offensive.
King voted for the resolution himself. It passed 424 to 1.
Before the vote, King said he agreed with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy." The resolution invoked King's comments and condemned such words as "hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States."
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country.
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.
He said his "white supremacist" comments had not come across as he intended.
King sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber as Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, urged his colleagues to support the resolution. A handful of Republicans sat nearby. Many stood up to condemn racism.
On the other side of the aisle, about two dozen Democrats sat in rapt silence as Clyburn, a civil rights veteran, invoked the work of Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday was Tuesday.
"Now is the time to do right," Clyburn said before the vote. "This body must speak out against this evil."
The sole "no" vote came from Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., an African-American, who said the measure did not go far enough.
Minimally, King should be censured, Rush said Tuesday, and if he continues making such remarks, he should be expelled from Congress.
"Steve King has made a career out of being a racist, and he needs to be called out as such," he said.
The vote followed a series of condemnations from lawmakers in both parties. A handful of prominent Republicans said King should leave Congress, and top House Republicans voted Monday not to assign King any committees in the new Congress. King was on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
He had been the chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled the House.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?" King said in an interview with The New York Times last week. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
"The House Republicans denounce his language. We do not believe in his language, and we've decided that he will not serve on any" committees, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Tuesday. He said it was up to King whether he should resign.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the No. 3 House Republican, went further, echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: "I think that he should find another line of work," she said. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also called on King to resign.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, 235-199, with the help of a coalition of women, African-Americans and Hispanics. They ushered in the most diverse class yet, breaking records for the number of women and minorities. The House GOP became less diverse, seeing a decline in the number of women and the loss of the sole African-American Republican woman in the House, Mia Love of Utah.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., applauded Republican leaders for their "strong" actions against King on Tuesday. "I think they did the right thing," he said. "I think they're very concerned about their party being perceived as a Steve King party."
Hoyer said the party was discussing two measures that would censure King – one by Rush and a more narrow one from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio – acknowledging that such actions could open a Pandora's box. "It is a big deal to be censured," he said.
Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce, the first Republican to join Ryan's censure resolution and a member of the steering committee that stripped King of his committees, told USA TODAY he tried to have a "man-to-man" conversation with King when he "made stupid comments" about immigrants in 2013.
"My point was that when you say stupid things, it splashes on all of us," Joyce said. "He said, well, he gets good publicity out of it. I said, 'Well you need to think about other people here because it's not right.'"

Tidy up without Ms. Kondo; Here's why you don't need her help to finally get your place organized

Texto completo: Bright and early Jan. 1, there was a new reality to face.
Marie Kondo was in your living room.
For the past four years or so, Kondo, a professional organizer from Japan, has been on the march. She penned two publishing juggernaut books that occupied slots 1 and 2 on The New York Times best-seller list, simultaneously. She was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People. An odd list of almost-relevant celebrities professed their love for her. She arrived at cultural phenom status by telling people how to clean up.
Now, Netflix has delivered Kondo and her KonMari method to our digital doorsteps, dropping an eight-episode season of "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" on Jan. 1.
It's a U.S. version of her reality show, which follows along as she visits messy, cluttered houses and makes them neat again, all while maintaining a perfect, omnipresent smile and her preternaturally crisp, trademark bangs.
She definitely timed it right - January is when many of us think about how we manage our stuff, having accumulated more of it during the preceding holiday season. Clutter is also a legitimate source of stress, and the stress epidemic is currently rolling along at breakneck pace. Any potential relief - like a supernaturally calm neatness guru - is almost irresistible.
Princeton scientists have shown that cluttered environments have an impact on the brain's ability to focus, and affect working memory. At UCLA, research on family life showed that the stress hormones of mothers spiked whenever they had to deal with the family's possessions. Yale researchers documented a spike in brain activity that points to genuine psychological pain when people are asked to part with possessions - in hoarders, it's akin to the pain of drug withdrawal.
Yet Kondo falls short in addressing the psychological implications of clutter, even though there is definitely cause to examine some of the behavior demonstrated on her show. The borderline-unlikable couple in the first episode spar in an uncomfortable way, while the ever-smiling Kondo urges them to talk to their clothes. How about talking to a therapist? Cleaning up, while it has great psychological benefits, is unlikely to solve underlying issues - the unexamined mound of trashy possessions is hardly worth throwing out since the angst is still piling up.
Kondo's almost android-like persona doesn't allow for confrontation: She's set to perma-soothe. Her best effort at getting people to understand their problem with clutter is to force them to pile all of their clothes, for instance, in one place, look at it, then start sorting. She doesn't judge, but stands back and waits for a revelation to hit.
Not making us feel bad about our messes is a huge part of her appeal and hits at the basic truth that no one can learn our lessons for us. What doesn't seem necessary is the pseudo-ritual she's concocted to go along with cleaning, which involves holding each item to see if it brings you a zing! of joy (Kondo is at her most animated when describing this zing), then thanking each holey sock and sprung-elastic bathing suit before consigning them to rapidly filling garbage bags.
I'm all for gratitude, and I get the notion of revisiting the memory of the great concert you went to as you are bidding fond farewell to the ragged concert T-shirt. Applying that to every item you own seems like a little bit of magical thinking that is bound to ring false when you're looking at your 25th pair of pilled, black underwear. And it's likely to make your cleanup take seven times longer than it needs to.
Kondo's theories also hit a snag when it comes to her main sorting criteria. "Does this item spark joy?" is an OK question to ask, but there's also "does this item replicate the 2,000 other Christmas nutcrackers in our rumpus room?" and "does this item represent the tipping point into insanity?"
Kondo nods at the idea that we'd all be better off with less stuff, but she's most intent on building in a way to let ourselves off the hook when we hang on to too much - leaving us to wonder whether some of her subjects are headed for a serious relapse into clutter. (I'd bet on it.)
Bottom line: Mindlessly surrounding ourselves with more stuff is bad. But you don't need Kondo to break the habit and get your place cleaned up. If you want to watch her tiptoe around messy houses as a way to ease into a cleanup of your own, I won't deny you. Episode 3 features an adorable family relocating from Michigan to California, and delivers enough of Kondo's system to give you the idea.
cdampier@chicagotribune.com
To get started, here's all you really need to know
Break down the task. Kondo's real magic is in creating a basic order to do things in. Pick one category of stuff at a time, look at what you have, and start sorting.
"Do I use this item, and/or do I love it?" are still the best criteria for choosing what to keep and what to get rid of. You can skip thanking your old socks if you want to.
You don't need to feel guilty about accumulating things, or getting rid of them. Let all that, and the stuff, go. It's healthy on every front. If you notice some other issues cropping up as you clean, consider tackling those with a therapist.
Organizing is not hard. Group things by categories, and make sure the most-used items are stored in the most-accessible places, close to where you use them. Give everything a home it can always be returned to.
Any Gap employee can fold a T-shirt. Kondo's "origami-like" folding has been much discussed, but any folding style that works for you is good. Just choose a method, and stick to it.
Maintaining a house is everyone's job. Make your family the owners of the organizational system, not just the beneficiaries - participation and understanding are key.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- After an uproar, Alex Jones's mass media revival proved short-lived.
Last year, Mr. Jones, the Infowars conspiracy theorist, was erased from virtually every major social media platform for violating standards against hate speech, among others. This week, it came to light that Mr. Jones had a new, free channel on the streaming service Roku, which brings online video content to users' televisions, granting Mr. Jones access to Roku's 27 million users.
No more.
News that Infowars was available on Roku ignited a social media fury, coming months after Apple, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and others banned Infowars content.
"After the Infowars channel became available, we heard from concerned parties and have determined that the channel should be removed from our platform," the company said in a statement on Tuesday evening. "Deletion from the channel store and platform has begun and will be completed shortly."
Among those expressing shock that Roku had added Infowars to its lineup were lawyers for the families of victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., who have been threatened and harassed by people who believe the bogus theory spread by Mr. Jones that the massacre was a hoax. The company's announcement that it would yank the Infowars channel came hours after the lawyers publicly criticized Roku's move.
Social media platforms had vastly expanded Mr. Jones's audience for incendiary false claims, including, in addition to the Sandy Hook hoax, that the financier George Soros is a Nazi and that Democratic leaders operated a child sex ring from a Washington pizzeria.
News of Roku's Infowars channel had been reported on Tuesday by Digiday, and the company, a leading maker of streaming devices, initially defended Infowars's presence in its lineup, saying, "We do not curate or censor based on viewpoint."
Roku said at that point that "to our knowledge" Infowars had not violated Roku's policies "that prohibit the publication of content that is unlawful, incites illegal activities or violates third-party rights, among other things."
"If we determine a channel violates these policies, it will be removed," the company said earlier on Tuesday.
Mr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment.
He uses Infowars radio and online broadcasts to peddle diet supplements, survivalist gear and gun paraphernalia. The New York Times reported last year that the bulk of Infowars's revenue -- which was more than $20 million in 2014, according to court documents from that time -- came from the products Mr. Jones sells on the show.
For years, Mr. Jones spread bogus theories that the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting of 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook was a hoax, and the families of the victims were "actors." The resulting harassment by Infowars followers forced some of the families into hiding.
Victims' parents repeatedly pleaded with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other platforms to remove Infowars's content about the shooting. Last year, the families of 10 Sandy Hook victims filed three separate defamation lawsuits against Mr. Jones, who has maintained that he should be protected by the First Amendment.
Last week, a judge in Connecticut delivered a partial victory to the families of eight Sandy Hook victims, ruling that they must receive access to Infowars's internal documents, including letters, memos, emails and texts. The Connecticut complaint said Infowars profits by stoking paranoia to amass more followers, to whom it can sell more products.
The families of two more victims suing Mr. Jones in his home state, Texas, are demanding similar access to Infowars's internal records. Lawyers for the victims' families are also seeking to question Mr. Jones personally.
The lawyers blisteringly condemned Roku on Tuesday after the disclosure of Mr. Jones's channel.
Infowars's presence on Roku "interferes with families' efforts to prevent people like Jones from profiting off innocent victims whose lives have been turned upside down by unspeakable loss," Josh Koskoff, the lawyer representing eight Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut suit, said in a statement. "There is no amount of anticipated revenue that could possibly justify Roku's calculated decision."
Mark Bankston, the lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families suing Mr. Jones in Texas, called Roku "indifferent to the suffering caused by Mr. Jones's continued onslaught of cruelty and reckless lies."
Before its decision to join other social media platforms and ban Infowars, Roku made clear it was not promoting or being paid to distribute Mr. Jones's channel. "We do not have any commercial or advertising relationship with Infowars," Roku's earlier statement said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

To confirm William Barr, he must pledge to protect Robert Mueller: Today's talker

Texto completo: William Barr, President Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, will begin his confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Senators need assurances from Barr
By Caroline Fredrickson
What is a president to do when a federal criminal investigation is closing in around him? Put some friendly faces in charge.
Out with Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein, in with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and attorney general nominee William Barr.
Sessions famously incurred President Donald Trump’s wrath because he wouldn’t shield him against charges that the Trump campaign conspired with Russian officials to sway the 2016 elections. Rosenstein, similarly, irked the president by steadfastly protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Both men may have technically resigned, but it's the worst kept secret in Washington that their stands on the Russia investigation cost them their jobs.
Trump replaced Sessions with Whitaker as acting attorney general and nominated Barr to serve in the position full-time. Confirmation hearings begin Tuesday. Given the legal shroud hanging over this presidency — and the fate of those previously tasked with overseeing investigations into Trump’s conduct — it is vital that the Senate receive clear assurances from Barr that, if confirmed, he will remain independent of the president and allow the Mueller investigation to continue unimpeded.
Talker: The FBI is playing politics with Donald Trump
Barr has in the past downplayed the allegations made against the president and his campaign. And even though the Trump has said several times that the Russia investigation influenced him when he fired the man originally overseeing it, James Comey, Barr has said that the president made the right call.
Barr has also shown himself to be no friend of special counsel appointees from years past. He is alleged to have undermined the special counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, urging then-President George H. W. Bush to pardon several figures involved even as the investigation was progressing.
Trump and Barr are even said to have discussed the possibility of Barr serving as Trump's private defense attorney. That didn't happen, but it does provide a window into how useful Trump thought Barr might be with regard to the Russia investigation.
Trump is in legal jeopardy on many fronts. Several of his campaign cohorts are either in jail, have pleaded guilty or have been indicted. He is circling the wagons and obviously views the U. S. attorney general's office as a get-out-of-jail-free card.
During the confirmation hearings, senators must secure from Barr a commitment to let the Mueller investigation continue to its natural conclusion. They must seek answers from his testimony on several key issues (some of which Barr addressed in advance testimony released Monday):
►How will Barr impartially oversee Robert Mueller’s work?
►Will he commit to making Mueller's findings public?
►Will he resign if Trump demands he fire Mueller?
►Does Barr think presidential documents can be subpoenaed as the courts found in U. S. v. Nixon?
►Can a sitting president be indicted?
The American people deserve an attorney general who will uphold the rule of law and put their interests first. Any failure by Barr to clearly address any of the questions above should disqualify him from serving as the highest law enforcement officer in the land.
Caroline Fredrickson is the president of the American Constitution Society and author of the forthcoming "The Democracy Fix: How to Win the Fight for Fair Rules, Fair Courts, and Fair Elections". You can follow her on Twitter: @crfredrickson.
What others are saying
The New York Times, editorial: "It is William Barr’s approach to the investigation of the president that demands the most scrutiny. Under his view that the president controls Justice Department functions and can 'start or stop a law enforcement proceeding,' he may well be committed to the idea that the president can do as he wishes with the Mueller investigation. Would he be willing to resign if President Donald Trump tried to shut that investigation down, as Attorney General Elliot Richardson did when President Richard Nixon ordered him to fire the Watergate special prosecutor?"
Grant Woods, USA TODAY: "Sen. John McCain explained, 'The Constitution says that the Senate has the obligation to advise and consent. I am in keeping with the Constitution of the United States. When I got re-elected, I said I would support and defend the Constitution, I didn’t say I would support and defend the president of the United States. ' This is exactly how the Senate is supposed to work — and I hope senators treat Barr’s confirmation with the same urgency. A coequal branch of government should demand no less. "
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. , The Washington Post: "I will press him to demonstrate that he will be an attorney general committed to upholding the Constitution and applying the law without fear or favor. I will be looking for unequivocal commitments that he will respect the independence of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation; that he will ensure it receives all of the resources it needs; that he will not overrule Mueller’s decisions about indictments and prosecutions; and that he will not allow anyone, including the president, to interfere with or curtail the investigation. "
What our readers are saying
Special counsel Robert Mueller was given funds, staff and unlimited time to go after one person. I don't think these resources were given to investigate a crime.
— Jose Folenchez
I hope that William Barr keeps his word and doesn't let President Donald Trump interfere with making Mueller's report public. We're all waiting to see what's in it.
— Russell E. Glass
The Mueller report will be nothing more than a political hit piece against the president. The report should not be released to the public until the White House has had the opportunity to write a rebuttal. Then, the two reports should be released at the same time.
— Jim Reid
The fact that Barr says he wants Mueller's report made public and won't allow improper interference must terrify the liberals! I think the only thing keeping Mueller going is partisan liberal politics.

Texto completo: "Steve's remarks are beneath the dignity of the
party of Lincoln and the United States of America.
His comments call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity."
Kevin McCarthy
House Republican Leader
Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King was removed from his House committees Monday in the wake of comments he made last week about white nationalism and white supremacy.
"Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth," King said in a statement Monday night.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said Sunday he would take action after King told the New York Times: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
Many Republicans have spoken out against King's remarks, including Iowa Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst. Both had previously campaigned with King.
The decision to remove King from the judiciary, agriculture and small business committees metes out a punishment for the Kiron representative that is highly unusual but that McCarthy said is warranted.
McCarthy's office said the House Republican Steering Committee agreed to not seat King on any House committees when it issues its recommendations to assign members to committees.
"Steve's remarks are beneath the dignity of the party of Lincoln and the United States of America," McCarthy said in a statement. "His comments call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity. House Republicans are clear: We are all in this together, as fellow citizens equal before God and the law. As Congressman King's fellow citizens, let us hope and pray earnestly that this action will lead to greater reflection and ultimately change on his part."
Reports said the Republican Steering Committee unanimously decided to remove King from his committees.
"Ultimately, I told him 'You have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do,'" King said in a statement, apparently about his discussions with McCarthy. "I will continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years."
Iowans in the 4th District are used to drama around King.
Since he started representing Iowa in 2003, the conservative has faced criticism from national political figures and Iowans alike. Before the 2018 election, he faced denouncements after the Washington Post reported he met with a far-right Austrian group founded by a former Nazi SS officer following a trip funded by a Holocaust remembrance group.
But King still won the midterm election.
"My head is bloodied but unbowed," he said election night. "If they think this is going to intimidate me, they are going to find out otherwise."
Sioux Center conservative Jacob Hall said people in the district know King.
"There aren't many people left who don't have their minds made up about him," Hall said. "Barring him actually doing something, not just him saying something controversial, people aren't going to change their minds."
If you've met King, Hall said, you know that he's not a racist. But the Sioux Center Republican said he understands why there's been such backlash from national conservatives over last week's comment.
"This latest comment is the hardest one to kind of write off if you've never interacted with Steve King before," Hall said. "If you ever talk to Steve King, you understand he just kind of speaks off the cuff, he doesn't always finish one thought before starting the next thought some of the time. You can't always explain that to people."
Many 4th District voters have had conversations with King and spoken to him — which means they are less likely to be swayed by national coverage from the New York Times on King, he said.
But northwest Iowa may be ready for a different conservative to represent their district. In 2018, King won against Democrat J.D. Scholten by just over 3 percent — the closest margin he faced in years. In comparison, Gov. Kim Reynolds outperformed King by between 10.8 to 28.7 percent in 4th District counties.
State Sen. Randy Feenstra, who helped lead an effort last year to approve massive tax cuts in Iowa, said last week he'll seek the GOP nomination for King's seat. Bret Richards, an Irwin native, also announced he was joining the race.
"Steve's remarks are beneath the dignity of the
party of Lincoln and the United States of America.
His comments call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity."

SECOND REPEATING FAST RADIO BURST DETECTED IN SPACE

Texto completo: Far outside our Milky Way galaxy, something is causing repeating short bursts of radio waves to be released into space. Scientists have recorded the second repeating fast radio burst to be discovered, according to a study published last week in the journal Nature.
The finding was also presented at the 233rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle.
These radio bursts are only millisecond-long radio flashes, and such rapid bursts themselves aren't rare in space.
But this is only the second one that has been found to repeat. The mystery about why these bursts happen and where they come from continues, which always spurs believers to think that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations are creating them.
The first one, deemed FRB 121102, was discovered in 2015 by the Arecibo radio telescope, and it was revealed in 2018 that the bursts release an enormous amount of energy.
This new repeating fast radio burst is called FRB 180814.J0422+73 and was recorded six times coming from the same location, 1.5 billion light-years away.
This is one of the very first detections made by the new Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, or CHIME. The radio telescope was still in its pre-commissioning phase and operating with only a small amount of its full capacity in the summer of 2018 when it detected this and 12 singular fast radio bursts.
And although this new detection doesn't solve the biggest mysteries surrounding the radio bursts, the researchers who recorded it believe that other repeating fast radio bursts will be found -which could allow them to figure out where they originate.
One hypothesis is that powerful astrophysical phenomena are causing them. The first repeating fast radio burst was recorded at a frequency of 700 megahertz, but some of the bursts CHIME recorded were as low as 400 megahertz.
"[We now know] the sources can produce low-frequency radio waves and those low-frequency waves can escape their environment, and are not too scattered to be detected by the time they reach the Earth," Tom Landecker, a CHIME team member from the National Research Council of Canada, said in a statement. "That tells us something about the environments and the sources."

Your Airline's Plastic May Be Letting You Down

Texto completo: You've heard the pitch on your flights: Apply for an airline's credit card and get perks like waived bag fees, priority boarding and miles for every dollar you spend.
But what the airlines don't tell you is that it has become more difficult and more expensive to cash in your miles for upgrades or awards tickets. Those free bags are "free" only after you pay the credit card's annual fee, which generally starts at around $95.
"The way people talk about it is that it's a way to avoid these fees, but the fees are only there because of the airline," said Taylor Tepper, a senior writer at Wirecutter who recently analyzed various airlines' credit cards. "So the airline then wins, no matter what you do."
This month, Wirecutter, a consumer advice website owned by The New York Times, released a guide to travel credit cards. Its recommendation? The airline-branded cards typically aren't the best choice.
Mr. Tepper said that for many travelers, general-use credit cards like the American Express Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve were much better options. While their annual fees are high -- $550 for the American Express card and $450 for the Chase card -- they provide hefty credits that can be used with any airline to cover expenses like checked bags and in-flight purchases, along with other benefits like access to airport lounges.
Travelers must ultimately consider which benefits matter most to them. An airline-specific credit card could be the right choice if priority boarding and a free checked bag are primary concerns. But Mr. Tepper cautioned not to expect much else, even from a top-tier airline card.
"When it comes to getting elite status, you're not really going to get that with a credit card," he said. "If you are on an American flight three times a week and you're going all over the place, you're probably getting that elite status all by yourself."
And elite frequent fliers will usually get access to airline lounges and free checked bags whether or not they have the airline's credit card. It is possible to get elite status with some airline cards if you spend enough money, but the threshold is high -- $25,000 a year on Delta and United Airlines, for example. Otherwise, airlines require a minimum amount of flying each year to achieve frequent-flier status.
Most travelers will have to pay for a top-tier credit card if they want to maximize their benefits. Like the American Express and Chase Sapphire cards, the airlines' top cards usually cost at least $450 annually, and even the most expensive cards are rarely enough to bolster frequent-flier standing by themselves. So don't expect free upgrades to first class. Without frequent-flier status, you'll still have to use miles or pay cash for that bigger, more comfortable seat.
Prospects are even dimmer with airline credit cards that have lower annual fees. "You're not going to get elite status with these middle-tier cards," Mr. Tepper said.
Many travelers think it makes sense to use one airline's credit card if they fly mostly with that airline. "Delta flights, Delta credit cards, life is simple," Mr. Tepper said. But, he said, "those people would benefit more, on the whole, with the American Express Platinum Card."
He added, though, that airline-branded cards still had perks.
"You will benefit if you have a Delta card that gets you free checked bags," Mr. Tepper said. "If you travel twice, it will more than pay for your annual fee, so the loss is an opportunity cost."
Wirecutter found that the cards from some carriers, particularly Southwest Airlines, JetBlue and Alaska Airlines, offered better benefits to loyal fliers than other airline cards. New Southwest cardholders who enroll before Feb. 11 and spend $4,000 in the first three months will earn a companion pass, which allows them to choose one person to fly with them on any of their flights free for the rest of the year. But the pass will not be renewed next year, and there's a high point threshold to earn it again.
When comparing airline cards, travelers need to remember that the value of an earned mile isn't constant, either between carriers or over time, said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorksCompany, a consulting firm that focuses on the airline industry.
His company estimated, for example, that an award mile was worth 1.4 cents on Southwest Airlines in 2018 and 0.7 cents on American. That meant a traveler would have to spend 7,579 points for an average round-trip economy ticket on Southwest and 25,000 for a similar ticket on American.
Mr. Sorensen said he never spent miles on domestic economy tickets. He redeems his points only for international business class when the price is right.
Mr. Tepper agreed with that strategy. Miles, he said, are aspirational.
"It's getting something that you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford," he said. "If you redeem the points for a domestic flight, you're getting less value than you would if you redeem them for an international business flight."
General-use cards are more likely than airline cards to maximize the value of your points when you redeem them, Mr. Tepper said. "The value proposition of that is so great that you overcome the downside of missing out on some benefits of getting the airline card," he said.

The Paragraph That Pulls Readers Close to the Page

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The "lede" is the first paragraph of a newspaper story. It can be ponderous and downright dull. Or it can grab you by the lapels, pull you close and scream into your face: Read this.
On the National desk, we began a tradition recently of honoring the "lede of the week." We scrawl a particularly graceful lede in longhand on a white board that is visible to those coming and going from the newsroom. And we post the winning ledes on Twitter, where they regularly get loads of retweets.
The first winner was Tim Arango, a Los Angeles correspondent who wrote an article about how the images of the wildfires in California reminded him somewhat of his experiences covering war:
MALIBU -- A line of burned-out cars on the side of a road. The charred remains of an old pickup truck, brightened by a pristine American flag draped over the cab. Desperate residents fleeing, cars packed with people and family heirlooms, anything that could be frantically scooped up.
We then honored Campbell Robertson, a correspondent in Pittsburgh who wrote this about the dozens of Roman Catholic bishops around the country who have released lists of the priests in their dioceses who were credibly accused of abuse.
PITTSBURGH -- It was a list Charles L. Bailey Jr. had wanted to see for years: the names of the priests in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse who had been credibly accused of sexual abuse.
Another standout, by Mitch Smith, who is a Chicago correspondent, topped an article on the rash of thefts of baby Jesus statues from Nativity scenes:
BETHLEHEM, Pa. -- Away in a manger on Bethlehem's public square, a woman approached a statue of the baby Jesus one dark, December night. Then she stole it.
There were so, so many noteworthy ledes in 2018. Take this one from Dan Barry, who teamed up with a number of other national correspondents to document what life is like for migrant children in detention:
Do not misbehave. Do not sit on the floor. Do not share your food. Do not use nicknames. Also, it is best not to cry. Doing so might hurt your case.
Or this one from Vivian Yee, who was a national immigration correspondent before she went off to Beirut, and Miriam Jordan, who covers immigration from our Los Angeles bureau:
The youngest child to come before the bench in federal immigration courtroom No. 14 was so small she had to be lifted into the chair. Even the judge in her black robes breathed a soft "aww" as her latest case perched on the brown leather.
This week, we picked a new lede of the week on a story about a death row inmate who committed suicide. It said: "Unlike most death row inmates, Scott Raymon Dozier wanted to die." We credited the reporter who wrote the article, Rich Oppel, but he came over to the white board and crossed out his name and put that of the editor, Jamie Stockwell, who he said came up with the first paragraph.
To produce even more great ledes in the year ahead, I'm going to be convening some of those New York Times writers whose prose regularly shines bright to hear some of their secrets.
Besides Mr. Barry, whose has collected some of his signature pieces into a book, we'll hear from Sarah Lyall, who writes for numerous departments at The Times; Richard Fausset, our Atlanta bureau chief; and Jack Healy, who covers rural issues from Denver. We're also inviting Rachel Swarns, a longtime Times reporter who is now on contract with us; and Ellen Barry, the chief international correspondent based in London, who will be moving to the Boston bureau in the coming months. All of them have produced memorable ledes over the years, and their words of wisdom will undoubtedly result in even more.
Do you have a favorite?

Texto completo: Watch the new revival of "Roswell" on CW as the reboots keep on comin'. Or catch the Season 2 premiere of "Corporate" on Comedy Central.
What's on TV
ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO 9 p.m. on CW. This sci-fi series based on the young adult book series "Roswell High" gets a revival 20 years after its debut. Jeanine Mason ("Grey's Anatomy") stars as Liz, a native of Roswell, N.M., who returns home 10 years after leaving and discovers that her old crush, Max (Nathan Dean Parsons), has supernatural powers -- and he's not the only alien around. The show sticks to the original's main plot points, but retells them in the context of today's politics.
AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: THE SWAMP 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Not far from Miami lies Everglades National Park, a 1.5 million-acre wetland that is home to the American crocodile and the Florida panther. Today it is guarded as a mesmerizing tropical ecosystem, but more than a century ago entrepreneurs and politicians saw it as a useless swamp ripe for development. This documentary, loosely based on a book by the journalist Michael Grunwald, charts the disastrous consequences of repeated attempts to drain the Everglades and the work that led to President Franklin D.

Texto completo: Colleagues grow tired
of racial controversies,
approve concrete penalty
A panel of Republican leaders voted unanimously Monday to block veteran Rep. Steve King of Iowa from serving on House committees, a firm rebuke to an influential opponent of illegal immigration who sparked outrage last week after openly questioning whether the term "white supremacist" was offensive.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the decision by the Republican Steering Committee, which seats lawmakers on House committees, followed his own recommendation and was meant to send a message about the GOP at large.
"That is not the party of Lincoln," he said of King's comments. "It is definitely not American. All people are created equal in America, and we want to take a very strong stance about that."
Republican leaders had largely remained silent throughout King's campaign and election to a ninth term in November despite several inflammatory comments. The GOP decision to effectively strip him of posts on House Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business came as House Democrats weighed rebukes of their own and as leading Republicans spoke out against him.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said there is "no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind," while Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), a former presidential nominee, called on King to resign.
The recent controversy was touched off when King asked in a New York Times interview published last week, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
It followed a long string of remarks disparaging of immigrants and minorities, as well as a seeming embrace of far-right foreign politicians and parties that have been openly hostile to those groups.
King, in a statement, said: "Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth. . . . Ultimately, I told him, 'You have to do what you have to do, and I will do what I have to do.' " King did not speak to reporters after leaving an hour-long meeting with McCarthy on Monday evening, before the steering vote. The GOP conference must ultimately ratify the panel's committee selections.
House Democrats, meanwhile, could bring up a measure condemning King as soon as Tuesday. Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the party's No. 3 leader, on Monday said he would introduce a resolution to express "disapproval of Mr. King's comments and condemnation of white nationalism and white supremacy in all forms."
"I do so invoking the words of another King, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who, if he had been allowed to live, would be celebrating his 90th birthday" on Tuesday, he said on the House floor. "Dr. King counseled that, 'We are going to be made to repent, not just for the hateful words and deeds of bad people, but for the appalling silence of good people.' "
But for some Democrats, Clyburn's reproach of King - which would be similar to the action taken against Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) after he shouted "You lie!" at President Barack Obama during a September 2009 speech on health care - did not go far enough.
Assistant House Speaker Ben Ray Luján (N.M.), the fourth-ranking Democratic leader, called King's comments "blatantly racist" and said "every action we should take should be taken" and expressed support for a formal reprimand or censure.
"This needs to stop," he said. "Enough with him getting away with this stuff. This is nonsense."
Two Democrats - Reps. Bobby L. Rush (Ill.) and Tim Ryan (Ohio) - separately filed resolutions to censure King and indicated they would force a vote this week. Censure is a rare punishment for conduct bringing dishonor on the House, the most serious penalty short of expulsion.
King's words and actions have been a frequent subject of controversy, but never before have they prompted a concrete penalty.
Shortly before the November election, for instance, King lashed out at the media after The Washington Post reported that he had met with members of a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties after flying to Europe for a trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group. Republican leaders declined to comment.
This time, more Republicans spoke out, and last week a prominent state senator announced that he would seek to unseat King in the 2020 Republican primary.
Reacting to the loss of King's committee posts, the challenger, Randy Feenstra, said Monday that voters had "lost their seat at the table because of Congressman King's caustic behavior."
King is a figure of prominence in the House GOP, not only because of the controversies he has stoked but also as a former Judiciary subcommittee chairman, a leader in opposing legalized abortion and chairman of the Conservative Opportunity Society, an internal caucus of right-wing House Republicans that meets regularly. He secured Donald Trump's endorsement in his 2014 race.
After the Times interview was published, King issued a statement trying to clean up the controversy and later spoke on the House floor to say that he had made a "freshman mistake" by taking a reporter's call and that the comments were "snippets" taken out of context from a larger conversation.
That conversation, he said, was about "how did that language get injected into our political dialogue? Who does that? How does it get done?"
But members of both parties have become increasingly weary of the repeated cycle of offense and outrage surrounding King. Among those speaking out against King this time include Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, and Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), the most prominent black Republican in Congress.
McConnell on Monday became the highest-ranking Republican to speak out against King.
"I have no tolerance for such positions and those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms," McConnell said in a written statement to The Post.
Also Monday, the leader of the Anti-Defamation League called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and McCarthy to censure King and remove him as the top Republican on a House Judiciary subcommittee.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the group's chief executive and national director, said in a letter to the House leaders that it was the second time that he had made such a request.
"When it comes to Rep. King, we are beyond substantive disagreements. Rep. King has brought dishonor onto the House of Representatives," Greenblatt wrote. By censuring King, he added, "you will make clear that his actions were deeply offensive, wrong, and that the U.S. House of Representatives will not tolerate anti-Semitism or bigotry in any form."
Democratic leaders, managing a House majority, have been cautious in their comments on King. Censures of House members in the recent past have been done on a largely bipartisan basis following extensive investigations by the House Ethics Committee.
Pelosi on Monday left open the possibility that there could be votes on multiple punishments for King, ranging from disapproval to censure.
Rush said a serious response was warranted by King's repeated statements: "The U.S. Congress cannot be a platform for Steve King and those of his ilk. From Charleston to Charlottesville to Chicago to California, there is no home for this behavior, especially the floor of the United States House of Representatives."
"Anything short of censure," he added, "would be shallow."

Shame game targets Paul Ryan after Steve King loses committee posts

Texto completo: As Rep. Steve King lost his committee assignments, the knives came out for Paul Ryan.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and House Republicans voted Monday night to pull the plug on King, an Iowa Republican, in a sweeping rebuke of allegations that he showed support for white supremacy.

While McCarthy was showered in plaudits, several people in the political sphere took aim at Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who less than two weeks ago retired as House speaker, for not taking action against King during his tenure.

"McCarthy has done more in ten days to deter hate than Paul Ryan did in four years," tweeted Eric Schultz, who was a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama.

A number of journalists joined in on the pile-on in the first moments after the vote.
Tweet
Earlier in the day, the leader of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, name-checked Ryan, saying he wrote to the ex-Wisconsin congressman months ago to take action against King.

The man who campaigned to unseat King in the last election, former professional baseball player J.D. Scholten, also took a shot at Ryan on Monday. “Paul Ryan allowed him to be who he was for years,” Scholten told Vice News. “Maybe it’s the changing of the guard that needed to take place.”

Asked Monday evening why action was being taken by the GOP when King has made a number of offensive comments since he assumed office in 2003, McCarthy noted that he only just became leader.

"I have not been in Congress for those 16 years. I have just now become the leader of the Republican Party. Maybe I had not seen those, but I heard these. I disagree with these," he told reporters. "These are reckless, these are wrong, these are nothing associated with America and that's why I'm taking the action and the committee is as unanimously as we are."

The controversy began when King spoke with the New York Times last week and asked, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? ... Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?” Backlash was swift and bipartisan, with the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., issuing stern reprimands of King.

Over the past couple days, King did attempt some damage control, blaming the Times for mischaracterizing his comments and telling NBC News, “I reject white nationalism. I reject white supremacy. It's not part of any of my ideology. I reject anyone who carries that ideology."

As speaker, Ryan's go-to method of dealing with King's statements would be to condemn the message.

For instance, King appeared to criticize nonwhite foreigners and immigrants when he tweeted in 2017, "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies." Ryan was forgiving in an interview more than a day later. “I don't think that statement reflects what is special about this country,” he told Fox News. "I would like to think — and I haven't spoke to Steve about this — I would like to think he misspoke, and it wasn't meant the way it sounds, and I hope he's clarified that.”

In 2018, when King retweeted a neo-Nazi, Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, “The speaker has said many times that Nazis have no place in our politics, and clearly members should not engage with anyone promoting hate.”

Ryan left office earlier this month as Democrats took control of the lower chamber.

Texto completo: President Trump has a suggestion for the news media after a weekend of negative stories about his relations with Russia and other matters.

“The Fake News gets crazier and more dishonest every single day,” Trump tweeted Monday morning. “Amazing to watch as certain people covering me, and the tremendous success of this administration, have truly gone MAD! Their Fake reporting creates anger and disunity. Take two weeks off and come back rested. Chill!”


Trump's call for journalists to "chill" comes as the partial government shutdown is well into its fourth week. And in the aftermath of stories by the New York Times that the FBI once opened a probe into whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests, and by the Washington Post that the president has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In the last day, Trump also has hit back at congressional Democrats for taking vacations and visiting Puerto Rico as the shutdown continues and thousands of federal employees continue to be furloughed or forced to work without pay.

'Dirty cops:' Trump hits ex-FBI officials, Comey

Texto completo: President Trump on Monday chided former FBI officials who worked on the Russia probe, including ex-Director James Comey and one-time Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, calling them “dirty cops” and “known scoundrels.”

“The people doing that investigation were people that have been caught that are known scoundrels there,” Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for New Orleans. “I guess you could say they’re dirty cops.”

Trump specifically referenced Comey, McCabe and former FBI officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who were found to have exchanged derogatory text messages about Trump.

The president’s comment comes amid a New York Times report that after Trump fired Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation to examine whether Trump was working on behalf of Russia. Part of the investigation involved whether the president obstructed justice when he ousted Comey in May 2017.

Trump has long defended his decision to fire Comey and often takes to Twitter to criticize McCabe, Strzok and Page.

“What happened with the FBI, I have done a great service for our country when I fired James Comey, because he was a bad cop and he was a dirty cop,” Trump told reporters Monday. “He lied. He really lied.”

Texto completo: The House Republican leader said Sunday that he'll meet with Representative Steve King this week to discuss King's future in the party and promised action following the Iowa congressman's comments in defense of white supremacy.
"That language has no place in America. That is not the America I know, and it's most definitely not the party of Lincoln," said House minority leader Kevin McCarthy. "Action will be taken. I'm having a serious conversation with congressman Steve King."
King was quoted in The New York Times last week as saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" He has insisted he's an advocate for "Western civilization," not white supremacy or white nationalism. He said it was a 'mistake to use phrasing that "created an unnecessary controversy" and denied being racist.
McCarthy, on CBS's "Face the Nation," told host Margaret Brennan after the cameras were turned off that he is reviewing whether King, now serving his ninth term, should keep his committee assignments, according to CBS's transcript of the broadcast.
King serves on the Agriculture, Small Business, and Judiciary committees, and chairs Judiciary's subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil ­Justice.

How long can O'Rourke wait as 2020 pace picks up?
You won't see Beto O'Rourke announce whether he's running for president in 2020 for a while. But you may see him do almost anything else in the meantime.
"So, I'm here at the dentist," the former Democratic congressman said with a giggle during a teeth-cleaning seen live on Instagram last week, before quizzing the dental hygienist about life along the US-Mexico border.
Voters can catch O'Rourke on more traditional airwaves next month in New York, when Oprah Winfrey interviews him.
He barged into last year's Senate race almost laughably early, in March 2017, insisting he was a credible contender against the incumbent, Republican Ted Cruz, when almost no one nationally knew of O'Rourke. Now he's doing almost anything to keep people paying attention to him without formally starting a presidential campaign for 2020. He's not expected to decide until next month at the earliest whether he's running.
These days, that counts as playing hard to get. Influential activists in Iowa and elsewhere are clamoring for him to get in the race, while some potential rivals move their timelines earlier. So far, interest in O'Rourke has held after his near upset of Cruz, but for how much longer?
"They're not going to wait forever," Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, said of Democratic campaign operatives, donors, activists and fellow politicians looking to pick sides or offer endorsements. "The more candidates who start to formally launch their candidacies, the greater the pressure will rise on Beto."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on New Year's Eve that she'd formed a presidential exploratory committee, hoping to get an early jump on people such as O'Rourke, former vice president Joe Biden, and Senators Corey Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Kamala Harris of California.
Julian Castro, housing chief under President Barack Obama, kicked off his campaign Saturday and could appeal to the same Hispanic community that O'Rourke may count on as a bilingual native of the border city of El Paso.

Trump says 'weak' Biden came off the 'trash heap'
President Trump called former vice president Joe Biden a "weak" man when asked Saturday night about a growing list of Democrats seeking to topple him in 2020.
Trump, who prizes strength, attacks his enemies as weak, and has often resorted to name calling, resurrected previous insults against Biden as the former US senator from Delaware mulls his third presidential bid. He mocked Biden's two unsuccessful attempts for the White House and said former president Obama "took him off the trash heap" when he tapped Biden to be his vice president.
"He's weak. So we'll see what happens with him . . . Whoever it is, I think we're going to do just fine," Trump told Fox News's Jeanine Pirro.
Biden's spokesman declined to comment.
Trump made similar comments about Biden during an interview with CBS News in ­July, when he said that running against the former vice president would be a "dream."
Biden, 76, unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008.
Biden has previously taken a stab at Trump.
During a December interview with author and television personality Bruce Feiler, Biden acknowledged his reputation as a "gaffe machine" — a "wonderful" quality "compared to a guy who can't tell the truth."

Julián Castro says Trump has created a tragedy at border
2020 presidential contender Julián Castro said Sunday that President Trump has created a "tragedy at the border" with immigration policies that have separated children from their families.
Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and Obama administration housing secretary, promised to overhaul immigration laws when he announced his candidacy on Saturday. On Sunday, he slammed Trump for "playing games" with people's right to seek asylum and said the nation needs to get serious about recognizing this right.
"I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status solely," Castro said on CBS News's "Face the Nation." "We should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed and we're able to keep track of them in the country."
Castro said that as an alternative to deportation, he would "look at things like ankle monitors" to track where individuals are in the United States.
The Obama administration piloted such a program in 2016, but it was ended by the Trump administration, NBC News said.
If elected, Castro would be the country's first Latino president. He announced his plans to join the field of Democrats running for the party's 2020 nomination in San Antonio on Saturday. He laid out a platform that included making the first two years of college affordable, expanding Medicare to all Americans, and creating universal prekindergarten.
When pressed on how he would appeal to centrist Democrats with a largely progressive platform, Castro focused on health care.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I. — On the field, as long as you discount Sunday’s boat race against the Patriots, the 2018 season was an unqualified success for the Chargers. A 12-4 regular season, one playoff win, and a core of young, talented players suggest a bright future.
On the streets and in the boardrooms and living rooms of L.A., do people care?
The overnight TV ratings for Sunday’s Divisional Round playoff game in Foxborough were down slightly nationally (19.2), despite huge numbers in the Boston market. In L.A., the game drew a 17.2 rating. In San Diego it drew a 29.7, underlining the fact that it remains the home of the only group of football fans who still truly care about this franchise.
(I mean, hating is caring, right?)
This is, as we have been constantly told, a long-term play for the Chargers in Los Angeles. Playing in the recently renamed 28,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson was meant to transition the franchise into the market while building an audience and selling seat licenses for their tenancy in the stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood.
We are now two years into this adventure and there’s no going back. Dean Spanos told the New York Times last week, “There’s no doubt we are the Los Angeles Chargers. Los Angeles is our home.”
They’ve sold some seat licenses for the StanleyDome, shrewdly offering them for as little as $100 with the idea of ultimately positioning themselves as the people’s team.
Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests few people are buying it. How often do you see people wearing Chargers gear in public, for instance, compared to the number of people wearing Rams gear?
L.A. is an incredibly competitive sports market, and it takes time to create a niche. The Chargers had the misfortune of coming in a year after the Rams and their pre-existing history and legacy in L.A. They may still be digging out from the 0-4 start in their inaugural L.A. season, in terms of public perception.
Yes, winning does matter. But the Chargers’ success came the same season that the Rams were just a little bit hotter. And with the Chargers done, guess who has the L.A. football stage all to itself this week?
Whether the Spanos family likes it or not, this is still perceived in many quarters as a franchise that belongs to, and in, San Diego. Even now, two years in, the Lyft driver in Baltimore, the radio/podcast commentator in Cleveland, the occasional referee announcing a penalty and observers throughout the country still refer to the team as “San Diego.”
(Then again, during the wild card game in Baltimore last week referee Clete Blakeman slipped and declared that “San Francisco is charged with its first timeout” after an unsuccessful Chargers challenge. Yeah, we know, all those California teams are interchangeable.)
Consider this, going back to TV ratings: For much of the season, the Chargers’ L.A. ratings were in single digits and significantly trailed those in its former home. The Baltimore game last Sunday drew an 18.0 rating and 43 share in Los Angeles, a significant improvement … but in San Diego, split between those who still love the team and those who despise Spanos, the game drew a 30.7 rating and 60 share. Sunday against the Patriots was pretty much more of the same.
The ratings figure is deceptive, of course, because of the difference between a point in No. 29 market San Diego (10,028 homes, as measured by Nielsen) and No. 2 L.A. (53,186). Translated, 914,799 households in L.A. had the Patriots-Chargers game on, compared to 297,832 in San Diego.
Numbers can be crunched. Passion is harder to measure.
The San Diego Union-Tribune sent a reporter to New England this past weekend. San Diego TV people show up at home games and midweek availability in Costa Mesa. And there seems to be a constant debate in San Diego over how much that city’s media should pay attention to the city’s former team. Meanwhile, in L.A. it is one team among many and simply fighting for attention.
That shouldn’t be surprising at all. When this team played in San Diego, I had always maintained that with its low national profile, the only people who really, really cared about the Chargers resided in San Diego County, plus parts of Orange and Riverside counties. Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats on Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Trump's dealings with Russia, spurred on by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence inquiry into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.
Trump's Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia and denouncing as "ludicrous" any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.
The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-shattering fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without their salaries, missing their first paychecks of 2019 last week.

There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week.
Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.
In snowy Washington, the president called into a conservative talk show on Saturday night to denounce a report in the New York Times that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether the president was acting as an agent for Russia.
Asked by Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro whether he had ever "worked for Russia," Trump fumed but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked -- I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," he replied.
On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia after the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump's strenuous efforts to conceal what was said in face-to-face talks with Putin over the last two years.
Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, interviewed on "Fox News Sunday," called word of a counterintelligence investigation "alarming," and said it underscored the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to proceed unimpeded.
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that in order to open a counterintelligence investigation of a sitting president, the FBI must have had a "very deep level of concern."
With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.
Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump's "bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies."
In a statement issued Saturday night and tweeted out again on Sunday, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader -- to the extent of keeping his own national security team in the dark -- was of paramount concern.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," Engel said. "America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it."
Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump's demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side's only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.
Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union," Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), noted that "this is not a traditional president."
"He has unorthodox means," Johnson said. "But he is president of the United States. It's pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders."
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in earlier efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland -- but signaled that was about to change.
"Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter's notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin," he said in an announcement. "The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?"
Schiff, a former fed- eral prosecutor, added: "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first'?"
Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo, who is traveling in the Middle East, dismissed the possibility that Trump acted on Russia's behalf, calling it an "absolutely ludicrous" notion.
"The idea that's contained in the New York Times story, that President Trump was a threat to American national security, is silly on its face and not worthy of a response," he told CBS' "Face the Nation."
The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, said it was "curious" that as investigations were getting underway in 2017, "you had Vladimir Putin policies almost being parroted by Donald Trump."
Asked on "State of the Union" whether he thought Trump ever worked on behalf of the Russians and against American interests, Warner said: "That's the defining question of our investigation, and the Mueller investigation."
He added: "You had Trump say only nice things about Putin. He never spoke ill about Russia."
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump's staunchest defenders, suggested that the FBI's reported counterintelligence investigation pointed to malfeasance on the part of senior bureau officials.
"It tells me a lot about people running the FBI," Graham, a onetime Russia hawk, said on "Fox News Sunday" when asked about the Times report. He blamed news leaks by people "with an agenda."
Although Trump's purported toughness on Russia has been a major talking point among his defenders, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that he would force a vote on a resolution to disapprove of the administration's decision to ease sanctions on companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin announced plans to relax the sanctions last week.
Calling the Treasury Department's proposal "flawed," Schumer issued a statement Sunday urging the Senate to "block this misguided effort" by the administration. A simple majority would be needed to proceed.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), meanwhile, played down the latest Russia revelations as of little interest to anyone outside the nation's capital.
"Washington is obsessed with this," he said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Beyond the Beltway, the interstate highway ringing Washington, he said, "I don't find anybody concerned with this at all."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced this week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," said paper co-author Zeke Hausfather, in a statement on Thursday. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, who is a climate scientist with Carbon Brief.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters that records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
More: Antarctic ice melts to January record low
More: Greenland's ice sheet melt has 'gone into overdrive' and is now 'off the charts'
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
“Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!” the paper's authors wrote.
The new analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top climate change computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told the New York Times that the new research was “a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together. ”
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.

Where the investigations related to President Trump stand

Texto completo: A look at where the investigations related to President Donald Trump stand and what may lie ahead for him:
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
Trump is facing criminal investigations in Washington and New York.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia and whether the president obstructed the investigation. Trump also plays a central role in a separate case in New York, where prosecutors have implicated him in a crime. They say Trump directed his personal lawyer Michael Cohen to make illegal hush-money payments to two women as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the campaign.
___
WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW TODAY?
A published report said federal law enforcement officials were so concerned about Trump's behavior in the days after he fired James Comey as FBI director that they opened an investigation into whether Trump had been working for Russia against U.S. interests. The New York Times cited unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
Trump reacted with outrage during a telephone interview broadcast on Fox News Channel after host Jeanine Pirro asked whether he currently or has ever worked for Russia.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," he said. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing."
Trump went on to say that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
___
FORMER TRUMP LAWYER TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS
Cohen will testify publicly before a House committee next month. The House hearing could serve as the opening salvo in a promised Democratic effort to greater scrutinize Trump, his conflicts of interest and his ties to Russia.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee announced Thursday that Cohen will testify before that panel Feb. 7, a little more than a month after the Democrats took the House majority.
The hearing marks the latest step in Cohen's transformation from a trusted legal adviser to the president to a public antagonist who has cooperated extensively against him. It is likely to pull back the curtain on key episodes involving Trump's personal life and business dealings, including hush-money payments to women and a proposed Moscow real estate deal, that federal prosecutors have been dissecting for months.
___
SO ... DID THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA?
There is no smoking gun when it comes to the question of Russia collusion. But the evidence so far shows a broad range of Trump associates had Russia-related contacts during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition period, and several lied about the communication.
There is also evidence that some people in the president's orbit were discussing a possible email dump from WikiLeaks before it occurred. American intelligence agencies and Mueller have said Russia was the source of hacked material released by WikiLeaks during the campaign that was damaging to Hillary Clinton's presidential effort.
___
OTHER QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
—WHAT ABOUT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE? That is another unresolved question that Mueller is pursuing. Investigators have examined key episodes such as Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey and his fury over the recusal from the investigation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
—WHAT DOES TRUMP HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS? Trump has repeatedly slammed the Mueller investigation as a "witch hunt" and insisted there was "NO COLLUSION" with Russia. He also says his now-former lawyer, Cohen, lied to get a lighter sentence in New York.

Match-fixing remains issue after latest arrests

Texto completo: With the Grand Slam calendar set to begin Sunday with the Australian Open, tennis once again is dealing with allegations of match fixing at its lowest levels, a problem the sport cannot seem to shake.
Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, announced Thursday that the Spanish Civil Guard has arrested 83 people, including 28 professional tennis players, over their alleged involvement in fixing matches at Challenger and ITF Futures tournaments in Spain. Such events represent the second and third tiers of professional tennis, where unknown professional players toil at hundreds of barely noticed tournaments each year with hopes of acquiring the points needed to move up the rankings.
One of the arrested players took part in last year's U.S. Open, though Europol did not divulge any names.
"The suspects bribed professional players to guarantee predetermined results and used the identities of thousands of citizens to bet on the prearranged games," Europol said in a news release. "A criminal group of Armenian individuals used a professional tennis player, who acted as the link between the gang and the rest of the criminal group.
"Once they bribed the players, the Armenian network members attended the matches to ensure that the tennis players complied with what was previously agreed, and gave orders to other members of the group to go ahead with the bets placed at national and international level."
It's the second time in a little more than two years that law-enforcement officials have cracked down on match fixing on the Iberian peninsula. In December 2016, Spanish law enforcement officials detained 34 people, including six tennis players ranked between Nos. 800 and 1,200 in the world, alleging they were involved in a match-fixing network in Spain and Portugal. The players allegedly received about $1,000 per match for losing specific points or games in 17 Futures and Challenger tournaments in Spain.
Therein lies one of the reasons match-fixing is so prevalent at these lower-tier events: The prize money involved is often paltry, giving players an incentive to throw matches at tournaments in far-flung locales that few people are watching.
For instance, a 24-year-old Spaniard named David Perez Sanz won six titles on the ITF Futures Tour last year - five in Egypt and one in Sri Lanka - but took home less than $20,000 in tournament winnings for the year. For comparison's sake, Roger Federer received nearly $3 million alone for winning last year's Australian Open. Players who lost first-round matches at the U.S. Open received $50,000.
"You hear so many stories about other players getting approached," Laslo Urrutia Fuentes, an ITF Futures Tour player, told The New York Times last year. "They say when they are playing really weak players, someone says, 'Lose the first set and you will get $6,000.' "
According to an International Tennis Federation study cited by The New York Times last year, 6,000 of the 14,000 players who entered ITF Futures tournaments around the globe in 2013 didn't earn one cent of prize money. Only 336 men and 253 women out of the 14,000 broke even, when factoring in costs for travel and lodging.
"That's quite astonishing for a sport that has almost $300 million in prize money," Kris Dent, the ITF's senior executive director of professional tennis, told the Times. "These smaller tournaments have no TV, no sponsorships and no one paying any money to go see them, and they never will."
Last year, an Independent Review Panel - sanctioned by tennis's governing bodies - issued recommendations on tackling match fixing in a report that took more than two years to complete.
One of the proposals was to reduce the number of pro players at the sport's lowest levels to ensure that prize money "is better targeted to enable more of the men and women taking part to make a living." This year, the ITF is doing just that by putting the top 750 men and women into the Challenger Tour, where the prize money and opportunity for advancement are greater. The rest will play in something called the Transition Tour, which will still offer a pathway to tennis's higher ranks while offering more localized tournaments, cutting down on travel costs.
One level up, the Challenger Tour will increase the size of its singles draws to 48 from 32, creating 2,400 more spots per year. Plus, all Challenger tournaments will be required to supply players with hotel accommodations.
The sheer number of events at tennis's lower levels also can fuel match fixing. Players enter as many tournaments as they can, but if the next event on the schedule both offers more lucrative spoils and overlaps with their current tournament, it may give them incentive to tank.
"This is a significant, recurring problem at the lower levels of the tennis when doubles competitions, which are often viewed by players as less important or valuable, conflict with a singles event in the following week," the Independent Review Panel report said. "Players on occasion perceive themselves as better off losing and moving on than seeking to stay in a competition, and some act on that perception."
The report also recommended beefing up the Tennis Integrity Unity, which was established by the sport's governing bodies in 2008 but has been criticized as understaffed and ill-equipped to deal with the modern methods of match fixing.
In 2018, the TIU sanctioned 21 people for offenses such as match fixing, failing to report corruption and refusing to cooperate with its investigations, banning eight players and officials from the sport for life. Most of the sanctioned players had career-high rankings in the triple digits.
Even with reform, the rise of online gambling and the very nature of the sport make it ripe for match-fixing.
"The nature of the game lends itself to manipulation for betting purposes," the Independent Review Panel report said. "There are many contingencies. There is only one player who must act. Detection is difficult, not least because at many lower level matches there are no spectators and inadequate facilities to protect players from potential corrupters. Moreover, underperformance is often attributed to 'tanking,' which too often has been tolerated."

Texto completo: Let's make the future great again.
Do you remember when the future was great? I do. Technology was going to fix our problems, changing the way we all live, work and play.
That kind of utopian patter was big at the beginning of my career, when the hot new app was ... fire.
Over time, technologies changed but the overblown promises stayed. The internet was going to give us access to the best of the world's information. Music services like Napster would be an infinite jukebox, and all free! Social media would connect us with our friends and families (and their pets, and vacation snapshots) and usher in new waves of democracy around the world!
Google even started out with a beguilingly simple motto : Don't be evil.
We know how all that's worked out. A relatively small number of people got rich. And, one by one, many of the companies they started have proved to be -- well, if not outright evil, then less than entirely good. A familiar routine has emerged. Social media executives get dragged before Congress, apologize for privacy lapses, political manipulation and virulence, and promise to do better. Trust us, they say.
But I can't help but feel that these titans of industry are missing the point. They say they are sorry for committing blunders, but these aren't bugs in the system; they're the core of the business model.
Selling us out is, after all, just another kind of selling. No matter how they dress things up with rosy language, their real goal is making themselves, and their angel investors and venture capitalists, obscenely rich.
I'm not against obscene wealth, by any means, except for one question: How can I make obscene wealth part of my own future?
I do have a business plan: Be upfront about being evil.
Honesty, about my fundamental dishonesty, will be efficient. As a wicked tech overlord, I'll save so much time, once I'm drinking The Macallan and driving a McLaren, by never having to say I'm sorry -- to Congress or anybody else. From the get-go, I'll say what I'm doing is bad. The idea is so simple, so beautiful, that it amazes me that no social media magnate seems to have thought of it before.
Besides, consumers might appreciate honesty. I know. That's a crazy thought.
To beat the companies now dominating the market, I realized I'd have to understand them better. So I called Siva Vaidhyanathan, the director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia. He's also the author of "Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy."
Facebook, he said, makes us dumber as a society:" It "cuts and dices" experiences and serves them up as junk food for short attention spans.
Serious discussions? Boring. But generate strong, powerful passion and it's clickety click click, whether the issue is poor kids getting into Harvard or conspiracy theories about pizza parlors and pedophiles.
You can bet I was taking notes. This was quite an instruction manual.
I explained my plan to create a purely evil social network that will be unabashed about its badness. My company will peddle nothing but clickbait, especially nutty conspiracy theories.
Did you know that Hillary Clinton is having an affair with space aliens? They think she's likable! Also, Donald Trump has already built the wall, but you can't see it because it's INVISIBLE. Winning!
This stuff will be as rich in empty calories as a bag of potato chips and as addictive as cigarettes, but even worse for you. And those businesses are perfectly legal, so why not mine?
He didn't hang up on me, which has happened when I have tried to share my boldest ideas. But he told me I was too late.
At this point, he said, no one can start a big new social media platform because the current leaders are too well entrenched. He explained that Facebook, for one, has billions of users and tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue, not to mention more than a decade of valuable user behavior in its servers. "That kind of wealth of scale and data is insurmountable," he said.
Fine. The do-evil approach can work in businesses beyond social media.
Banking is a great field. I will come up with a mobile app that lets you know right from the start that we are going to sign you up for accounts and lines of credit you don't want but for which you will pay hefty fees.
We will persuade people to accept this abuse by explaining that we are utterly incompetent -- so hapless that we might just forget your mortgage, so you get a free house. Banks have done these things before, but they have lacked evil transparency -- and that's my motto.
Even if I don't create an entirely new social media network, there are always opportunities for evil consultants.
Sites like Twitter are already littered with vicious insults, but they are just so amateurish. I will create a personalized service that is thoroughly professional, using insult comedians along the lines of Don Rickles. People like Lisa Lampanelli and Vinnie Favorito will beam individualized abuse right to your cellphone.
Good Americans already pay for this kind of thing in Vegas. But we will abuse them online, in their pajamas. Wait. The customers will be wearing their own pajamas. But you get what I mean.
Looking for more insights, I called Anand Giridharadas, author of "Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World." I tried to explain my concept, but he misunderstood. "There's just an amazing play out there for a tech company that actually wants to do what tech companies say they are about," he said.
No, no, no, I explained. I just want to be honest about being bad. He pondered and turned his argument around with remarkable agility.
"I would so appreciate companies that were straightforward about their predation, and I would have respect for them," he said. Of course, he said, Washington would need to regulate my evil entity.
That was disappointing. But he had a helpful suggestion.
When I strike it rich, I can take my place among the plutocrats who buy halos through charitable giving, which he called "humanitarian gloss and phony world changing."
I liked the sound of that, the phony part especially, and will definitely earmark a small portion of my first billion for pretending to make the world a better place. I can be magnanimous. But I'll be open about my core business: It is evil. And I'd even go public with it.
That way, as my hero, Milo Minderbinder, put it in the great how-to book "Catch-22," everybody can have a share.
If you need me, I'll be on Twitter, yelling at somebody.

Texto completo: The agency pursued criminal and intelligence investigations in 2017
The FBI investigation into President Trump that was opened almost immediately after he fired then-Director James B. Comey also included a counterintelligence component to determine if the president was seeking to help Russia, and if so, why, according to people familiar with the matter.
The decision by then-acting FBI director Andrew McCabe to open an investigation of a sitting president was a momentous step, but it came after Trump had cited the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election in his decision to fire Comey, these people said.
The counterintelligence component of the Trump investigation was first reported by the New York Times.
Late Saturday night, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro asked Trump in an interview if he is or ever was working for Russia. Trump responded, "I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked." Referring to the New York Times story, he went on, saying, "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written."
Trump earlier responded Saturday morning on Twitter, blasting former FBI leaders, criticizing their handling of an earlier investigation into Hillary Clinton and ripping the ongoing Russia probe. Trump has repeatedly denounced the FBI and Justice Department in such harsh terms, underscoring the gulf between the White House and the nation's top law enforcement agencies in his administration.
"The corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" the president tweeted. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop."
McCabe was fired last year, and a grand jury is weighing possible charges against him for allegedly misleading investigators in a leak probe.
Counterintelligence investigations are different from criminal probes, in that their chief purpose is to understand what a foreign adversary like Russia is trying to do to influence American society or counteract U.S. policies, and if any Americans are assisting in those efforts, either knowingly or unwittingly.
In the case of the investigation into Trump, the FBI's decision to open a file on the president so quickly after Comey's firing in May 2017 was a source of concern for some officials at the Justice Department because the FBI acted without first consulting leadership at the department. But those worries were allayed when, days later, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was appointed to oversee the Russia probe, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations.
At the time the FBI began directly investigating Trump, it wanted to understand if he was attempting to obstruct justice by firing Comey and understand the reasons for his behavior, which also included comments in an NBC interview two days after Comey's dismissal.
In that interview, Trump said, "When I decided to just do it, I said to myself - I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.' "
In addition to that statement, top bureau officials were also concerned about a draft letter to Comey that Trump had wanted to deliver but never did - with a belligerent and defensive tone - that made repeated references to Comey's private statements to Trump that he wasn't personally under investigation in the Russia probe, according to people familiar with the matter.
"The FBI sees [these actions] and it has two jobs: It needs to try to figure out why the person is behaving that way - that's the counterintelligence part - and it needs to suss out whether that behavior is criminal in nature," one official said. "It is hard to overstate how devastated the leadership of the bureau was when Comey was fired - not because they loved him, although many in the FBI did love him - but because it completely broke so many norms and appeared to be a move that had nothing to do with Comey and everything to do with the president's own interests."
The official said that the counterintelligence and criminal inquiries were always linked.
Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the revelations are disturbing. "A lot of the behavior which has sent people to jail - largely about lying about Russia - occurred before the firing of Comey," he said in an interview. "So if the FBI had concerns that the president was wittingly or unwittingly acting in the Russians' interests as late as the firing of Jim Comey, that's a pretty scary thought - especially since we don't know what else they [the investigators] know."
He added that "the FBI opening any investigation is a highly documented, well-considered and well-reviewed process. This one would have been particularly carefully undertaken."

PRESIDENT EYES TAKING MONEY FROM CALIFORNIA FLOOD PROJECTS TO PAY COSTS

Texto completo: President Trump is considering taking more than $2 billion already approved by Congress for flood control projects in California to help fund the building of his controversial border wall, according to a Democratic lawmaker.
Rep. John Garamendi, D-Fairfield, said in an interview Friday that the Army Corps of Engineers presented a list of funded but unbuilt projects including new levees to protect homes, schools and businesses on San Francisco Bay's shoreline in North San Jose to the president as he headed to Texas on Thursday to bolster his case for a $5.7 billion border wall.
The corps list that Garamendi's office provided to this news organization highlighted projects in California and Puerto Rico from a list of $13.9 billion in flood control and disaster relief efforts in states including Texas, Florida, West Virginia and Louisiana. It includes $2.47 billion that had been approved in California for flood control projects along the American and Yuba rivers near Sacramento, Lake Isabella in Kern County and the Santa Ana River in Southern California.
Bay Area officials said Friday that they are stunned by the possibility that money already approved by Congress for an important flood control project on San Jose's shoreline could somehow be shifted to Trump's wall project.
The project would build 4 miles of new levees around Alviso and nearby areas over the next four years to protect flood-prone communities in major winter storms and as the bay's water level continues to rise from climate change.
"This bothers the hell out of me," said Dick Santos, a member of the Santa Clara Valley Water District. "I will do everything I can to protect that money."
The White House press office did not respond Friday to questions about the list of Long Term Disaster Recovery Investment Plan projects funded under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and signed into law by Trump last year.
Garamendi, a former California lieutenant governor and insurance commissioner, sits on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which oversees federal water projects. Asked how he knew the highlighted projects on the list were candidates for diverting funding for a border wall, Garamendi said: "A little birdie told me so. There are ways we find out what's going on."
"Each of these projects are essential for the preservation of life and property," Garamendi said.
The New York Times also reported late Thursday that the White House had "directed the Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether it can divert for wall construction $13.9 billion allocated last year," citing Defense Department and congressional officials who insisted on anonymity.
The idea didn't sit well with Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress from California. Parker Williams, communications director for Rep. Doug LaMalfa, RRichvale, said, "Congressman LaMalfa has already expressed concern with this idea, and he believes that any move would need careful consideration before acting on it."
Garamendi said Congress had authorized and appropriated money for the listed projects but the work had not yet been contracted out, so the funding was considered "unobligated." He also noted that the only identified projects were in California and Puerto Rico, while those in Republicanled states were untouched.
"There's a political dynamic in play here," Garamendi said. Trump, after saying all week he was considering declaring a national emergency to try to push through border wall funding without congressional approval, seemed to back off Friday, but left the door open.
"What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency," Trump said Friday afternoon, flanked by law enforcement officials at a White House press event. "I'm not going to do it so fast."
But that did little to comfort California officials' concerns that their water projects are off the hook.
Santos noted that the $177 million South Bay Shoreline Project has been in the planning stages for years, and that work has been scheduled to start this summer.
The new earthen levees, which are planned to be 15 feet high, replacing old levees that are roughly 5 to 10 feet high, is part of ongoing restoration efforts to convert former Cargill industrial salt ponds in the South Bay back to tidal marshes for fish and wildlife.
"That project is vital for Silicon Valley," Santos said Friday. "It protects the wastewater treatment plant, Levi's Stadium, medical facilities, schools, tech companies and the homes of thousands of people. We're trying to avoid becoming another New Orleans after Katrina."
Sam Schuchat, executive officer of the California Coastal Conservancy, a state agency based in Oakland that has been working closely on the project with the water district and the corps, said it would be "outrageous" if Trump tried to shift money that Congress approved for flood projects last year.
"We've been working on this since 2002," he said. "This area is 15 feet below sea level. They had a huge flood in the 1980s. Alviso is probably the most at-risk place along San Francisco Bay for flooding. People die in floods, and property is destroyed."
Schuchat said that his agency is exploring every option to keep the money, including speeding up the process to sign contracts with construction companies, because once contracts are signed, it becomes much more difficult to take away the funding.
The other projects include long-planned work to reduce flood risk in the Sacramento area and Central Valley, including finishing a levee around Marysville, a flood-prone area in Yuba County, raising Folsom Dam and expanding flood protection on the American River to reduce risk in Sutter and Sacramento counties.
Democrats say that they support border security but have refused Trump's requested $5.7 billion funding for a border wall, a core campaign pledge that they consider a waste. The resulting standoff with the president, who has refused to sign spending bills without it, has left much of the federal government shuttered for what will become a record duration of 22 days today.
With no sign of compromise in the works despite mounting pressure on both sides to reopen the government, Trump has repeatedly suggested he could declare an emergency at the border and use that authority to divert unspent funds for a border wall.
Congressional Democrats said they will fight any move to shift the money.
"Congress allocated these taxpayer dollars for vital flood protection projects all over the country, including projects that safeguard Sacramento and over half a million of my constituents," Democratic Rep. Doris Matsui of Sacramento said in a statement to the Sacramento Bee on Thursday night. "It's unconscionable that President Trump wants to take Sacramento's flood protection funding away to build his border wall, which he repeated, time and time again, that Mexico would pay for."

Let the sealing begin

Texto completo: Pennsylvania state court officials are preparing a massive initiative that could pave the way for courts across the country to offer people convicted of minor offenses a fresh start outside the shadow of their past.
In late June, Pennsylvania officials plan to begin running a computer program that will flag an estimated several hundred thousand old non-violent misdemeanor and summary convictions as well as cases that did not result in convictions for removal from the public record under the state's new Clean Slate law.
The law -- the first of its kind in the nation -- passed the General Assembly last summer with only two no votes.
The law is designed to help people who did their time, paid their fines, stayed out of trouble and found themselves facing hurdles to housing and employment as the result of an old record, said attorney Tom Farrell, vice chairman of the Allegheny County Bar Association's criminal defense section.
"We have people 50 or 60 years old who have been in jobs forever, and in the 1970s or 1980s they were involved in something and had a conviction (and) no one knew about it. Now the company is getting bought out and the new owners want to run a background check on everyone, and they're back to square
one," Farrell said. "We heard from one person who was working in a place where they fire people with any kind of theft, and that person was scared to death because they actually did the firing and had a theft record from way back when."
How it works
Criminal records have always been a public record. Until the advent of online court dockets, however, those wishing to access them had to visit the courthouse where they were kept.
Pennsylvania's unified online court dockets made it simple for anyone to check old records. Short of hiring an attorney and persuading a judge to expunge the record, even charges that did not result in a conviction became available online for anyone to see with a few keystrokes.
Under the Clean Slate law, records flagged by the court will be sent to the Pennsylvania State Police. The police agency must sign off on moves to seal records. Records will not be destroyed, only removed from the public docket.
And those thousands of paper records filed away in courthouses across the state? Well, it's not exactly clear how they will be handled.
The office of Westmoreland County Clerk of Courts Bryan Kline dockets about 6,500 to 6,600 criminal cases a year. He said he's been led to believe his office will continue to maintain the physical files but that they will not be available to the public.
All of the sealed files will remain accessible to law enforcement agencies.
The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts is scheduled to begin running an automated program to flag files for sealing on June 28. Officials warn they may not get through the backlog in the first year.
In the meantime, people whose records are eligible for sealing may petition the courts to act immediately.
Wide support
Greensburg lawyer Tim Andrews, a former assistant district attorney, said he has already had many inquiries about it. Andrews said the new law should not harm anyone. But it will allow some people who made a mistake as a young adult to move forward.
Sharon Dietrich, the Community Legal Services lawyer who penned the Clean Slate law, works in the office's employment section in Philadelphia. She said the office has heard from 10,000 people dealing with such issues over the past several years.
"And that's probably just the tip of the iceberg," she said.
Dietrich said the estimated volume of cases eligible statewide is so large that the only thing that could make it work is automation.
In many states, each county has a separate computer system. But Pennsylvania, with its unified court system, has a single computer system that can tackle the project. Even so, Gov. Tom Wolf, one of the law's most ardent supporters, warns the start-up will be complicated.
Special interest groups as diverse as the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity on the right and the left-leaning Center for American Progress have lauded the Clean Slate Act.
More help needed
Pennsylvania legislators passed the law as state and federal lawmakers across the country tackled various aspects of criminal justice reform, ranging from reducing tough mandatory minimum sentences to addressing job training and education to prepare inmates for release in the hope of reducing recidivism.
In New York, state lawmakers passed a similar law that extended the opportunity to have a record sealed to individuals with a single felony. Unlike Pennsylvania, where all cases eventually will be flagged automatically, New York required people to petition the courts.
As of May, when the law had been on the books for seven months, the New York Times found that the records of only 346 people had been sealed.
"When it's not automatic, people may not know that the opportunity exists and people are left with the burden -- and potentially the cost of trying to hire a lawyer -- to submit a sealing application," said Alison Wilkey, public policy director at the Prisoner Reentry Institute at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
"Briefly, these sealing initiatives are an incredibly important way of expanding opportunity for the 70 million Americans who have criminal records. We all believe in redemption, but people who have been arrested or convicted of a crime are punished for life even though they have served their sentence and paid their debt to society. This means people have a problem getting jobs, supporting their families and finding housing," Wilkey said.
Some say reformers are only beginning to recognize the impact of laws that fed the explosion of Pennsylvania's prison population from 7,600 in 1979 to 47,370, four decades later.
New Kensington defense attorney Dan Joseph, who began practicing law at the beginning of that era, said the Clean Slate law is a small start.
Joseph said prosecutors could have an impact without changing the law by simply thinking twice about whether to charge a crime as a felony on a first offense. Unlike misdemeanors, felonies are not eligible for sealing under the new law.
"One of the problems we have right now is these young people get tabbed with felonies and it haunts them the rest of their lives. Felonies are tossed around like they don't matter in court," Joseph said.
Prosecutors often have an option to file a misdemeanor instead, he said.
"I always ask, 'Why do you want the felony when you could use your discretion and go for the misdemeanor?'" Joseph said. "And why not make the wait (for Clean Slate eligibility) five years instead of 10?
"To me, the Clean Slate is like a piece of salt on a mountain of what needs to be done to allow people to get their lives back once they've done their time."

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand appears all but certain to launch a 2020 presidential campaign soon.
Gillibrand, a Democrat, has keyed in on the Rensselaer County city of Troy as a potential headquarters for a 2020 campaign, not far from her home in Brunswick, The Associated Press reported Thursday.
Next weekend, Politico reports Gillibrand is planning on traveling to Iowa, whose presidential caucuses are a key first step in the primary season.
And she has been staffing up for a potential bid, selecting a campaign manager, communications directors and other key positions for the coming campaign, according to various reports.
A spokesman for Gillibrand did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
Gillibrand has been publicly mulling a presidential run since cruising to re-election in November.
She is expected to formally announce her run in the coming days or weeks.
Long rumored to have aspirations for higher office, she first publicly confirmed she was considering a 2020 bid on Nov. 8, two days after she winning re-election in New York.
"I believe right now that every one of us should figure out how we can do whatever we can with our time, with our talents to restore that moral decency, that moral compass and that truth of who we are as Americans, so I will promise you I will give it a long, hard thought of consideration," Gillibrand said then on CBS' "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."
Gillibrand, 52, has been New York's junior senator since 2009, when she was selected by then-Gov. David Paterson to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had become secretary of state.
She's been easily re-elected three times since then — in 2010, 2012 and 2018.
Prior to that, she was a congresswoman representing an Albany-area district from 2007 until she was appointed senator.
Gillibrand's apparent run comes despite repeatedly pledging to serve a full six-year term in the Senate, which would run through 2024.
Her most public pledge came during an October 2018 debate.
"I will serve my six-year term," she said then.
That led to a quick rebuttal from Republican opponent Chele Farley: "Honestly, I don't believe that."
The New York Times reported Friday that Gillibrand had hired Meredith Kelly, a former spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Schumer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as her 2020 communications director.
Her campaign staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her chief of staff in the Senate, and Dan McNally, who worked for Senate Democrats, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Both reports cited unnamed people who were familiar with the hirings.

More women seek divorces in conservative West Africa

Texto completo: MARADI, Niger - He didn't hit her. He didn't yell. He didn't cheat, as far as she knows. It was just that, less than two years into their marriage, Zalika Amadou's husband had changed. He'd become far too neglectful and indifferent for a young woman who expected, well, more.
Her mother, who had gotten married at 14 to a stranger twice her age, couldn't understand the fuss. She'd stuck with her husband for five decades until he died.
But for Amadou, who married at 16, simply having a husband was not enough. So, on a busy morning in Maradi, Niger, she sat in front of a judge at a crowded Islamic court on the sidewalk and asked for what young women across the region are seeking like never before: a divorce.
For centuries, women have been expected to endure bad marriages in many conservative pockets of West Africa. Divorce happened, but most often the husbands were the ones casting off their partners.
"It's the end of the world when a husband and wife don't stay together," said Amadou's mother, Halima Amadou.
But here in Niger, a place where women have less education, lower living standards and less equality with men than just about anywhere else in the world, a quiet revolution is playing out.
Many women like Amadou come to this sidewalk court every month to push for a divorce, frustrated not only by their husbands' inability to earn a living during a time of economic hardship, but also because their basic views on relationships have changed.
They want to choose whom and when to marry, not be pushed into marriages. They demand respect and, better yet, love. And when their husbands fall short, women are the ones driving this new culture of breakups.
"Young women now go into marriages with certain expectations," said Alou Hama Maiga, secretary-general of the Islamic Association of Niger. "If these expectations are not met at some point, then divorce is inevitable."
The Islamic judge who presides over the streetside religious court in Maradi, Niger's third-largest city, said that divorces initiated by women had doubled in the past three years, with nearly 50 women a month coming to end their marriages.
"These young women don't want to suffer any more," said the judge, Alkali Laouali Ismael. "There is a solution to their problems, and they know they can find it here."
Lawyers, women's associations, local officials and academics who study the region say the increase is happening across West Africa - in urban and rural, as well as Muslim and Christian, areas - as women assert more control over their relationships.
The total divorce rate is relatively stable or even declining slightly in some parts of West Africa, they note, but underneath that are huge changes in divorce patterns and society at large.
Women are more educated now and in some areas marry later in life, factors that academics say lead to more stable marriages. At the same time, more women are moving into cities and joining the workforce, empowering more of them to discard bad marriages.
Dakar's Association of Female Lawyers said it now helped three times as many female clients seeking divorce as it did even just four years ago.

Amazon’s Ring videos from inside customers’ homes viewed in cybercrime hotbed: reports

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon’s Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely — but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that’s a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times’ popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring’s video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: “A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers’ video streams or recordings.”
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring’s mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, “the company’s treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but.”
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team “virtually unfettered access” to “every video created by every Ring camera around the world,” according to The Intercept.
“The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers,” the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company’s image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
“A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring’s video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors,” The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
“The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing.”
The site’s reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team’s location.
“The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime,” according to The Information. “If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone’s home.”
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees’ viewing of video, according to The Intercept. “Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example,” the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers’ personal information very seriously.
“These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes,” the spokesperson said.
“Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products.”
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, “anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them.”
According to The Intercept, Ring describes “Neighbors” — a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras — without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that “those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab.”
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, “you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors,” the site reported.

ALPHABET SUED OVER HUSH' SPENDING

Texto completo: Google parent company Alphabet's board of directors cost the firm billions of dollars by covering up sexual abuse by senior executives and paying them millions as they were quietly ousted, a new lawsuit by a shareholder claims.
Shareholder James Martin is suing the Alphabet board and senior executives, including two who allegedly received huge payouts as they were forced out of the company over claims of sexual misconduct.
A lawyer for Martin claimed Thursday that the board's response to sexual harassment allegations cost the company a $90 million severance package to Android creator Andy Rubin, accused of coercing a female Google employee into oral sex, plus millions more in severance for Search chief Amit Singhal, who was accused of drunkenly groping a female Googler at an off-site event.
A worldwide walkout in November by thousands of Google employees, in response to revelations in the New York Times about Rubin's alleged golden parachute, cost Google hundreds of millions of dollars beyond the executives' payouts, and fallout from the purported scandal led to billions of dollars in losses to Alphabet's value in the stock market, lawyer Frank Bottini said at a press conference in San Francisco.
Alphabet's market capitalization was about $760 billion just before the New York Times article on Rubin was published, and as of Thursday was $748 billion.
Internal probes found sexual misconduct claims against Rubin and Singhal credible, the lawsuit alleged. The suit also cited reports of previous sexual misconduct by senior Googlers.
"The conduct of Rubin and other executives was disgusting, illegal, immoral, degrading to women, and contrary to every principle that Google claims it abides by," the lawsuit claimed.
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit, filed Thursday morning in San Mateo County Superior Court. Rubin in an August tweet dismissed as a "smear campaign" the claim that he had coerced a woman into sex in a hotel room. Singhal could not be immediately reached for comment.
Google said late last year it had fired 48 people in the previous two years for sexual harassment, including 13 who were senior managers or above, and none received severance packages.
Martin's lawyers said the lawsuit was based on minutes from board meetings, which were obtained from Alphabet on the condition that the contents be kept confidential. Details of allegations are redacted from public court filings.
Alphabet's directors paid Rubin "handsomely" to "ensure his silence," the suit claimed, "since they apparently feared that if they fired Rubin for cause, he would sue Google for wrongful termination and all the tawdry details of sexual harassment by senior executives at Google would become public."
Rubin, according to the lawsuit, was also found to have had bondage videos on his work computer at Google, and the company "merely docked Rubin's bonus slightly," the lawsuit claimed.
While senior male executives accused of sexual misconduct at Google received hefty golden parachutes, Alphabet employed a double standard for discipline, the lawsuit alleged.
"If you were a high-level male executive at Google responsible for generating millions of dollars in revenue, Google would let you engage in sexual harassment. And if you get caught, Google would keep it quiet, let you resign, and pay you millions of dollars in severance," the suit claimed. "If you were a low-level employee at Google and were accused of sexual harassment or discrimination, you would be fired for cause with no severance benefits."
The lawsuit and a similar one reportedly filed Wednesday come amid the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct toward women. Lawyers for Martin said they hoped the suit would generate effects beyond Google. "There really needs to be a massive change not only at Google but also many Silicon Valley companies, where we know it's the same old boys' club even today, even after all the MeToo that has transpired," said lawyer Ann Ravel.

Texto completo: A very Happy New Year again to you and yours. I wish you all of the health, wealth and good food you can stand. Cheers!
Like most people who "went in" (again) during the holidays, we are all trying to start anew and recalibrate the system. That means (re) starting a workout plan, eating less and eating healthier foods, and sometimes just setting an intention to take care of our vessels.
In the spirt, a good friend and neighbor made her healthy resolution to cook more, try new recipes and share with friends. I am thankful she did because I would not have known about the social media food craze, #thestew, from @A1isonERoman of The New York Times.
Spiced chickpea stew with coconut and turmeric turned me out so much, you (and all those non-social media followers) deserve to make it for yourself.
¼ Cup olive oil, plus more for serving
4 Garlic cloves, chopped
1 Large yellow onion, chopped
1 (2-inch) Piece ginger, finely chopped
Kosher salt and black pepper
1½ Teaspoons ground turmeric, plus more for serving
1 Teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
2 (15-ounce) Cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 (15-ounce) Cans full-fat coconut milk
2 Cups vegetable or chicken stock
1 Bunch Swiss chard, kale or collard greens, stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces
1 Cup mint leaves, for serving
Yogurt, for serving (optional)
Toasted pita, lavash or other flatbread, for serving (optional)
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion and ginger. Season with salt and рзррег and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is translucent and starts to brown a little around the edges, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add turmeric, red-pepper flakes and chickpeas, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they've started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove approximately a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish.
Using a wooden spoon or spatula, further crush the remaining chickpeas slightly to release their starchy insides (that will help thicken the stew). Add coconu: milk and stock to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer scraping up any bits tha: have formed on the bottom of the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until stew has thickened and flavors have started to come together, 30 to 35 minutes. Taste a chickpea or two, not just the liquid, to make sure they have simmered long enough to taste as delicious as possible. If after 30 to 35 minutes you want the stew a bit thicker, keep simmering until you've reached your desired consistency.
Add greens and stir, making sure they are submerged in the liquid. Cook a few minutes so they wilt and soften, 3 to 7 minutes* depending on what you're using. Swiss chard and spinach will wilt and soften much faster than kale or collard greens. Season again with salt and pepper.
You will not be disappointed with this vegetarian bowl of heaven!
Happy eating and thanks for reading!

Texto completo: Robert Mueller’s team met with and sought information from one of President Trump’s campaign pollsters last year.

CNN reporters say they saw pollster Tony Fabrizio, a former business associate of Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort, leaving the special counsel’s office in February 2018 and have confirmed that he was meeting with Mueller’s team.

Manafort’s attorneys revealed earlier this week that Mueller was interested in gaining insight into how he shared polling data.

Fabrizio previously worked with Manafort in relation to his lobbying work in Ukraine and in the spring of 2016 became Trump’s head pollster.

In failing to properly redact a court filing this week as part of Mueller's Russia investigation, Manafort's defense team revealed that he shared polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian-Ukrainian political consultant with links to Russian intelligence.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that Manafort also directed then-deputy Trump campaign manager Rick Gates to provide the polling data to Ukrainian oligarchs Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov.

Texto completo: I made a whopper of a mistake Tuesday night by watching President Trump deliver that lame nine-minute defense of his “manhood” issue (the Wall) when I could have instead watched Stormy Daniels in her underwear, folding laundry.
I am not making this up: Daniels, the porn star who has said she had a famous sexual encounter with Trump, livestreamed herself folding her laundry, including her red thong.
Before Trump began his address from the Oval Office, Daniels went on Twitter to announce: “If you’re looking for anything even remotely worth watching tonight at 9 p.m. EST, I will be folding laundry in my underwear for eight minutes on Instagram live.”
When I read about Daniels’ stunt in the New York Times Wednesday morning, I immediately went to YouTube and checked her out. Yep, there she was, sitting on her bed in a revealing purple bra and matching panties as she meticulously folded her “Penthouse” leggings, a Freddie Mercury T-shirt, her blue jeans, socks, cut-offs and that thong.
The soundtrack was Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall,” Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” and Taylor Swift’s “We Are Never Getting Back Together.” Message received?
When she was finished, Daniels pulled out a bag of Cheetos (another Trumpian reference), smiled at us and waved.
This was a lot more illuminating than the Trump speech, during which he repeated his false claims about the “crisis” on our southern border in a stone-faced reading.
This is how he expects to “fire up the troops,” his base? New York Times columnist Gail Collins quoted a friend of hers describing Trump’s delivery: “He makes Jeb Bush looks like a combination of Mighty Mouse and Bruce Springsteen.”
During these cold winter nights when we’re absorbing constant media reports about the government shutdown because of the wall, I’ve been splashing around in newspapers about this hot mess and reading Bob Woodward’s best-seller “Fear: Trump in the White House.” I’m just trying to understand the thought processes of our president. (Woodward will speak at the College Street Music Hall in New Haven Jan. 22.)
In his prologue, Woodward wrote: “The reality was that the United States in 2017 was tethered to the words and actions of an emotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader. Members of his staff had joined to purposefully block some of what they believed were the president’s most dangerous impulses. It was a nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world.”
Shades of Watergate! Woodward has seen this movie before, starring Richard Nixon. Woodward co-wrote the book, “All the President’s Men,” with Carl Bernstein.
Anyway, on Tuesday night, when I watched Trump and missed out on Stormy Daniels live in her underwear, I also took in the rebuttals by U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
Pelosi, another strong, feisty woman who doesn’t back down from Trump, had previously told her Democratic colleagues: “It’s like a manhood thing for him, this wall thing. As if manhood could ever be associated with him.”
During her rebuttal Tuesday, she, like Schumer a couple of minutes later, noted Trump had appealed to fear rather than using facts in his address to the nation. This gets us back to the title of Woodward’s book, inspired by what Trump told him in March 2016 when Trump was running for president: “Real power is — I don’t even want to use the word — fear.”
Indeed, Trump’s nine minutes were filled with statements such as “thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country” “and children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.”
Trump also said the idea of U.S. citizens paying $5.7 billion for the wall is “just common sense” and that it “would very quickly pay for itself” through a new trade deal with Mexico. (Remember Mexico? Trump told us that country was going to pay for the wall.) As the New York Times pointed out in its lengthy “fact check” story of the many errors in Trump’s speech, that new trade agreement has not been passed by Congress and any economic benefits from it would probably “come in the form of lower tariffs for American companies or higher wages for American workers.”
Back here in Connecticut, our representatives are speaking up for federal workers going without pay week after week. Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy released a statement noting that the 800,000 employees furloughed or working without pay include about 1,500 in our state.
Murphy added: “My consituents in Connecticut shouldn’t have to wonder when they’re going to get their next paycheck or when they’re going back to work because the president isn’t getting his wall that no one on the border wants anyway.”
And yet Trump claims: “Many of those people that won’t be receiving a paycheck agree 100 percent with what I’m doing. A lot of those people that you think are upset — certainly they’re not thrilled — but they say, ‘Sir, do the right thing. We need border security.’ And these are people who won’t be getting paid.”
Pelosi calls this “delusionary” thinking. She is asking: who are these people that are willingly giving up their wages for the sake of the wall? “Give us names,” she said.
Trump was at least thoughtful enough to hand out candy Wednesday when he again met with Pelosi and Schumer. But when Pelosi reiterated that Democrats will not support spending $5.7 billion in taxpayer money on the Wall, Trump abruptly said “Bye-bye!” and stormed out of the room.
Trump managed to be elected president through crowd-pleasing tactics such as encouraging his followers to chant “Build the Wall!” and “Lock her (Hillary Clinton) up!” But now he seems to be up against a wall of his own making. And while I’ve pointed out the comic absurdity of it all, it won’t be funny if this chaotic stalemate continues and people start to starve.

Texto completo: There is a very big chance a Wright State graduate will need a very fancy getup this February.
Hannah Beachler, a Centerville-raised graduate of the university’s film and production design program, is featured prominently in a New York Times article about the Oscar campaign for the blockbuster film “Black Panther” and Ryan Coogler , the director of the Marvel film.
Oscar nominations will be announced on Jan. 22, 2019.
Beachler was one of four female department heads who worked with Coogler on Black Panther.
She managed a reported $30 million budget and was the first woman to work for Marvel as a production designer.
Beachler and Rachel Morrison , Black Panther’s director of photography, worked with Coogler on his first feature, the critically acclaimed “Fruitvale Station.”
“I loved looking around every day at all these women in positions we’ve worked so hard to get to,” Beachler told the New York Times. “Because of that, we worked extra hard for Ryan and for the opportunity we’d been given, but we can do this. We are professionals alongside our male counterparts.”
In September, Beachler was inducted into the Dayton Walk of Fame along with a class that included Oscar-nominated filmmaker Julia Reichert, one of Beachler’s professors at Wright State.
If Beachler is nominated for the Production Design Oscar Academy Award, she will be the third person with Miami Valley roots in recent years recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Oakwood-raised actress Allison Janney earned the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role last year at the 90th annual Academy Awards for “I, Tonya.”

Facebook fun has real-life consequences

Texto completo: At some point, shouldn't what's wrong with Facebook ultimately make us wonder what's wrong with us?
We could almost set our clocks by the number of times the social media behemoth has made mea culpa announcements.
A political consulting firm harvested user information. Hackers gained access to phone numbers and email addresses. The New York Times reported Netflix and Spotify received access to peoples Facebook messages as part of features that allowed people to suggest movies, TV shows and music to friends.
It doesnt appear there was anything nefarious done with the access by Netflix and Spotify, and both companies deny wrongdoing. That's reasonable. The New York Times even reported on itself in its story, and denied being aware of the access it had.
But this isn't about the companies that acquired access. It's about the company that offered the access.
Facebook isn't bragging about its privacy limitations and settings any more. Each of the recent revelations has resulted in Facebook pronouncements of how much better it is than it was, each little more than immediate reactions to the most recent piece of news that will infuriate its users.
The recent complaints about Facebook involved them selling users' information. But the Times report makes it clear Facebook is being even more cavalier, giving away information to any number of its partners. Those partners are beginning to find themselves tainted by the relationship, unable to answer angry customers' questions. Those partners are also protecting Facebook. If Facebook isn't alone in its transgressions, developing a plan for punishment or even change becomes exponentially difficult and unlikely.
We can wait for someone else to clean up the mess and make it better and safer. As a society, we're good at that kind of waiting. We're also smart enough to know no one will come along to save us, and we'll continue to swim in this morass and pretend to be outraged every time another revelation comes to light.
Or we can take things into our own hands. It takes no effort to ignore Facebook temporarily or abandon it completely.
That's the challenge, isn't it? We've allowed Facebook to become a centerpoint in our lives. The things we once did via phone calls or letters or email are now generally accomplished on Facebook. Social media can be fantastic because it's social. All of our friends and relatives are there.
But we need to remember who controls the information on Facebook, and it isn't us.
We've spent almost 70 years in fear of Big Brother, the character created by George Orwell in his landmark dystopian novel 1984. We just never realized Big Brother could be so much fun, generating cat videos and photos of our relatives' children.

Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller probe, to leave post

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: WAVELENGTHS - It's a fact that KMOV (Channel 4) reporter Laura Hettiger is no longer co-host of the afternoon show with Guy Phillips on KTRS (550 AM).
But it's only a rumor, and wishful thinking from fans, that Heidi Glaus may take the job.
The popular Glaus left KSDK (Channel 5) on Dec. 28 after more than 20 years, including two stints on "Show Me St. Louis." She filled in for Hettiger last week and sat in again Tuesday.
KTRS program director McGraw Milhaven would say only that no official decision had been made and said Glaus was just filling in because of Hettiger's departure.
In a farewell video somewhat shorter than her seven-month stay at the station, Hettiger cited the grind of working "15, 16 hours a day" to handle both jobs.
A host of "Great Day St. Louis," Hettiger said the heavy workload led to health problems in 2018, including strep throat, a tonsillectomy and a kidney infection.
Hettiger said stepping down from KTRS was in tune with her 2019 resolution to get healthier "in every shape and form: physically, emotionally, financially, spiritually ..."
LAW ENFORCEMENT GRANT - Reporter Grant Bissell, who ankled KSDK (Channel 5) at the end of 2018, has not abandoned the public information business.
Now, he's handing it out for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
Bissell, who grew up in Hillsboro and graduated from Webster University, was at the station since August 2011. before returning home, he worked as a news producer in Las Vegas and a reporter in Columbia, Mo.
"But now it's on to new challenges and opportunities to do something a little different ...," Bissell said in a Facebook post.
WEDDING FIT TO PRINT - Former STLer Ben Duchek and Elizabeth Frei had a big wedding -- or at least one with a big-enough back story to warrant considerable space in the New York Times.
The couple tied the knot Dec. 31 in Washington and their pairing was the focus of a piece in the Times' weekend "Weddings" section.
Duchek, 40, is a 1996 graduate of St. Louis University High and the son of John and Barbara Ruzicka Duchek of the Sappington area. He has lived away from St. Louis since graduating from the University of Maryland.
After two tours in Afghanistan, he now is a captain in the Army Reserve, a civil affairs officer at the Southern Command in Florida.
Writer Nina Reyes tells the tale of how the two met through Tinder in 2016, but did not meet in person for several months. That meeting had to wait until Duchek's job as a general's aide brought him to Washington, where Elizabeth Duchek works for the Department of Homeland Security.
"It was really cool," Barbara Duchek said of the media exposure. "They were above the fold and in color."
BOOK MARK - St. Louis University law professor emerita Eileen Haughey Searls -- director of the Omer Poos Law Library for 48 years -- died Sunday in Maryland at the age of 94. Funeral arrangements are pending in Maryland.
Ms. Searls is credited with building the law library and paving the way for women in legal education, the university reported. She started at SLU in 1952 and retired in 2000.
In 1964, she became the first woman promoted to full professor and was the first to receive tenure at the law school. She was inducted in 2015 into the inaugural class of the Order of the Fleur de Lis Hall of Fame, the law school's highest honor.
Colleagues said she was an active mentor for female students and professors.
"She would come in my office and sit there for an hour and talk about what it meant to be a SLU faculty member, what it meant to be a part of this community," said Sandra H. Johnson, former interim dean of the law school. "It was like being part of Cardinal Nation talking to Eileen."
In 1999, Ms. Searls was awarded the Marian Gould Gallagher Distinguished Service Award from the American Association of Law Libraries. She was inducted into its Hall of Fame in 2010.

Texto completo: Adolph S. Ochs began his newspaper career at the bottom. First, as a paperboy in Knoxville, Tennessee, then as a printer's "devil," a gofer lower than an apprentice.
He went on to build up the New York Times to be one of the greatest newspapers in the world.
Ochs and his wife, Effie, both from Cincinnati, were the head of the family that has continued to run the venerable newspaper since 1896.
"Presidents might come and go, but the Times was a constant, and its voice in the affairs of the United States had always been ultimately that of an Ochs or Sulzberger," wrote Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones in "The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind the New York Times."
Ochs, the son of Bavarian Jewish immigrants, was born in Cincinnati in 1858 just before the Civil War erupted across the nation and at home.
His father served the Union in the 52nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. His mother, a Confederate supporter, was once caught smuggling quinine to rebel troops across the Ohio River. Growing up in a divided house led to Ochs' ability to see multiple views of issues.
The Ochs family moved to Knoxville in 1864 and flirted with success, but fell to hard times, so young Adolph was forced to quit school at age 14 and support his family.
He worked in the composing room at newspapers in Knoxville and Louisville, then served in every role from printer to editor-in-chief of the short-lived Daily Dispatch in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
In 1878, with "$250 and sundry promises to pay," the 20-year-old Ochs bought half interest in the Chattanooga Daily Times. He transformed the Times into a leading voice in the south, even if Ochs' ambitions sometimes surpassed his finances.
During newsprint-buying trips to Cincinnati, Ochs befriended the publisher of the Jewish newspaper the American Israelite who was also the son of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, the leader of American Reform Judaism and founder of Hebrew Union College.
More notably, Ochs became infatuated with Rabbi Wise's daughter, Iphigenia Miriam Wise, known as Effie.
Effie had a more refined upbringing that Ochs, and, according Tifft and Jones, Rabbi Wise was skeptical about the suitability of his daughter's marriage to an "obscure printer."
Adolph and Effie were married on Feb. 28, 1883, at Plum Street Temple, where her father was rabbi. Effie returned to Cincinnati whenever she was expecting, but only one child, Iphigene, born in the Alms Hotel in Walnut Hills, survived.
Meanwhile, the once mighty New-York Times (then printed with a hyphen) struggled after the death of founder George Jones. In 1896, circulation had dropped to 9,000, and the newspaper was losing $1,000 a week.
Ochs, aged 38, seized the opportunity and borrowed $75,000 to buy controlling interest in the New York Times.
"I have got the chance that occurs only once in a century," Ochs wrote to Effie.
In an announcement published in the Times on Aug. 18, 1896, Ochs wrote:
"It will be my earnest aim that The New York Times give the news, all the news, ... impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved."
Ochs also coined the phrase "All the news that's fit to print," which is still printed on the newspaper's masthead, in response to the sensationalized "yellow journalism" practiced by his competitors, Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst.
Under Ochs, the New York Times became the nation's "newspaper of record." He cut costs, increased advertising, implemented new technology and "demanded first-class news reporting," Jean Strouse wrote in the Times for the 100th anniversary of Ochs' ownership.
After Ochs' death in 1935, his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, succeeded him as publisher. The newspaper has remained in the hands of the Ochs-Sulzberger family. In 2018, A.G. Sulzberger, Ochs' great-great-grandson, became the sixth family member to head the New York Times.
Adolph S. Ochs, publisher of the New York Times, made it one of the greatest newspapers in the country.

Why did it take Susan Zirinsky 46 years to become president of CBS News?

Resumen: It didn't take Zirinsky 46 years to become qualified. The news industry needs to recognize and promote female leaders before they reach retirement age.

Texto completo: When producer Susan Zirinsky was tapped as the new president of beleaguered CBS News, the media industry cheered. “I was doing the happy dance. … She is a badass in every sense of the word,” announced a gleeful Gayle King on CBS This Morning. NPR heralded her as “legendary,” while TheCut. com celebrated her as “a media icon. ” The New York Times reported that staffers greeted her with a “roaring ovation. ”
Here’s my question: What took so long?
Zirinsky, the first woman ever to head up CBS News, is 66 years old. She has been working at the network for 46 years — which means she started a year before the executive she’s replacing, David Rhodes, was born.
While it’s great news that CBS finally chose a woman, I’m frankly bewildered by why she wasn’t handed the reins long ago. Or why none of the other immensely talented women at the network were given a shot. Why was it only after CBS lost three of its male stars to allegations of sexual harassment — including corporate CEO Les Moonves, anchor Charlie Rose and “60 Minutes” head Jeff Fager — that it finally elevated a woman?
Read more commentary:
#MeToo next step: We owe it to our daughters to raise them as warriors
Gretchen Carlson: To succeed, #MeToo must target America's laws, not just a few powerful men
Slow #MeToo down: Julie Chen Moonves isn't accountable for her husband
Perhaps I shouldn’t have been surprised. The news industry, for all of its admirable reporting on the #MeToo allegations that felled these and other men, has been woefully lacking in female leadership. And way too slow to understand its own shortcomings.
The Times has had a single female leader in its 167-year history; The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal are at zero. Television is no better. Zirinsky told The Times that she had never sought the job before, though it had been offered. NBC News and Fox News have each had one female news leader, with Fox’s Suzanne Scott named recently after the network’s own #MeToo scandals. (USA TODAY has had three female top editors, including myself and current Editor in Chief Nicole Carroll).
All-male media leadership creates blind spots
The industry’s overwhelmingly male leadership has repercussions well beyond the newsroom. It infects what we believe is important, which issues we dismiss as trivial, and whom we consider powerful and authoritative. A British analysis concluded that more than 75 percent of “experts” quoted in digital news accounts are male. In America, more than 70 percent of Sunday morning politics and policy talk show guests are male. One study of English-language news sites globally found that 77 percent of those mentioned in articles are men, and that women are “routinely marginalized or ‘symbolically annihilated’ in the news. ”
How does that play out? Just one example: Think about how you first learned, four or so years ago, that Bill Cosby had allegedly drugged and sexually abused dozens of women. Most likely you saw it in a tabloid, or heard about it from late-night comics. Yes, there was some serious reporting on the case, but for the most part it was considered a salacious diversion from “real” news. It wasn’t until the Harvey Weinstein allegations several years later that the #MeToo movement exploded, and the news media belatedly realized that sexual harassment is a systemic problem infecting society, not a juicy scandal about a lone pervert. Yet in its contours, the Weinstein saga was identical to the Cosby story: a powerful man accused of sexually abusing dozens of women while being protected by his industry and his influence.
In short, we in the news media blew it. Cosby, like Weinstein, was a symptom of a far larger societal crisis impacting millions of women. We should have known better — and perhaps with a few more women in news leadership roles, we would have.
CBS News is in precarious shape
It’s a heavy burden to expect that Zirinsky, or any one newsroom leader of any gender, can correct all of these ills. But another piece of research gives us a hint of what Zirinsky is up against. It turns out that women are far more likely to get the top job when an organization is in “precarious” shape — and if they can’t turn it around they are marched right off the dreaded “glass cliff,” a phrase coined by University of Exeter researchers Michelle K. Ryan and S. Alexander Haslam. CBS News certainly fits the “precarious” bill: In addition to its string of #MeToo dismissals, it has suffered ratings declines at "CBS This Morning," "Face the Nation" and "CBS Evening News" over the past year.
Coverage of Zirinsky, especially given that she is the first woman in the role, isn’t likely to make her job any easier. The news industry itself treats female leaders far more harshly than male leaders. A Rockefeller Foundation study found that when a company is in crisis, 80 percent of news reports will blame a female CEO — but if the CEO is a man, only a minority of news reports will blame him.
There is a solution to this, and a fairly straightforward one: Bring more women into news leadership. Identify promising women in media. Develop them. Promote them. And recognize when they have earned the right to ascend to the top job. Certainly, it didn’t take Susan Zirinsky a full 46 years to become qualified for the presidency of CBS News. And just as surely, there are other women waiting in the wings with the potential to lead. Let’s find them, and not wait until they hit retirement age to acknowledge their talents, their skill and their vision to lead the news industry into the future.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Rod J. Rosenstein, a lifelong Republican with a tough-on-crime record, was eager to put his stamp on the Justice Department when he was sworn in as the deputy attorney general in the early months of the Trump administration.
Instead, he was abruptly thrust into a political maelstrom after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director only two weeks later. Mr. Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to investigate Russia's election interference and spent the next year and a half defending that inquiry from both Mr. Trump's unwavering attacks and attempted political intrusion by his congressional allies.
Now Mr. Rosenstein plans to step down as the United States' No. 2 law enforcement official after Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, is confirmed, three administration officials said on Wednesday. Senators could vote to confirm him as early as next month.
Mr. Barr will represent a new chapter for the Justice Department and for the Russia investigation, which is nearing its final stages and is expected to be finished in the coming weeks or months, according to senior law enforcement officials. They cautioned that like any investigation, it could be prolonged if the special counsel overseeing the inquiry, Robert S. Mueller III, were to cover uncover new evidence central to his mandate.
Mr. Barr, who met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday ahead of his confirmation hearing next week, holds a dim view of aspects of the investigation but affirmed that he would allow it to conclude, said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
"He says Bob Mueller is a great guy -- ethical, professional," Mr. Graham said of Mr. Barr in a brief interview. "He believes that he is not on a witch hunt, trusts him to be fair to the president and the country, and has no reason to believe he is not going to do that."
The timing of Mr. Rosenstein's anticipated departure was unconnected to the Mueller investigation, a Trump administration official said. Mr. Rosenstein privately told Mr. Barr weeks ago that a term of roughly two years seemed like the right length, according to Mr. Graham.
After Jeff Sessions's time as attorney general was done, Mr. Rosenstein was supportive of the decision to replace him with Mr. Barr, according to a person who has discussed the issue with Mr. Rosenstein. He and Mr. Barr worked together at the Justice Department during the George Bush administration.
While most deputy attorneys general labor in obscurity, Mr. Rosenstein became a target of criticism from the president and his allies while liberals cheered his efforts to shield the Russia investigation from Mr. Trump's vitriol. He was given standing ovations at many of his speeches last year and was feted on late-night television. Strangers would ask him for his autograph and for photographs with him at airports and in other public places.
But his record on the Russia investigation was more complicated. In the tumultuous days after the president fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, Mr. Rosenstein was shaken and angry, concerned that the White House had used him to justify the firing, associates have said.
In meetings with senior law enforcement officials, he suggested secretly taping his conversations with Mr. Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office, according to people familiar with the discussions and a memo written by Andrew McCabe, then the deputy F.B.I. director.
Mr. Rosenstein ultimately sought to stem the chaos by appointing Mr. Mueller as special counsel, but he consulted almost no one, according to three department officials who were not authorized to discuss the appointment.
Later, his work to protect the Mueller investigation from Mr. Trump's congressional allies, whom Democrats accused of trying to subvert sensitive investigations, also drew criticism. To mollify the lawmakers, Mr. Rosenstein made scores of documents related to those inquiries available, moves that ran counter to law enforcement's reticence to share information about investigations.
Senior law enforcement officials noted that under Mr. Rosenstein, the department won one of its most critical battles with conservative lawmakers who had sought the declassification of a wiretap application at the heart of the Russia inquiry. Despite congressional Republicans' urging, the White House declined to release the document.
"Rod was in a truly unusual position and was largely a steady hand," said Megan L. Brown, a lawyer at the firm Wiley Rein who worked at the Justice Department with Mr. Rosenstein under President George W. Bush.
A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School, Mr. Rosenstein had worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years before becoming deputy attorney general. Early on, he was a trial lawyer in Washington and later was the United States attorney for Maryland under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama.
He ascended to his post eager to help Mr. Sessions crack down on violent crime and drug trafficking and became known for the long hours he kept while running the day-to-day work of the Justice Department, sometimes sending emails at 3 a.m., according to two lawyers who worked closely with him.
Inside the department, law enforcement officials said Mr. Rosenstein helped usher in the sort of tough-on-crime policies that he supported during his 12 years as the top federal prosecutor in Maryland. He paid also special attention to the nation's federal prosecutors, some of whom said they felt neglected during past administrations.
Mr. Rosenstein has been at the forefront of Trump administration efforts to crack down on Chinese spying while also tightening rules and cracking down on department employees who provide information to the news media to inform the public.
He had an uneven relationship with Mr. Trump almost from the start. Though the president blamed Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation, for the appointment of a special counsel, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Rosenstein repeatedly, calling him "conflicted" in one instance because Mr. Rosenstein had recommended Mr. Comey's firing but installed Mr. Mueller.
The relationship was tested in September after The New York Times revealed Mr. Rosenstein's questioning in May 2017 of Mr. Trump's fitness to be president and offers to secretly record conversations with him. Mr. Rosenstein has denied that account.
Rattled and unsure how the president would react, Mr. Rosenstein considered quitting and even had aides draft a news release about his resignation. But senior White House advisers urged him to stay on, and, over time, he and the president, who meet or speak by telephone frequently, found common ground.
It almost certainly helps that he is no longer the top law enforcement official overseeing the Mueller investigation. After the holidays last month, Mr. Rosenstein and his family visited Mr. Trump at the White House to meet the president and have a photograph taken with him.
His uneasy standing with Mr. Trump is not lost on him. At a conference last month where the president was to appear later, Mr. Rosenstein joked: "You let the president know that his favorite deputy attorney general was here."

Texto completo: "Guaranteed health care for all" is Newsom's "big beautiful wall."
Gov. Gavin Newsom punctuated his inaugural address this week with several jabs at President Donald Trump, referring at one point to "the corruption and incompetence in the White House."
However, while neither man would admit it, they share a similar political problem. Having made extravagant promises to gain support from partisan bases, they now must deliver or somehow wriggle out of them.
The New York Times revealed recently that Trump's pledge to build "a big beautiful wall" along the U.S.-Mexico border to deter immigration was never a fully vetted proposal, but a throwaway line in his stump speech.
When the wall promise galvanized voters in key industrial states, Trump was stuck with it. But with Congress balking, it led to a partial shutdown of the federal government.
In seeking the governorship last year, Newsom also made extravagant promises aimed at the ascendant Berniecrat wing of his Democratic Party. He told those on the left what they wanted to hear and on primary election night in June, promising "Guaranteed health care for all. A 'Marshall Plan' for affordable housing. A master plan for aging with dignity. A middle-class workforce strategy. A cradle-to-college promise for the next generation. An all-hands approach to ending child poverty."
After winning the governorship in November, however, Newsom began to step back, cognizant that delivering on his promises would cost many tens of billions of dollars.
While some of those promises might be feasible, "Guaranteed health care for all" is Newsom's "big beautiful wall" — something that draws cheers from the faithful but would be virtually impossible to deliver.
Tellingly, during a pre-inaugural event on Sunday, Newsom said, "Anyone who suggests that you can create universal this or universal that, even if you wanted to in six months to a year, our capacity to deliver on that is limited, so we're going to create the architecture, the framework, we'll set the goals."
Setting a goal is easy. You just say it, send out a press release or even write it into law. Reaching the goal is something else entirely.
Newsom kissed off universal health care in a few words during his 2,700-plus-word inaugural address, saying, "In our home (of California), every person should have access to quality, affordable health care," while pledging, "we will never waver in our pursuit of guaranteed health care for all Californians."
It's doubtful that the fervent advocates of universal health care will be placated by such a vague statement or even his initial actions to extend Medi-Cal coverage to a few more undocumented immigrants and offer health insurance subsidies to middle-class families.
The advocates, led by the California Nurses Association, want nothing short of universal, single-payer coverage.
Nor will California political media forget about universal health care and the other specific promises that Newsom made last year, such as building 3.5 million new homes in six years.
CALmatters and the Sacramento Bee have already documented those promises and will chart his progress on delivery. Politifact, which specializes in separating fact from political fiction, has set up a "Newsom-Meter" for that same purpose.
Newsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown, stumbled badly in his first stint as governor 40 years ago by doing 180-degree flips of position. He was more cautious during his second governorship, making few specific promises, delivering on those he made and avoiding battles he thought he couldn't win.
Newsom talks about having "audacious hairy goals," but promising too much and reneging would make him appear flaky. He could ask Brown about the corrosive effect of that image on one's political career.

Texto completo: Lin-Manuel Miranda is not throwing away his shot at being a bookstore owner.
The composer and playwright, whose musical "Hamilton" became a worldwide phenomenon after its Broadway debut in 2015, teamed with three of his friends to buy the Drama Book Shop in Manhattan, the New York Times reports.
The store has long been a stalwart of New York's theater community. It was founded in 1917, according to the store's website, and has changed locations several times. The bookseller moved to its current space on West 40th Street in 2001. The shop won a special Tony Award in 2011.

The store's last day on West 40th will be Jan. 20, after which it will move to a new location, which hasn't been disclosed.
Miranda told the New York Times that the store was important to him and noted he wrote much of "In the Heights," his first musical, in the store's basement, which is also home to a 50-seat theater.
"When I was in high school I would go to the old location and sit on the floor and read plays -- I didn't have the money to buy them," Miranda said.
Along with Miranda, the store's new owners include the director of "Hamilton," Thomas Kail, and one of the play's producers, Jeffrey Seller. James L. Nederlander, a New York theater operator, is also a new co-owner.
The store's previous owner, Rozanne Seelen, told the New York Times that she was grateful to the new owners, whom she called her "white knights."
"It's the chronic problem -- the rents were just too high, and I'm 84 years old -- I just didn't have the drive to find a new space and make another move," Seelen said.
After the store's 2011 Tony win, Seelen reflected on her long association with the store and its place in the New York theater community.
"It's something that belongs to the community," Seelen told Backstage magazine. "It's the community that's made it possible for us to win this award. The people who have worked for us, the people that come in the door -- they're the ones that should be getting the award, because they've kept us going."
On Twitter, Miranda shared news of his purchase as well as a photo of him with actor Christopher Jackson in front of the store in 2002.

70% tax for the mega-rich? Not a shock

Texto completo: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked the political establishment by defeating a machine politician in a New York Democratic primary for Congress last June. Ever since then, Republicans and conservatives have been trying to smear her as a know-nothing socialist ditz unfit to sit in the House chamber with all those gray-bearded sages who have made the House such a model of reasoned and informed debate.
The latest such campaign erupted this weekend. I'm not talking about the unearthing of a dance video from her college years, which backfired spectacularly by making Ocasio-Cortez seem youthful and joyous, but an interview with the newly minted member of Congress broadcast Sunday on "60 Minutes" but released by CBS on Friday.
In the interview, Ocasio-Cortez argues for raising the top federal income tax rate on the richest Americans to as much as 70% from the current 37% and using the money to convert the country to renewable energy.

Conservative heads exploded. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) accused her on Twitter of wanting to "take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs." Right-wing anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist implied that the "expropriation" of 70% of "your production" was coming uncomfortably close to "slavery." Pro-Trump commentator Ryan Fournier declared that he was "not going to work my ass off for the rest of my life for 70% of my income to go to the government."
All three, and anyone else speaking out in this vein, displayed their rank ignorance of how the federal income tax works. That's the charitable explanation of their reaction. The only other explanation is that they know how it works, and they were lying about her proposal. (Ignoramuses or liars? You make the call.)
Let's examine the issue. That requires first understanding marginal tax rates, on which the federal income tax is structured. Taxpayers pay a given tax rate on income up to a certain level, then a higher rate on the next swath of income, a higher rate on income above that, and so on, until they reach the top rate on all remaining income up to infinity. We know of these chunks of income as "tax brackets."
In 2019, married taxpayers filing jointly will pay 10% of their first $19,400 in adjusted gross income (after certain exemptions and deductions), 12% of the next $59,550, 22% of the next $89,450, and four higher percentages on four further chunks of income up to the maximum of 37% on all income of $612,351 or more.
In other words, no one earning $612,351 or more is taxed at 37% -- they're taxed at a combination of all those lower rates -- the blended rate, for someone just hitting the top bracket, would be about 26.7%.
Ocasio-Cortez proposed to add a new bracket for income over $10 million, and tax everything over that ceiling at 70%. She wasn't talking about taxing all income of a $10-million earner at 70%, just the amount over $10 million. If that bracket were added to today's brackets, a taxpayer with income of, say, $11 million would have an overall tax rate not of 70%, but about 39.5%.
How many people are we talking about? According to the IRS, for the 2016 tax year, the most recent full year reported, out of the 150.3 million returns filed, only 16,087 reported income of more than $10 million. Those returns accounted for less than 0.05% of the total filed, and on average reported taxable income of $25.2 million.
None of this could surprise people who are experienced in the ways of tax policy, such as Rep. Scalise and Norquist. It does seem to flummox many others. To be fair, that includes the New York Times, which wrote on Sunday that Ocasio-Cortez had "floated plans to tax the extremely wealthy by as much as 70 percent."
That's a slipshod way of describing her proposal, since one would have to have a truly stupendous income to bring the blended percentage anywhere close to 70%. Someone with $100 million in income would still be paying only about 67%; someone with a W-2 form showing annual income of $1 billion would pay 69.7%, but that seems stretching a point all the way to fiction.
Ocasio-Cortez's critics might offer the defense that she was vague about how her proposal would be applied to the wealthy, but that won't wash. She was absolutely precise in her interview on "60 Minutes" with Anderson Cooper, in referring to a marginal rate of 70% on income over $10 million, noting that her proposal "doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate." On the air, Cooper (a member of the Vanderbilt family, by the way) called her proposal part of "a radical agenda."
One other point overlooked by the New York Times and skated over by the tax warriors is that Ocasio-Cortez plainly was referring to the tax on earned income -- that is, mostly wages and salaries. "Unearned income" -- including capital gains and some dividends -- is taxed at a much lower rate, topping out in 2019 at only 20%.
That's important because the wealthy report a much higher share of their income as capital gains than does the middle or working class.
On average, in 2016 taxpayers reporting income of $10 million or more claimed nearly 54% of their income as capital gains or dividends subject to the low rate; only 17.5% of their income was reported as wages or salary. For an average taxpayer reporting income in the $75,000-$100,000 range, about 76% was wages and salary taxed at ordinary rates, and only 2% qualified as capital gains and qualified dividends.
That's another indication of how much less than 70% even the "extremely wealthy" would pay under Ocasio-Cortez's proposal.
Finally, it's proper to place Ocasio-Cortez's proposal in historical context. There's nothing especially radical or "socialist" about it. In fact, it's pretty conservative.
The top marginal rate in the U.S. was 70% from 1965 to 1981, a period that covers the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter, and for most of that period that rate was applied to incomes starting at about $200,000; that much income in 1974 is the equivalent of nearly $1.1 million today.
Going just a bit further back, the top rate was 91% from 1946 to 1963 (the Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy years), applied to incomes of $400,000 or more. That income in 1956 would be the equivalent of $3.8 million today. Somehow the rich kept working, and the republic did not fall. Indeed, those years included periods of unexampled prosperity and the growth of a strong middle class in the United States.
So why all the heavy breathing today? One reason is that the wealthy have become used to getting their own way on tax rates ever since the top rate started to come down sharply under Ronald Reagan, and they now think they're owed what is virtually a free lunch. Another is an observation about progressive tax rates made in 1996 by Nixon's former chief economist, Herbert Stein, which I never tire of quoting. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Stein offered "one law derived from 60 years of observation.... Whatever is the existing degree of progression, people who pay the top rate will think it is too much."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vowed a "prudent" withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, embracing a new, more cautious timeline on Monday while appearing to deny that he had ever ordered an immediate troop departure in the first place.
"We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!" Trump said in a morning tweet. That was "no different from my original statements," he said, accusing the news media of inaccurately reporting "my intentions on Syria."
Last month, Trump declared the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and said troops would be "coming back now." Since then, senior officials have issued a series of statements that have cast doubt on his promise of a quick departure.
The president's endorsement of a flexible departure, conditioned on the still-to-come defeat of the Islamic State, was the latest indication of his administration's zigzagging foreign policy, in which decisions are often made by dramatic presidential tweets and followed by more circumspect policies reflecting top advisers' views.
The initial plan for a quick withdrawal, which would require turning over the U.S.-supported effort against remaining militants to NATO ally Turkey, was met with dismay among officials and lawmakers who feared the Islamic State could return in force. A day after Trump's announcement, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest.
Trump's new remarks appeared to endorse a revised proposal, floated by National Security Adviser John Bolton a day earlier, that would allow U.S. troops and their local allies to extinguish a small but stubborn militant force before they depart. It would also require Turkey to refrain from attacking Syrian Kurdish troops who are the chief U.S. partner on the ground.
The evolving plans came as Bolton traveled Monday to Ankara, Turkey's capital, for talks with Turkish officials on the U.S. withdrawal, including protection of the American-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, which Turkey has vowed to expel from northeast Syria.
Officials across the government have scrambled in recent days to keep up with shifting statements from administration leaders, even as they continued to make plans for a near-term military exit that they cautioned could squander the fruits of a four-year military effort. There are more than 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
While Trump initially demanded a 30-day departure, officials said the administration later settled on an exit within 120 days to give the military more time to break down bases and safely remove equipment and personnel. The latest comments from Trump and Bolton intensified uncertainty about what would occur.
Trump's pullout plan fueled concerns among allied nations, including France and Britain, who have sent their own troops to Syria. It also drew criticism from his own party, including from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who on Sunday said Trump had "made a mistake" with his initial pronouncement but was now "slowing down."
On Monday, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused Trump of "changing course like a drunken sailor."
"It shows that our president literally doesn't know what he is doing. He is making it up as he goes," Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., told CNN. "The way he is going about it is disastrous."
But Trump and his top advisers were defiant Monday as they denied that their Syria plans had changed.
"The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria," Trump said in the same tweet, referring to articles on Sunday from numerous publications, including the Times and The Washington Post, that noted the shifting accounts of the military exit. "No different from my original statements."

Texto completo: Year after year, the arrests for toplessness at public beaches generated headlines and signaled the start of summer.
Newspapers ran stories about the nearly naked outlaws, and leaders denounced the public display of nipples.
No shirtless bather would be allowed "to mar the high standard and fine appearance" of Long Island's newly created Ocean Beach Park, said resolute local Police Chief Philip B. Kohut, after the trial of three men arrested for swimming topless.
Men.
That's right. Seems like no big deal today. Shirtless men everywhere - on the beach, at swimming pools, jogging along neighborhood streets.
But 1930s America lived in fear of the male nipple. It was illegal in most states and cities for men to go anywhere shirtless, even at the beach.
So, yes, nearly 100 years ago, men fought for the right to go topless.
Which is a little funny, right?
Because today, women are doing the same thing in Ocean City, where a group of five sunbathers has sued for the right to decide how much of their bodies to show at the beach. They argue that because men walk on the beach shirtless, women should be able to do so, too.
Last month a federal judge ruled that the beach town can continue to enforce its ban on topless women as the lawsuit plays out.
Ocean City leaders argue that their town is a family-friendly resort. And families - the same families that pass bongs and shot glasses and sexually explicit T-shirts being peddled on the boardwalk - are not ready for so much skin.
These are the same arguments men who wanted to swim shirtless faced in the 1920s, when they were expected to wear full swim suits - all with tank tops to hide the nipples, most of the clothing made of wool. The fancier models even had attached swim skirts to add a little more mystery to what was going on south of the belt line - skirts that were a requirement in many swimming pools.
And men rebelled, showing up in trunks, pulling off their shirts or rolling down the tank tops and getting locked up.
A headline on a June 16, 1934, Associated Press story called it the "Perennial Battle of Togs" before listing which cities and states would jail men for indecency if they showed their chests.
"New York City, for example, is that way about half-naked natators at municipal beaches. It arrests them on sight. Fines of $1 are the penalty. The city fathers insist on complete bathing suits - tops and trunks, or one-piece suits combining both."
Many places where folks understood the outcome of a water-meets-light-colored-fabric equation specifically banned all-white suits.
In the District, men were urged to swim in the one-piece suits their hotels provided.
And the northeastern fashion of flirting with lawlessness by wearing a tank top but letting the straps slip to reveal some pecs was strictly and specifically prohibited.
"All we demand is decency," William E. Whittacker, secretary of the Boston Metropolitan District Commission, told the Associated Press. "But we won't allow slipping straps."
Geez, so many rules.
Men grew tired of being told what they could do with their bodies and kept rebelling, especially after observing the way dames swooned after seeing Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller bare-chested in the 1932 "Tarzan the Ape Man" flick.
The problem, of course, was that not all men looked like dreamboat Weissmuller.
Not all women were thrilled with the views their non-Olympian peers provided. A group of pearl-clutching New Yorkers said they had "no desire to gaze upon hairy chested men," according to a June 29, 1936, Associated Press story.
"In this year of campaigns we are having our own drive, and we won't stop until every hairy chested man covers up on the beach or removes the curls from his chest," said Grace Donohue, a spokeswoman for the group who demanded men wear shirts or wax.
Nevertheless, they persisted.
One hot August day in 1935, police rounded up, arrested and fined 42 men who protested and swam topless on the beach in Atlantic City, according to the New York Times. City official Thomas D. Taggart Jr. logged each of their arrests and collected a $2 fine from each bare-chested man.
The summer of 1936 was the summer of the men's no-shirt movement, and arrests and protests and slipped straps were an epidemic.
But the next year, at the epicenter of the men's protests and mass arrests, a lengthy experience with "bareback bathing," as some called it, changed one important man's mind.
" 'Bareback' bathing for men, heretofore taboo in Atlantic City, broke down the last line of official resistance today and will be allowed this Summer," the New York Times reported on March 29, 1937. "Mayor C.D. White succeeded in holding off the invasion of shirtless bathing suits all last Summer on the ground they were 'not nice.' But today he returned from a vacation in Florida a convert to the style."
A judge in New York overturned the ban the same year. And boom, male nipples were free.

The biggest transgression Joe Biden will have to answer for is being a straight white male

Texto completo: Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, plagiarized speeches, has deep and sometimes shady ties to banks, wrote the now-loathed 1994 crime bill, and supported the Patriot Act, but in the Democratic primary, the main crime for which he will have to answer is being a white male.

If Biden jumps in, he already has two demerits against him.

The former vice president is moving closer to announcing whether he’ll launch a campaign, according to a New York Times report. “Mr. Biden would instantly be the early front-runner if he ran, but he would have to bridge divides in a primary that would test whether Democrats are willing to embrace a moderate white man in his 70s if they view him as the best bet to oust Mr. Trump,” the article said, perfectly capturing the anxiety of the modern Democratic Party.

What is Biden’s answer for being a white man in a party that puts a premium on minorities and women? The last two candidates Democrats nominated were former President Barack Obama (black!) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (woman!).

The Hill reported just two weeks ago that Democrats are wracked with “worry” because a poll of Iowa voters showed that “the three people leading polls in the very early stages of their presidential race are all white men.”

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who last month earnestly tweeted that “our future is female” and “intersectional,” all but said the party should reject a white man as its nominee.

"I love the fact that Barack Obama was our president for eight years,” she said on CNN in December. “I hope more people of color not only aspire [but] win the presidency, because that’s what makes America so extraordinary, that we are all of that, we are everything, and I think a more inclusive America is a stronger America."

Mind you, when she said “more inclusive,” she meant: Back of the line, white men.

The problem is the same for other Democratic front-runners Bernie Sanders, senator of Vermont, and Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas representative.

O’Rourke has the advantage of the entire national media loving him, but so do Sens. Kamala Harris of California (black woman!) and Cory Booker of New Jersey (black man and maybe even a little gay!).

Biden may have some of the working-class appeal that President Trump has, but unfortunately for him, he’s white and in the wrong party.

Fire kills 5 girls in 'escape room'
WARSAW — A faulty heating system appeared to have caused a fire at a house in northern Poland where five teenage girls died while locked inside a recreational escape room that was installed in the rented dwelling, investigators said Saturday. Firefighters in the city of Koszalin found the bodies of the 15-year-old victims Friday after they extinguished a fire in a room adjacent to the one the girls had entered while celebrating a birthday. Autopsies showed the girls died of carbon monoxide asphyxiation, prosecutors said. A 26-year-old man employed at the location was hospitalized with burns. Players in escape room games are locked inside a room or building and must solve puzzles and find clues that lead them to the key that will unlock the door. (AP)
JAPAN
Tuna auction yields record $3m bid
The first tuna auction of the year at Tokyo's new fish market set a high bar Saturday after a restaurant chain paid a record price — more that $3 million — for a giant bluefin tuna. The city's famed Tsukiji fish market was relocated to the new space, in the Toyosu neighborhood, late last year to make way for the 2020 Olympics. The market was well known for its pre-dawn tuna auctions, a tradition that is continuing at the new location. The $5.3 billion enclosed, air-conditioned facility at Toyosu is a far cry from the grime and grit of Tsukiji, which served as the city's main fish market for 83 years. Saturday's high bidder, Kiyoshi Kimura, the self-styled “King of Tuna," runs the Sushi Zanmai chain of restaurants. (New York Times)
SERBIa
Fifth week of rallies draws thousands
BELGRADE — Thousands of people braved snow and freezing temperatures in Serbia's capital to turn up for the fifth week of street protests against populist President Aleksandar Vucic. The demonstrators marched through downtown Belgrade blowing whistles and booing and jeering loudly as they passed the Serbian presidency building Saturday. Some carried Serbian flags and banners. The demonstrations started after thugs beat up an opposition leader in November, putting pressure on Vucic. (AP)

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

More board the vegan train, from WeWork to Wu-Tang Clan

Texto completo: Vegan eating soared to new heights in 2018, sparking menu innovations, business opportunities, new laws and increased conflict. The year was one of contrasts, where watermelon hams burned up the internet while raw hog waste poured into the Atlantic Ocean after Hurricane Florence slammed into North Carolina.
The end-of-year climate talks in Poland were criticized by some for serving too much meat and marked by the dire reports issued at the gathering. The World Resources Institute released one such report that found livestock is responsible for 60 percent of agricultural emissions.
The assumption that everyone does or should eat meat faded somewhat during the past year. We saw this when Monopoly launched a Millennial version in which all players are vegan; Google removed the egg from its salad emoji to make it vegan-friendly; the US Vegan Climate Index fund went live under the ticker VEGAN; and co-working company WeWork banned its 6,000 employees from expensing meals that contain meat.
Also significant: The New York Times published an opinion piece calling for a carbon tax on beef, which echoed an earlier report warning investors that meat taxes will be adopted by select countries within five to 10 years.
HiGH-STYLE VEGANS
Meat taxes are too wonky to register on the pop culture radar, yet the glamorous and the influential continued their high-style embrace of plant-based foods in 2018.
During the Christmas holidays the British papers were full of news that Carole Middleton, mother-in-law to Prince William, is eating vegan. Middleton told a style reporter she planned to serve vegan options at the Christmas dinner she hosted for her family, which now includes four heirs to the throne.
A month earlier and on this side of the Atlantic, First Daughter Ivanka Trump tweeted about two of her children from the annual White House turkey pardon: "Joseph and Arabella have sworn off turkey and are insisting on a vegetarian Thanksgiving!"
The year saw the Wu-Tang Clan endorse White Castle's vegan sliders, British TV chef Jamie Oliver host a vegan episode encouraging viewers to eat less meat or none at all, and BeyoncÃ© go vegan for a month and a half before headlining the Coachella music festival in California. BeyoncÃ© wasn't the only celebrity benefiting from vegan eating's transformative health effects. Taraji P. Henson, Kevin Smith, Ne-Yo and will.i.am all praised the vegan lifestyle during 2018.
VEGANS VS. MEAT-EATERS
As the year wore on, the continued shift toward plant-based eating caused butchers, factory farmers, dairy operators and meat lobbyists to ramp up calls for government protections, labeling laws and other marketplace barriers.
In August, the French city of Calais canceled a vegan festival, a cancellation that the organizers blamed on "hunters and farmers" who've made "very clear threats about what would happen if the event went ahead." Earlier in the summer, butchers in France (ground zero for the foie gras trade) asked for government protection following reports of vegan activists throwing fake blood on butcher shops. "Some people have suggested that butchers are overstating the threat based on a few incidents," NPR reported in its story on the conflict.
Here in the United States in 2018, the conflict played out in the political and legal arenas. The most significant was when North Carolina factory pig farm neighbors won two multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the farms' corporate owners for the human disease, stench, flies and general nuisance the operations create. North Carolina lawmakers responded by making it more difficult to file such claims.
Missouri politicians took a similar tack with a first-in-the-nation labeling law that, since August, has made it illegal to sell food labeled "vegan burger" or "plant-based sausage" in the state. The Missouri move follows a French ban enacted in the spring which outlaws meat and dairy terms on vegetarian foods sold in that country. Consumer groups and plant-based meat producers are challenging the Missouri law in court.
LOCAL ACTION
It's no secret the culture is different on the West Coast, where the California legislature passed a law in 2018 requiring healthcare facilities, hospitals and prisons to offer vegan options. At the close of the year, Los Angeles lawmakers seeking climate change relief were considering a similar requirement for all large entertainment venues in the city.
On the other side of the globe, residents of Tel Aviv organized an all-vegan political party this year to run candidates in municipal elections. Over in The Netherlands, the government released new dietary guidelines calling on Dutch citizens to eat much less meat, fish, eggs and cheese due to the outsized environmental footprint of animal-based foods.
In Toronto, a growing cluster of vegan businesses moved into the Parkdale neighborhood, rebranding it Vegandale. The Canadian government itself drew applause from both farmers and vegetarians when it pledged $180 million to support research and development of plant-based proteins.
Here in the eastern half of the United States, progressive cities also embraced the societal shift away from animal-based diets. In September, Philadelphia's tourism bureau launched a publicity campaign touting the city's "robust vegan dining scene." In October, Miami held its first vegan restaurant week. The municipal government of Asheville, North Carolina, along with the local hospital and the Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, held a weeklong vegan challenge in June, during which restaurants added vegan dishes and city residents were encouraged to eat vegan.
And in July, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a proclamation calling on residents to eat less meat in order to lower the city's carbon footprint.
CHANGING MARKETPLACE
In 2018, savvy entrepreneurs saw opportunity in plant-based foods. And those hostile to them found themselves with fewer customers. Consider these restaurant tales from 2018.
First the story of a new, all-vegan fish and chips restaurant in London, which was opened by the owners of a traditional fish and chips shop. The manager of the vegan shop told a reporter: "When we put vegan options on the menu of our other shop, there was so much demand we could hardly keep up."
Contrast that with the news in September that a 128-year-old London hand pie shop was closing, and the owner blamed its demise on changing demographics and the rise of vegan eating. The owner said customers asked for vegan options and he refused, calling the requests "some kind of bad joke."
Finally to Hong Kong, where the owner of a meat-heavy restaurant knew the menu was in direct conflict with his desire to protect the oceans. So against everyone's advice he took the menu 100 percent vegan. The restaurant remains packed and the owner says any customers he lost in the switch were replaced by new customers seeking vegan food.
Despite the efforts of lawmakers in France and Missouri, vegan versions of animal products saw sales climb in 2018. Beyond Meat even filed for a $100 million initial public stock offering in November.
Canadian fast food chain A&W added the company's vegan Beyond Burger to its menu this year, and the resulting demand triggered a nationwide shortage of the burgers. Earlier in the year, purchase data from a leading supermarket in California revealed that Beyond Meat burgers were out-selling animal-based burgers in the grocer's meat case.
I'm afraid more tough times are ahead for hamburger hawkers: In 2019 the vegan Impossible Burger, sold only in restaurants until now, will be rolled out to supermarkets.
After a year like the one just past, I expect momentous vegan strides to be made this year. Turns out, the editors at The Economist agree. In the prestigious magazine's annual look-ahead forecast released in December they christened 2019 "The year of the vegan."

Texto completo: Whatever else he was -- liberator, totalitarian despot, bombastic blowhard -- Fidel Castro was a showman, and Americans, as we know, can be suckers for a showman.
His visit to New York in April 1959, four months after the overthrow of the authoritarian Fulgencio Batista, was managed by a public relations firm that had him cuddling babies, licking an ice cream cone and feeding peanuts to elephants at the Bronx Zoo. He even posed with a group of schoolchildren sporting fake beards.
The following year -- after he had nationalized American businesses in Cuba and joined Moscow on the other side of the Cold War -- Castro would visit again, and the reception would be bitterly divided. But in 1959 he was still something of a mystery man, coy about his ideology and allegiances, a voluble populist in fatigues. He encountered mostly adoring crowds and bedazzled press coverage.
I was a fourth grader in California when Castro first took Manhattan, but 36 years later, as foreign editor of The New York Times, I was his designated greeter when he visited the newspaper's old home on 43rd Street. By then, of course, there were few illusions about El Comandante. He had helped bring the world to the edge of nuclear war; he was a relic of a discredited creed; and his regime's response to independent journalists and other dissenters was rigorous censorship and incarceration. He had been the target of punishing sanctions and assassination plots.
Still, celebrity is its own credential. He didn't feed the elephants in 1995, but he still managed to draw cheering crowds in Harlem and the South Bronx. He was feted in the homes of trade-hungry business executives. At the U.N. his speech was more heartily applauded than President Clinton's.
Castro was at The Times to be interviewed by the publisher and senior editors in the 14th-floor board room, but after that he insisted on encountering "the workers." As he cut a swath through the third-floor newsroom, joking about the squalid working conditions, I cringed a little at the star-struck reception of a dictator whose country was consistently ranked as the least free in the Americas. The swirl of excitement reminded me of the adulation that greeted Mikhail Gorbachev when he first visited New York in 1988 -- but Gorbachev was at least striving to be on the right side of history.
Castro, on the contrary, was proud of his repressive regime, as he made clear in the Times board room. "Replying to a question about Cuba's longstanding policy of imprisoning dissidents," Lizette Alvarez reported in The Times, "Mr. Castro agreed with estimates by Amnesty International that some 600 Cubans are in prison for political reasons. But he quickly defended the policy, saying he was not alone in jailing those who fight against the state."
Castro proudly boasted of how he had duped Herbert L. Matthews, a Times correspondent who visited a rebel encampment in the Sierra Maestra mountains in 1957 and was smitten by the rebel leader. Castro said he had his men parade repeatedly through the camp to give the impression of a more formidable army. The ensuing article, he said, had been "very helpful." So, add to the Castro resume: pioneer of fake news.

Texto completo: Actors who undergo major transformations are a staple of award-season chatter, and this year is no exception. We've heard a great deal of it already: Did you recognize Tilda Swinton under all that old-man makeup? How did Rami Malek manage to speak coherently while sporting such large fake teeth? Just how many pounds did Christian Bale put on to play a certain calculating politician? And so on.
But no matter how talented an actor is, they never go it alone. Among those who help them physically embody their characters are often prosthetic and makeup artists, hairstylists, vocal coaches and, of course, directors.
In honor of the Golden Globe Awards, which air Sunday night on NBC, here's a closer look at how several nominated actors - plus a couple of others - transformed for the big screen.
John C. Reilly |
'Stan & Ollie' In getting ready to play Oliver Hardy, half of the world's most famous comedy duo, Reilly referred to one of the funnyman's nicknames: Babe.
"He was called Babe because he looked like a chubby little baby from the time he was a chubby little baby to the time he was a grown man," Reilly said. "I got inspired by the name and said, 'Let's look at what some fat babies look like.' "
So he donned a fat suit, carrying weight as a baby's body does, and Oscar-winning makeup artist Mark Coulier used prosthetics to turn his features into Hardy's. It took three hours for Reilly to transform each morning, and another to take it all off at the end of the day.
"Mark was such a great painter, I couldn't tell where my skin was and where the piece was unless I felt it," the actor said.
Bradley Cooper
| 'A Star Is Born' As his own director, Cooper had the benefit of being able to portray Jackson Maine exactly as he saw fit. That included growing out his hair and beard; hiring Oscar-winning makeup artist Ve Neill to give him spray tans, darken his beard and make his eyes bloodshot for drunk scenes, as she told Vulture; and working with vocal coach Tim Monich to perfect the country-rocker's gravelly voice and twangy, not "too country" accent.
"It hurt my esophagus. I would have pain for the first couple of months," Cooper told The Washington Post in the fall. "It's not only lowering your voice, it's speaking different rhythmically."
Charlize Theron
| 'Tully' Theron has transformed before, most memorably for her Oscar-winning turn in 2003's "Monster." For "Tully," in which she portrays a beleaguered mother of three young children, Theron turned to potato chips - which she had in her car, in her kitchen, in her trailer, even in her bathroom - to help her gain close to 50 pounds.
"What they say about 'what you eat is who you are' is so true, because I ate like a person who just didn't move, and I felt like that," she said on "The Ellen Show" in April. "I was lethargic and tired all the time, and that was a hard thing to break. Because it's more mental than it is almost physical."
Rosamund Pike | 'A Private War' Pike, an English actress, spent a year preparing for her role as late war correspondent Marie Colvin in "A Private War." She worked with a dialect coach to drop her voice an octave and adopt a Long Island accent, according to director Matthew Heineman, and spent months with a dance coach to learn how to move and carry herself as Marie did - holding tension in her neck and splaying her hands when she gesticulated, for example.
Designer Denise Kum helped with Pike's makeup, hair and prosthetics.
"It was remarkable to see how [Pike] turned into this woman who didn't obviously look or sound at all like her," Heineman said, later adding: "I was very astounded and blown away by Ros's performance."
Christian Bale | 'Vice' Bale frequently changes his weight to play different characters - as Trevor Reznik in "The Machinist," he shrank to just 120 pounds. But to play Richard B. Cheney in "Vice," Bale instead gained 40 pounds, by "eating a lot of pies," and, according to a recent piece published in the New York Times, wore fleshy prosthetics created using an identical mold of his head. After makeup, the actor bore features such as the former vice president's nose, his chin dimple and deep creases running from his nose to his jowls.
"He put on the suit, walked into the office with all of us, and everybody just died," prosthetics and makeup effect designer Greg Cannom told the Times. "I was just shocked. He looked just like him."
Margot Robbie | 'Mary Queen of Scots' How do you make such a modern beauty look like a smallpox-suffering Queen Elizabeth I? A prosthetic nose and boils, an array of wigs and a whole bunch of makeup. "Mary Queen of Scots" features at least five stages of the 16th-century monarch's evolution - what British makeup artist Jenny Shircore called her "fresh and pretty stage" to her balding, pancake makeup stage. For Shircore to accomplish the latter, Robbie would sit in the makeup chair for three hours.
"Jealousy and fear between the two women was about power, and they were both very aware of each other's beauty," Shircore told The Post in December, referring to the queen's rivalry with her cousin Mary. "When Elizabeth was losing her beauty because of the smallpox scarring, she harnessed what was left with makeup."
Nicole Kidman | 'Destroyer' In "Destroyer," Kidman plays a Los Angeles police detective who went undercover with a criminal gang years ago but is now, as director Karyn Kusama told Vanity Fair, a "middle-aged woman with a past that she wears on her face." This translated to makeup that displayed the effects of sun damage, sleep deprivation, stress and anger.
Kidman doesn't undergo extensive transformations as often as some of her peers do, according to Kusama, who added that the actress would rather be on the set than in the makeup chair. So they kept the makeup application process short, but still ended up with a character who looks as though she "wears her ugliness on the outside, all that smallness and bitterness."
Rami Malek | 'Bohemian Rhapsody' What stands out most about Malek's version of Freddie Mercury might be his large teeth. Makeup, hair and prosthetics designer Jan Sewell had originally asked a teeth specialist to create a prosthetic set comparable in size to the Queen frontman's, according to Variety, but that overwhelmed Malek's face. So it was scaled down.
The actor's jawline was already as strong as Mercury's, Sewell told the trade outlet, but his eyes were too far apart. So they tacked on a prosthetic nose that "pulled Rami's eyes together" and finished the looks with fake mustaches and a variety of wigs.
sonia.rao@washpost.com
Tilda Swinton | 'Suspiria' Remember Mark Coulier, the makeup artist from "Stan & Ollie"? He's back.
Swinton and director Luca Guadagnino long denied rumors that she was actually Lutz Ebersdorf, an "actor" who had been photographed in full costume and makeup during "Suspiria's" production, and who they both insisted played the elderly male psychoanalyst Dr. Josef Klemperer, one of the only men in the film.
But in October, Swinton came clean to the New York Times about Lutz's true identity, and Coulier revealed how he made Swinton and her "very feminine bone structure" seem more masculine. They committed to the bit.
"She had this nice, weighty set of genitalia," Coulier said. "She managed to get it out on set on a couple of occasions."

Year's best, trendiest diets revealed

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets of the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
U.S. News and World Report has released its annual rankings of the Best Diets for 2019, revealing the Mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.
Each diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on U.S. News and World Report rankings. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions this year.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.1/5 Weight Loss | 1.5/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.7/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
A healthy diet doesn't require a complete life change. Instead, make smarter choices more often when shopping, cooking and eating.

Misconduct in Federal Prisons Goes Unpunished, House Study Says

Texto completo: Misconduct in the federal prison system is widespread, tolerated and routinely covered up or ignored, including among senior officials, according to a congressional report released this week.
The report, by the House Subcommittee on National Security, found that a permissive environment in the Bureau of Prisons had often made lower-ranking employees targets of abuse -- including sexual assault and harassment -- by prisoners and staff members.
Inmates can easily exploit that culture of permissiveness, the report said. "If they know that an employee will get little support from management if harassed, that employee becomes a target."
The study underscores a New York Times investigation of federal prisons last year that found rampant sexual harassment, retaliation for those who spoke out and few consequences for those responsible.
"Some individuals deemed responsible for misconduct," the congressional report said, "were shuffled around, commended, awarded, promoted, or even allowed to retire with a clean record and full benefits before any disciplinary action could apply."
The Bureau of Prisons settled a large sexual discrimination case in 2017 after 524 current and former female guards, nurses and others at Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, near Orlando, said they had suffered years of abuse by male colleagues and prison inmates.
The women, who said they had been threatened with sexual assault and had to put up with inmates who exposed themselves whenever they approached, were awarded $20 million.
As part of the congressional report released this week, investigators reviewed thousands of pages of case files, arbitration documents and emails.
More than a dozen allegations against five federal prison wardens included assaulting an inmate, embezzlement, harassment, retaliation and creating a hostile work environment, according to the report, which did not include names. Those complaints were opened and closed within a single day, the report said, and the people who made the complaints were never told the cases had been closed.
The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on Friday, citing the partial federal government shutdown.
Wardens in federal prisons are given wide leeway in handling accusations of misconduct in their facilities. When an allegation is made against a staff member, the warden generally appoints a lieutenant to investigate the claim.
But the report found that lieutenants often have at least three supervisors, including captains and wardens, who sometimes seek to influence an investigation or obtain details that could lead to retaliation against those who make the complaints.
The report is the second time in recent years that significant problems have been uncovered in the disciplinary structure of the federal prison system.
In 2004, an investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General found that discipline was not fairly imposed and that wardens had far too much influence in the process.
The 2004 report determined that more than one in five prison employees who were found to have violated federal law or departmental policy -- including falsification of government documents, unprofessional conduct of a sexual nature and endangering the safety of others -- had received only an oral reprimand or no punishment at all.
"Although small differences between the process in 2004 and the present show B.O.P. made some improvements, the culture apparently remains," the congressional report released this week said.
In a case from 2017 described in the report, a female prison psychologist complained to a prison captain about being harassed by the warden, who despite having a history of sexual harassment claims made against him had been repeatedly promoted.
But after the captain informed a regional director about the harassment claim, he was told to apologize to the warden.
The director, according to the report, told the captain she was aware that the warden "has allegations of sexual harassment at all of the other institutions that he has been to, and he is still sitting in the warden's chair! People need to realize that and get over it!"
The captain was later stripped of his duties and transferred to another prison where he took a job as a lieutenant -- a demotion.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Andrew Rawson's cellphone beeped as he worked on a video in Traliant's New Jersey office.
The message wasn't from a friend or a telemarketer.
It was an email from a company seeking assistance from Traliant, which offers training courses and interactive videos about harassment in the workplace.
"We serve companies with 20 people, and other companies with 100,000 people," said Rawson, co-founder and chief learning officer at Traliant, which this past spring moved from its Montclair headquarters into a larger space in East Hanover.
"A year after #MeToo, preventing sexual harassment in the workplace remains in the spotlight and one of the top priorities for human resources professionals and their organizations," said Carole Walters, an editor at Traliant.
Walters said the company offers training on preventing discrimination and harassment in office settings, and has been expanding it to include to hospitality, industrial, manufacturing and health care sectors.
At Traliant, the goal is to teach people about laws on sexual and other types of harassment and how to behave accordingly, Rawson said.
"Before Traliant, [employers] trained you on the laws but had no idea if that made a difference in anybody's behavior," Rawson said.
"Now we're showing people how they can disrupt a harassment situation," Rawson said. "We're showing them how they should report a sexual harassment situation, knowing it's not easy to do that."
CEO and co-founder Mike Pallatta said training is a way to "create the conversation and raise awareness" about what is and isn't acceptable behavior in the workplace.
"Employees are being more sensitive to bad behavior," said Pallatta. "Little comments that you'd think were fine five years ago may not be today. There are things you have to be careful talking about."
How is sexual harassment defined? Sexual harassment is unlawfully harassing someone based on a person's sex and can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and verbal or physical harassment that has a sexual nature, Rawson explained.
Harassment is unwelcome conduct on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability or genetic information, which are characteristics protected under federal law.
"People tend to be unclear about these definitions because legally, only members of the 'protected classes' are protected from harassment or discrimination," Rawson said in an email. "However, in practical terms, no organization wants their people to harass or discriminate against anyone for any reason."
Lauren Hersh, national director of World Without Exploitation, a movement that aims to curb sexual exploitation and human trafficking, said people today have more of an understanding about what sexual harassment is in the workplace than they did five to 10 years ago.
"There's been such a transformation in our culture," Hersh said. "I don't think we're there yet but we're on our way.
"We're talking about these issues in a way we hadn't been five years ago," she noted.
Sexual harassment in the media It was a little over a year ago that The New York Times broke a story alleging decades of sexual harassment of multiple women by media mogul Harvey Weinstein.
A litany of cases followed. Host Matt Lauer was fired from the "Today" show amid a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations. Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson sued her boss Roger Ailes for sexual harassment and won a $20 million settlement. And former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly wrote a memoir, "Settle for More," detailing her experiences involving sexual harassment at Fox News.
Rosemarie Arnold, an attorney in Fort Lee, says the #MeToo Movement and "the Hollywood exposé of people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby" pushed victims to come forward.
"When it happens in Hollywood, people actually believe it's real, which is interesting," said Arnold, who has worked on about 250 sexual harassment cases over the past decade.
Arnold said her experience has been that individuals often hesitate to come forward because they are told by a supervisor or their harasser that nobody will believe them.
Now, she said, "Women and men feel a lot more comfortable coming forward and making accusations. They feel they'll be believed and that action will be taken to help them out," Arnold said.
What else is changing? A tax law affecting settlements went into effect last year, and may be problematic for employers and employees, said Montclair-based attorney Leslie Farber.
Farber said employers can no longer deduct settlement payments in sexual harassment cases that are considered confidential. Employees must pay taxes on the full amount of the settlement, including the attorney fees, which were formerly deductible, Farber said.
Farber said New Jersey employees are pushing to get rid of forced arbitration, which limits workers' right to discovery.
"This puts the employee at a significant disadvantage because so much of the information the employee needs to prove her or his case is in the employer's hand," Farber said in an email.
There is also a bill in the state Legislature that would prohibit non-disclosure agreements in sexual harassment cases, Farber said.
For Traliant, the #MeToo movement has presented an opportunity to get a message out about prevention.
The mindset people have about sexual harassment is changing, say Traliant's co-founders.
"It's about coming to an understanding of what really is acceptable behavior and having an appropriate amount of sensitivity," Pallatta said.

Texto completo: ASHEVILLE — Women's March co-president Tamika Mallory will deliver a keynote address next month as a part of UNC Asheville's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Week, the university said Tuesday.
Mallory plans to speak Jan. 24 at UNCA's Lipinsky Auditorium, about a week after the third annual Women's March takes place in Washington D.C. and communities nationwide. She was one of the organizers of the first Women's March in 2017 that drew about 500,000 people to Washington, and more than 7,000 participants in Asheville.
In a news release Tuesday, Mallory said she and fellow Women's March leaders "believe that we can be the bridge to connect different groups in the name of our shared liberation." Her address caps a week the university said focuses on King's legacy through activities, workshops and a day of community service.
"We don't just step into difficult spaces, we create new ones," Mallory, 38, said. "I am guided by the loving principles of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., though I have fallen short of them at times. And it is with the belief that 'non-violence seeks to win friendship and understanding' and 'non-violence seeks to defeat injustice, not people' that we organized a march on January 21, 2017, that 5 million people participated in worldwide; and we have been guided by those values the whole way through."
Mallory also is known for her efforts to curb gun violence in New York City, where she is a native. She is credited for her roles in helping develop New York City's Crisis Management System and working with President Barack Obama's administration on gun control policy, a biography provided by UNCA shows.
This year's keynote address was delivered by Michelle Alexander, author of "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness," which was a New York Times bestseller. The previous year was by Walter M. Kimbrough, president of Dillard University in New Orleans.
Tickets are not required to attend Mallory's address with seating on a first-come, first-served basis. The event begins at 7 p.m.

Texto completo: Andrew Bujalski's "Support the Girls" hits Hulu. And Netflix tests interactive storytelling with "Black Mirror: Bandersnatch."
What's Streaming
SUPPORT THE GIRLS (2018) on Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. Regina Hall plays the manager of a Hooters-esque Texas restaurant in Andrew Bujalski's subtly directed comedy, whose fans include The New York Times's co-chief film critics and Barack Obama, who included it in a list of his favorite movies of 2018. It follows Lisa (Hall), the headstrong leader of an ensemble of tight-knit waitresses. The story takes place mostly during a single workday, one that's full of trials, tribulations and churlish patrons. Bujalski "likes to foreground people and places that other moviemakers ignore or use as atmosphere," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "He sees these women, and invites you to see them, too."
BLACK MIRROR: BANDERSNATCH (2018) on Netflix. Technological skepticism meets "Choose Your Own Adventure" in this latest installment of Charlie Brooker's extremely popular sci-fi anthology series, which comes in the form of a full-length movie. How full-length it is depends on the viewer: In what has been seen as a move by Netflix to test interest in gamified television storytelling, "Bandersnatch" allows watchers to make choices that affect what happens next in the story, and ultimately the ending. The length varies depending on what choices the viewer makes. But the story's premise is always the same: It's the mid-1980s, and a young, stressed-out English programmer (played by Fionn Whitehead) is adapting a book into a video game.
COMEDIANS OF THE WORLD on Netflix. This multilingual sampler plate of international stand-up comedy features comics from around the world delivering half-hour sets. They tackle subjects like ethically produced smartphones (in a set by the French comedian Shirley Souagnon) or Turkish coffee (in a set by the Indian comedian Aditi Mittal).
MUD (2013) on Amazon, Google Play, Hulu, iTunes and Vudu. In small-town Arkansas, two boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), explore an island on the Mississippi River and make two discoveries: a boat wedged in a tree and a sun-kissed runaway who's been living in it. That man, Mud (Matthew McConaughey), comes to rely on the boys as they supply him with food. He in turn supplies them with colorful stories in this coming-of-age drama from the director Jeff Nichols. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote: "Mr. Nichols's screenplay is perhaps a little too heavily plotted, especially toward the end, when everything comes together neatly and noisily, but he more than compensates with graceful rhythm, an unfussy eye for natural beauty and a sure sense of character and place."
What's on TV
BEN-HUR (1959) 8 p.m. on TCM. Watch one of Hollywood's biggest films on the small screen when TCM shows this epic, which turns 60 this year.

'Orange Is the New Black' ready to tie up loose ends

Texto completo: Q: Is "Orange Is the New Black" coming back with a new season? There are plenty of loose ends that could be tied up.
A: The Netflix series will be back in summer 2019 for a seventh season, which will also be its last. The end of the sixth season saw central character Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling) getting early release from prison and the seventh will include a look at her life on the outside. Executive producer Tara Herrman told The Hollywood Reporter her release will contrast with what nonwhite, less privileged inmates on the series will experience.

Q: I watch "The Honeymooners" all the time. One of the episodes is "Mama Loves Mambo." It's about a mambo instructor who moves into the building. Can you tell me the actor's name?
A: Charles Korvin played Carlos the mambo instructor. He was an actor who "made a career playing gentleman thieves and philandering husbands," The New York Times said after Korvin died in 1998 at age 90.
Born in Hungary and educated in France, he was also a documentary-maker and had a steady movie-acting career from 1945 until about 1951, co-starring with Merle Oberon in three movies, before he was caught up in the Hollywood blacklist. He then worked in TV, including on "The Honeymooners" and on "Zorro," returning to the big screen in 1965.

Q: What happened to the Australian actor who played Jack the Mountie on "When Calls the Heart"?
A: Daniel Lissing left the series when his contract ended, with Jack killed off on the series. Lissing said after the Jack's death episode aired that the decision to leave was "for reasons that are very personal to me" but did not elaborate, as ETonline.com noted.
He's still friendly with the cast, telling ET in November that he still talks almost daily with co-star Erin Krakow. He has been taking on other projects, such as the recent Hallmark movie "Christmas in Love," where he co-starred with Brooke D'Orsay.

Q: It's not fair that OWN canceled "Love Is" because of the executive producer. His wife is the producer! Please explain. It's not fair to the actors.
A: As you know, executive producer Salim Akil has been accused of assaulting actress Amber Dixon Brenner along with the claim they had a long affair; Akil is married to Mara Brock Akil, producer on "Love Is." Salim Akil reportedly called Brenner's accusations "totally untrue" while acknowledging a past relationship with Brenner. Still, OWN decided not to go ahead with a previous plan for a second season of the show.
The announcement of the cancellation noted that the series was "inspired by the real-life love story" of the Akils, which made some observers believe that the off-camera events tainted how people would view the characters on the show. As for the actors, Ebony.com noted that "cast and producers will still be paid for Season 2 due to contractual obligations established during the show's initial renewal."

Q: Freeform aired "The Santa Clause" and "The Santa Clause 3," but not "The Santa Clause 2." Was the movie banned for some reason? I can't recall seeing "Santa Clause 2" on any channel this season.
A: This is a question that has popped up from time to time for years, both about Freeform and its earlier incarnation, ABC Family. The short answer is the channel does not have the rights to the second film, and it has aired instead on other channels. This year, for instance, it was on AMC.

The impact may not be like being kicked by a mule.

But the movie this new year is nevertheless a film worth seeing, if only because of Clint Eastwood.

It is his film "The Mule," a story about an aging Michigan horticulturist who becomes a drug runner -- a mule with a pickup truck -- after his marriage and business go bust.

Clint Eastwood plays Earl Stone, a rotten husband, rotten father (probably a rotten golfer, too) who, facing foreclosure, is offered a job that requires some driving, something he loves to do in his battered old pickup.

He is unaware during the first run from the southern border to Detroit that he is hauling drugs from a Mexican cartel, but he soon finds out. The money is so great, though, that he becomes hooked -- not on drugs, but on the cash.

He gets away with it for a long time, mainly because he is an old geezer in his 80s who nobody -- including the cops -- pay much attention to. The money allows him to redeem himself with his family. He pays for his granddaughter's education and wedding.

A World War II combat veteran, he also bails out the local VFW when it runs into financial trouble.

He becomes a legend in the drug trade. He is called Tata, which is Spanish slang for grandfather. It all comes to an end when he is finally apprehended by DEA agent Colin Bates, played by Bradley Cooper.

Eastwood's portrait of Stone, who is about the same age as Eastwood (pushing 90) is so sympathetic that Bates is almost apologetic for having to arrest the old gent and send him to prison.

Whatever happened to Dirty Harry, the Harry who would have blown the man's head off with his .44 Magnum? The Dirty Harry who, taunting the bad guy, takes out his .44 Magnum and snarls, "Go ahead, punk, make my day?" Or, who says, " 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?"

The answer is that Dirty Harry got old, just like Clint Eastwood and Earl Stone. So, instead of the Bradley Cooper character pulling out a gun, he asks solicitously about the cuts on Stone's face and tells him to "Hang in there."

Eastwood is so sympathetic to the Stone character that nowhere in the film is there any serious mention of the thousands of lives destroyed by the hundreds of kilos of cocaine that the mule brought into the Detroit area.

Nor is there any mention of how rich Stone became as a carrier for the Mexican cartels, or what he did with that money.

Earl Stone, the character that Eastwood plays, in real life was Leo Sharp, a failed day-lily farmer who ended up hauling into Detroit more cocaine than it had ever seen before.

New York Times writer Sam Dolnick described Sharp as a "one-man cocaine fountain."

Dolnick in 2014 wrote a New York Times Magazine piece on Sharp that was used for a screenplay that became the movie.

However, there was more drama and information about Sharp and his drug career that was left out of the movie than was put in, including his death after serving one year of a three-year prison sentence handed down when he was 90 years old.

Sharp became a drug mule after one of the Mexican workers on his failed day-lily farm introduced him to drug dealers, who deliberately hired couriers who played against type.

One such driver was a former heavy-equipment operator with a clean driving record who was out on disability after four heart attacks.

"Leo is the perfect courier for the cartel," a DEA agent told Dolnick. "He has a legitimate ID, he's an older guy, he wouldn't be pegged as a drug runner and he has no criminal record."

The question at Sharp's trial was whether the old drug mule was "savvy or senile," according to Dolnick.

The prosecution said that Sharp was shrewd enough to have avoided suspicion, arrest and prosecution for over a decade. In addition, they pointed out, the number of "wrecked lives" Sharp left behind him was simply "staggering."

In court Sharp said, "I'm heartbroken. I did what I did, but it's done."

Sharp was released from prison in 2015 and died a year later. He was 94.

The movie may miss a beat or two but, being deluged with drugs as we are, it is worth seeing. It is vintage Clint Eastwood.

(Note: Locally, Canton police a week ago arrested a 75-year old man from Ashburnham for allegedly carrying 150 pounds of marijuana, worth $500,000, in his truck.)

The program also features interviews with her close friends Chevy Chase and Lorne Michaels, as well as other "S.N.L." alums influenced by her work, like Bill Hader, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph. In his review, the critic Jason Zinoman of The New York Times called "Love, Gilda" "a very affectionate reminder of her brief and brilliant career, a heartfelt love letter whose title might be more accurate without the comma."
