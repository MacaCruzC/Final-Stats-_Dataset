Texto completo: FARMINGTON —Regional School Unit 9 directors chose Tuesday, Sept. 28, to keep present COVID-19 safety guidelines in place amid anti-masking concerns from parents in the board’s first check-in on the policies.
As the guidelines approved on Aug. 24 stand, all students and staff are required to wear face masks while indoors. Face shields are allowed according to the specifications of their Individualized Educational Plan/504 Plan or “with a medically documented need.”
Superintendent Chris Elkington and Director of Curriculum Laura Columbia suggested maintaining the guidelines because of rapidly increasing COVID-19 case numbers in Franklin County.
“So far, September has been the month with the highest average cases since January 2021 in Franklin County,” according to The New York Times. “Because of very high COVID-19 transmission in Franklin County right now, unvaccinated people are at a very high risk,” according to the newspaper.
Elkington said the universal masking mandate has, in part, prevented any in-school COVID-19 transmissions since the beginning of the school year.
However, parents and community members are still speaking out against the mandate. At the Sept. 14 meeting, former Director Jesse Sillanpaa resigned because he disagreed with the policy, among other reasons. Another parent raised similar concerns during the public comment session.
Earlier in the meeting, Director Kirk Doyle asked “given that we’ve seen n0 in-school transmissions, are we being too aggressive” with quarantining guidelines?
“Is the (Center for Disease Control) guidance hard and fast or is there some wiggle room?” he asked.
Columbia said the CDC guidelines “are very clear” now and the district cannot deviate from them.
Since the beginning of the school year, 228 students across the district have had to quarantine because of 32 positive cases.
Doyle also asked that the district provide better data on the number of students who have not had to quarantine specifically because of the universal masking mandate to affirm that the mandate is protecting students and decreasing the need for quarantining.
Some parents have also raised concerns about confusion over quarantining guidelines, which was addressed at the Sept. 14 meeting.
Columbia said the district has “realized a better system for explaining what exemption kids fall into when talking about quarantining” with parents of close contacts. These exemptions include close contacts who are vaccinated, participate in pooled testing or have tested positive for COVID-19 within 90 days of the exposure.
Columbia also said the district has acquired BinaxNOW rapid tests and staff throughout the district are approved to administer them. The district will use rapid tests when a pool tests positive.
“There’s lots of options (for using the rapid tests) but we don’t have the capacity for them yet,” Columbia said.
The board also announced that Dee Robinson of Chesterville and Mark Prentiss of Industry have been appointed to the board following the resignations of Sillanpaa and Craig Stickney. Prentiss has previously served on the board.
In other business, Director Cherieann Harrison raised the topic of issues with traffic flow for parent drop off and pick up at W.G. Mallet School. She brought up the issue while the board was discussing how the district is applying to use American Rescue Plan/ESSER III grant funding.
Harrison said the board has talked about conducting a traffic study for quite some time and suggested the board make this issue a priority.
“We’ve had a lot of grants that have come through and this is something that’s been bypassed,” Harrison said.
Elkington said that application for this current grant was due the next day, Wednesday, Oct. 29, and it would not be possible to add this issue in. However, Elkington agreed the issue needed to be addressed and suggested it be focused on in future meetings.

Texto completo: RANGELEY — It may not be snowmaking season just yet, but autumn is here. And, with pleasing temperatures and eye-popping foliage, it’s a great time to plan a trip to Saddleback Mountain for the weekend to enjoy some festive fall events and recreation. This October the resort in partnership with the Hight Family of Dealerships and Bigelow Brewing Company is kicking off the start of the upcoming season with a free family-friendly fall festival and a traditional Oktoberfest style celebration. Both events are open to the public. (Children are permitted into Oktoberfest, but not something that the resort is trying to encourage).
In addition to the festivities, autumn is a great time to get fit for the upcoming ski season by spending the day hiking up Saddleback’s Mountain Ski Resort and to the summit which is part of the Maine Appalachian Trail. Just in time for the Fall Festival, Saddleback will officially open the new South Branch mountain bike trails to the public for the very first time on Saturday, Oct. 2. For more information on hiking, the mountain and upcoming events, visit www.saddlebackmaine.com.
The ticket office will also be open during these events for those interested in picking up or purchasing a season pass or multiday ticket deal for the 2021/2022 ski season.
Following are event dates and highlights:
Fall Festival at Saddleback
Date: Saturday, Oct. 2
Time: 10 a.m. — 4 p.m.
Cost: FREE (Must reserve a “free” ticket through Eventbrite)
Saddleback and the Hight Family of Dealerships are hosting a FREE community-centered day of fun to say thank you to the Saddleback family for a successful season. Families are invited to enjoy a special day of festive activities including kid’s face and pumpkin painting, pumpkin ring toss, haystack hide and seek, festive photo ops, a costume contest and special hot cider and donut treats.
For those interested in mountain biking, the new South Branch mountain bike trails will officially open to the public. Saddleback’s summer trail crew has been busy hand-cutting single-track mountain bike trails in the South Branch area of the mountain. Trail access will open at 10 a.m. and will require a $10 bike pass and a signed liability waiver, both of which visitors can find at the ticket office.
Starting at 1 p.m., live music by the Maine-based band Cadagan will kick off on the deck and there will also be a bonfire at the base area. A potluck style lunch will be served, so families are urged to bring their favorite dish to share.
The ticket office will be open starting at 10 a.m., providing a perfect time to pick up a season pass for the year. For more information on the event schedule and free tickets, visit, https://www.eventbrite.com/e/170181520509.

Editor’s Note: In this new series, Franklin Journal Staff Writer Kay Neufeld will learn from local artisans, artists, creatives etc. on how to make some of their signature creations.
FARMINGTON — On a Friday afternoon in late September, I was invited by woodworker John Nichols and his apprentice, Emma Schurink, to join them in their shop, learn some tricks of the trade, and make myself some cutting boards from start to finish.
Nichols has been working with wood for as long as he can remember, starting with his first job cleaning up a job site with his dad in Cape Elizabeth. Nichols said he’s been in carpentry and woodworking ever since.
Ten years back, Nichols began John’s Chip Off the Old Block, where he creates everything from cutting boards and spoons, tables and cabinetry to cribbage boards. Nichols is also known for his resin art, a medium he created by mixing resin and wood chips together.
At the time he started the woodworking shop, Nichols was still working as a carpenter. When it became clear that he had to choose one avenue, Nichols chose his passion and began running the shop full time.
Schurink began working with Nichols a year ago, when she “serendipitously” walked into Vera’s Iron and Vine (where Nichols used to be a part-owner) and suggested he take her on as an apprentice.
Nichols calls Schurink his first “blank slate apprentice,” teaching her everything she now knows and excels at in woodworking.
Back to that Friday afternoon, I began the day by watching Nichols and Schurink finish up some work. Nichols was using his table saw to cut the wood I’d be using for my cutting board.
Truthfully, I grimaced through that part, looking away as Nichols’ fingers got so close to the saw I surely thought they’d get chopped off. Nichols of course knows his limits. He appears to have a symbiotic relationship with his tools.
Nevertheless, given how long Nichols has been doing this, he’s seen a few accidents. Those he mentioned sounded unpleasant enough (a saw-sliced thumb, perhaps) that they instilled in me the fear of God and I consequently approached the machines with immense caution.
After “ripping up” larger pieces of wood for me to compile my cutting board, I got to do what Schurink describes as the “creative part” of the process. This involves choosing from the many different kinds of wood in Nichols’ shop and arranging them to my heart’s desire.
Schurink is very intentional about fleshing out her vision for the board.
“I’m looking at each piece (of wood) and really choosing,” she said.
Meanwhile, Nichols just goes for it — picking and arranging at random. With such beautiful wood and the care put into the process, it seems pretty hard for these boards to come out looking bad.
Though Nichols and Schurink have different methods, they bond over admiring the wood and “geeking out over the grain.”
When I said I wanted to get it “right,” Nichols affirmed “there is no wrong way.”
Much of the wood Nichols uses is locally sourced in Maine, including maple, cherry and ash.
With my unfortunate penchant for expensive taste, I ended up picking some of the more pricey and lusher woods, bloodwood and purpleheart. Both are sourced from the equator region. Their colors are rich and and vibrant — more colorful than I expected wood to look like naturally.
After bringing my creative vision to fruition, the technical work began.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-26648802 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/IMG_2738-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1333" />
First, we glued and clamped the wood to dry over night.
I returned the following week to finish up my work. We began the new day with using the planer to flatten and even out the board. This part of the process takes a bit more muscle and caution, the first moment of the day I was concerned about losing a finger.
The board’s final form was starting to take shape. The planer revealed the grain of the wood, what really makes it shine.
All throughout the process, Nichols and Schurink would correct my technique, showing me what it takes for them to be most efficient and successful. With an anxious nature and the concern that I would mess up along the way, this was much appreciated.
Next, came the step I feared the most: using the chop saw. I am a particularly clumsy human being. However, Nichols assured me “if you’re cautious, you’re not going to get hurt.”
I wasn’t excellent at the chop saw and Nichols had to swoop in a few times to correct my work. Nevertheless, I write this with all 10 fingers accounted for.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-26648805 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/IMG_2933-1-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1333" />
Nichols next taught me how to route the edges, or round them out so they aren’t blunt. That process felt the most risky to me because it was the closest my hands got to the tools.
It was not lost on me that it took me triple the time to route a board that it took Nichols. Of course it would. But my perfectionist ego still came out a bit bruised and I tried to speed up with each board I routed.
After routing the board, we neared the end of the job. Schurink taught me how to sand, a bit more time consuming and back-aching than the other steps. However, sanding was one of my favorite steps.
This step was quite meditative. I found myself repeatedly zoning out, snapping back to reality and remembering I was handling a tool.
“What do you think about while you work?” I asked. Both agreed that they zone out as well, thinking about what’s on their to-do list or coming up with new ideas. Though with their muscle memory it’s fairly less risky to get lost in thought.
Nichols and Schurink, at this point good friends, also said they will stop what they’re working on to share a random thought here and there.
With a coat of oil and a quick buff, I was done. It was incredibly satisfying to see my finished product and take my creations home.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-26648811 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/IMG_2939.jpg" alt="" width="1333" height="1000" />
What I found most impressive by John’s Chip Off the Old Block was the ingenuity flowing in the shop. No wood goes to waste, instead turned into new and unique products.
Schurink has been creating earrings from scraps in the shop. Nichols creates his resin art. Other wood gets burned, recycled or used at local farms.
Some pieces of wood are kept around to be used in future work when the right idea or moment comes along. Nichols has been holding on to one distinctly beautiful block of maple for five years.
“We’re not really saving anything, you just don’t throw anything away,” Nichols said.
I left my time with Nichols and Schurink especially proud for a variety of reasons: that I could make something so beautiful with no experience, nary a splinter, and accident free.
Here’s to hoping my safety record stays that way the next time.

Texto completo: ROCKLAND — Ruby Haylock and Billy Visconti both shot low scores of 36 to lead Leavitt to a victory in the KVAC Class B Shootout on Thursday at Rockland Golf Club.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-26721786" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/thumbnail_image-2-1-e1633053818112.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="513" />
The Hornets finished with a team score of 158, easily beating runner-up Maranacook (178). Maine Central Institute, the other team in the three-team competition, was third at a combined 184. With the win, Leavitt earned qualification to the Class B team state championship.
Jade Haylock (43), Alexis McCormick (45), Aidan Lind (43) and A.J. Davis (46) were the other scorers for Leavitt.
Wyatt Folsom (40) led Maranacook and Owen Moore (43) paced MCI.
In a battle of four Class A teams; Brunswick, Edward Little, Hampden Academy, and Messalonskee, all of whom won their regional titles to get to Thursday’s match at Brunswick Golf Club, also known as the KVAC A ‘shootout’, it came down to the wire between Brunswick and Messalonskee. In the end, Brunswick took home the Class A conference title by a mere four strokes to earn the automatic bid to the team state championship on Oct. 9 at Natanis Golf Club in Vassalboro.
Brunswick beat Mt. Ararat on Monday to earn its spot out of its pod. Hampden Academy outlasted Bangor and Brewer to earn a spot, Edward Little beat Lewiston and Oxford Hills, while Messalonskee downed Mt. Blue to earn theirs.
The winner of Thursday’s shootout was determined by the combined lowest four scores by each team. Brunswick’s low of 174 was good enough to top Hampden’s 178. Edward Little was fourth with a score of 194.

Brandon Bearce of Messalonskee was the low medalist on the day with his 3-over round of 40. Brunswick’s Charlie Austin and Stromick each shot 41, while top Edward Little golfer Conner Turcotte had a 44. Eli Vine paced Hampden with his round of 42.
The three teams that didn’t receive the automatic bid to the team state championship match will have to earn a spot on Oct. 5 in the KVAC individual and team qualifier, also set to take place at Natanis Golf Course.

Question 1: the CMP corridor

Texto completo: To the Editor:
First CMP tried to distance their abysmal reputation from the CMP corridor project, designed to deliver power to Massachusetts through the heart of western Maine. Many saw through this ploy and, despite being subjected to a $30 million PR campaign, Mainers remained unconvinced that it’s a good deal. Now, just weeks before Election Day, CMP has again shifted tactics. Now, they don’t mention the project at all. CMP has propped up new organizations and hired new spokespeople to spread fear and misinformation about Question 1. My hope is that Mainers again see through CMP’s nonsense.
Question 1 does NOT:
• Create retroactivity – this already exists in statute
• Put roads, bridges, or your back deck at risk
Question 1 does:
• Affirm the Legislature and the court’s finding that the lease to cross public lands cannot be hashed out behind closed doors
• Protect critical wildlife habitat in the Upper Kennebec region from high impact transmission lines
• Require a simple majority vote for high impact transmission lines that are greater than 50 miles in length
For those of you who are still on the fence, know this – Question 1 is your opportunity to stop the CMP Corridor, uphold the Maine Constitution and inject much-needed transparency into the approval process for similar projects down the road. Question 1 is necessary to prevent unelected bureaucrats from pushing unpopular projects that put the interests of foreign corporations first. If we don’t act now, Maine will become nothing more than an extension cord for southern New England, or as my good friend Darryl says, a cold New Jersey. Please vote YES Question 1 to ban the CMP Corridor on November 2.

Texto completo: DEAR SUN SPOTS: Keys were found in the parking lot at the VFW Hall in South Paris on Friday, Sept. 24. This key ring also contains a Rite-Aid key tag and a birthday/horoscope key tag. If you’ve lost your keys and were at the VFW, please call 890-8176 to identify them. — Rich, no town
ANSWER: Like I always say, I encourage everyone who has lost or found something to write to Sun Spots!
DEAR SUN SPOTS: You asked to receive information about my request for a 1965 Edward Little class ring (Sept. 23 Sun Spots). I’m pleased to say I found what I was looking for and have arranged for the woman to send it to me. This ring is for my sister who lost her Edward Little statue on the ring. She will be very pleased to get a new one. — Carol, no town
ANSWER: Excellent!
DEAR SUN SPOTS: Why are they talking about two Question 1s on the November ballot? — Peter, no town
ANSWER: Here is the explanation of Question 1 from News Center Maine. I hope it helps.
When Mainers receive their ballots in November, Question 1 will read: “Do you want to ban the construction of high-impact electric transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec Region and to require the Legislature to approve all other such projects anywhere in Maine, both retroactively to 2020, and to require the Legislature, retroactively to 2014, to approve by a two-thirds vote such projects using public land?”
The referendum question was initiated by citizens, who collected more than 80,000 signatures, sending the law proposal to the Maine Legislature. But the Legislature did not act on the measure and sent it to the voters in the November ballot.
The question stems from opposition to the New England Clean Energy Connect, or NECEC, a hydropower project stretching from the Quebec/Maine border to New Hampshire. While the majority of the project leans on existing power lines, new lines would be added from the Canadian border through The Forks in Maine.
In short, a “Yes” vote on Question 1 supports a ban on the construction of electric transmission lines defined as high impact in the Upper Kennebec Region, including the NECEC.
It would also require the state Legislature to approve high-impact electric transmission line projects through a two-thirds majority vote.
A “No” vote on question one opposes a ban and supports allowing the construction of the NECEC project to continue. It would also mean the state Legislature would not be required to approve high-impact electric transmission line projects moving forward.
Permits have been approved for the project and construction is already underway. However, because this question includes a need for “retroactive” approval, if the “Yes” campaign wins, a two-thirds majority in the Legislature would be required to approve the NECEC and other similar projects that passed in the past seven years.
Another part of this issue is already playing out in the courts. A judge ruled last month that the Bureau of Public Lands violated the constitution when it issued permits in 2014 and again in 2020 to allow CMP to lease a mile of public land for the corridor. CMP has appealed that decision.

WIL KRAMLICH: OK, here is the annual “I can’t believe we’re already halfway through the season, but it feels like the season only just started” comment. I don’t know about you, but I feel like it really does happen every year, and it’s not just me. An eight-game (nine games for some divisions) regular season just flies by, and once it starts it’s in high gear. So now that we’re past that reality check, let’s talk about some of the biggest surprises in our area. Is it that Telstar is undefeated and having maybe its best season ever? Is it that Oxford Hills beat one of the Class A big boys? Is it that Gray-New Gloucester had never won a homecoming game before?

ADAM ROBINSON: I have to be honest, when I talked to Oxford Hills coach Mark Soehren during the Lobster Bowl this summer and he told me that last year was going to be the Vikings’ year, I didn’t know how much I believed him. I know coaches talk up their teams, and I also knew that Bonny Eagle and Thornton were also in Class A. Now I think that this might be the Vikings’ year, as well, after their huge win over the Scots last weekend. What a big win.
In eight-man football, Telstar is so tough. The Rebels had some penalties and some turnovers, but they pick each other up and they made enough big plays to put away a pesky Maranacook team to win their fourth straight game. And the players think this team is much different from the 2019 squad that won three consecutive games early in the season then lost the remainder of its games.
I also think Gray-New Gloucester’s win on Friday night in the pouring rain was awesome to watch. The team had a full bleacher section cheering it on, and after a tough first half the Patriots turned it on in the second for a commanding win.
KRAMLICH: For everyone outside of Oxford Hills, the Vikings’ win over Bonny Eagle seemed like a statement, but it also seemed like one they have been ready to make for a few years. I would imagine that those within the program would say the win wasn’t a surprise, though they’re probably relieved they proved their potential.
Having been part of the Gray-NG program and following it ever since, I’m not totally surprised they hadn’t ever won on homecoming, but I’m happy for this year’s team and it’s nice to see the fan support.
I also saw the Patriots lose to Telstar two years ago when the Rebels started making a statement in eight-man football. Still, I’d have to say Telstar’s stellar start is the biggest surprise to me. The Rebels often get (unintentionally) overlooked, with Bethel being an outpost of our Lewiston central office, and the football program’s history hasn’t been ripe with success. Add to that a year off, which included graduating the Rebels’ star quarterback from the 2019 team, and they were a question mark heading into this season. But what a statement the Rebels have made so far, and they’re a team we can’t ignore now.
Should I have been surprised? Should I keep on buying in?
ROBINSON: I would buy stock in this year’s Telstar squad. The Rebels have a lot of juniors and seniors who have played together for a while, they are led by a soon-to-be-Marine in Andrew Leighton on both sides of the ball and they hold each other accountable. They’re tough, score enough and can win messy games, as evidenced by Saturday’s victory.
I am interested to see how Mountain Valley, Spruce Mountain and Dirigo continue their eight-man seasons, including a big showdown between the Cougars and Falcons on Friday night. It seems like they’re all finding their stride a bit in eight-man and could be playoff contenders for a round or two, maybe more.
KRAMLICH: Our area eight-man programs are becoming as much-see as our remaining 11-man teams. And it’s nice to see that trifecta start finding success after they all were in some decline in 11-man football in recent years. Now they’re playing catch-up to the momentum that Telstar has found in the ever-growing eight-man ranks.

TURNER — Once New England’s largest egg producer, Hillandale Farms has laid off an unknown number of workers and closed one of its plants here, but told the state it doesn’t have any intentions of closing entirely.
The Maine Department of Labor reached out Thursday to provide Rapid Response help sessions for affected employees, but a spokeswoman declined to say how many were laid off.
Hillandale Farms told the Maine Department of Agriculture that it was closing Plant 1 on Sept. 19, spokesman Jim Britt said. At the same time, farm officials signaled that Plant 3 would remain open and “there is no intention of closing and moving out of state, is what we were told,” Britt said.
It was unclear how many plants, closed or open, the former DeCoster Egg Farm has.
Multiple messages to Hillandale Farms and its parent company were not returned.
Turner Town Manager Kurt Schaub said he’s seen the farm, which is Turner’s single-largest taxpayer, shrink over the past several years.
“What it has to do with, to our knowledge anyway, is the apparent increase in demand for cage-free eggs versus the type of operation that that farm is set up for,” Schaub said. “We have heard some rumor that they could be exiting Maine. We have expressed an interest in speaking with them about what the future might hold for the site but have not set up anything concrete as of yet.”
Indications that some of the operation has shut down are “pretty obvious,” he said. “There are several parts of the complex that have been empty for several years. There are a number of outward signs.”
Last year, during a discussion about making Maine a cage-free-eggs state, a Turner lawmaker estimated that Hillandale had gone from a high of 5 million egg-laying chickens to close to 1 million.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-26719647 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/26714457_SJ.BIZeggs2P.100121.jpg" alt="" width="1503" height="1000" />
Stephen Vendemia, president of parent-company Hillandale Farms Conn, said in written testimony for that proposal that Hillandale was “by far the largest supplier of eggs to Maine’s market” and that the company’s future expansions would only be in facilities with cage-free chickens.
“However, we have also made it clear that there is absolutely no way that we can commit to serving Maine with cage-free eggs from the Turner farm by (Dec. 31, 2024), or by any specific date thereafter,” he wrote. “There are just too many variables in the commitments which will have to be in place to guarantee supplying Maine out of Turner.”
That bill died last November, according to the Maine Legislature website.
When Hillandale took over the lease for the former DeCoster Egg Farm in 2015 from Moark LLC, the facility had roughly 2.3 million chickens.

When I got home, I said, “There’s something big going on at the hospital. A fire, maybe. Or a bomb threat.”
We scoured the Internet, but couldn’t find anything. A couple of hours later, there were still no reports.
On a website that streams emergency service radio communications, I found out what was happening. Eavesdropping on fire and rescue radios, I learned that there was smoke in the hospital and that emergency services were on hand to evacuate patients.
A couple of days later, I told a friend about the situation and said, “I’m thinking about buying a police scanner.”
“Don’t waste your money,” he said. “Soon all emergency radios are going to be encrypted and police scanners will be useless.”
I’m not from Missouri, but spent enough time in the Show-Me State for that attitude to rub off. Rather than take my friend’s word for it, I researched the topic of emergency services encrypting their radios. Here’s what I learned.
There is nothing in FCC regulations or Maine law to prevent police and other agencies from encrypting their radio communications.
The process is expensive.
A dozen or so major cities in the U.S. have encrypted police radios.
In Maine, both Lewiston and Auburn recently encrypted their police radios, a project that cost around 4.5 million dollars.
As time goes on, more and more police forces, large and small, will encrypt.
Fire and ambulance radios will probably not be encrypted. Home scanners will still be able to listen to them.
That takes care of the what, now let’s look at the why. Arguments in favor of encryption can be boiled down to two issues: safety and privacy.
We have all seen movies and TV shows in which bad guys used police scanners to listen in and outwit law enforcement. It has happened in real life, too. But there are issues that extend beyond criminals eluding the law.
There’s the safety of the officers responding to a dangerous situation.
And there are hazards caused by people showing up to see what’s going on. Suddenly an officer, already in a personally dangerous situation, has the safety of a crowd of gawkers to worry about.
And then there’s the privacy issue. Most people don’t want their name, address, Social Security number, or driver’s license number to be heard on an open police broadcast, be it as a victim, suspect, or witness.
Arguments against encryption boil down to a right to know.
I’m in favor of police radios being encrypted, but not those of fire and other emergency services.
The issue is a hot one. If it is something you care about, don’t depend on my research or opinion. Pretend you are from Missouri and find out for yourself.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — A British singer, songwriter and actor who blazed a trail of musical trends and pop fashion, David Bowie is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. His career was marked by a creative restlessness in which he was constantly reinventing himself, his music and his work across the decades.
“Space Oddity,” his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart was released in 1969. In 1972, during the glam rock era, Bowie created his flamboyant Ziggy Stardust persona, winning him widespread popularity with his single “Starman” and “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.”
“Life on Mars?” a song with cryptic lyrics and piano by keyboardist Rick Wakeman, was first released on Bowie’s 1971 album Hunky Dory. The Daily Telegraph ranked the song number one in their “100 Greatest Songs of All Time.”
His music evolved throughout his career, and from “Space Oddity,” to “Blackstar,” his final album in 2016, Bowie is estimated at having sold over 100 million records worldwide. He was awarded 10 platinum albums in the UK, five platinum albums in the U.S., inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and named the “Greatest Rock Star Ever” by Rolling Stone posthumously in 2016.
In addition, he held leading roles in several feature films and supporting roles in dozens more. He also appeared on several television series and won a Daytime Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Special Class Special in 2003.
The UMF New Commons events focused on “Life on Mars?” will run between Oct. 2 and Oct. 25. A face covering is required for indoor events.
Maxi Glamour, “Life on Mars?” Drag Show and Workshop
Oct., 2, 12 – 2:30 p.m.
Join host Maxi Glamour – award-wining drag artist from St. Louis, Arabella LaDessé — Boston Drag Idol 2019 and Portland’s Blackstone’s Princess 2020, and Jakk Bloodstone — acclaimed New England-based drag artist, for an afternoon exploring the intersection of queerness and science fiction through David Bowie’s work. The event will feature drag performances, dialogue with the artists and a craft workshop.
“David Bowie 101” by Stephen Grandchamp
Oct. 6, 11:45 a.m. – 1 p.m., Emery Community Arts Center
Are you new to the music and visual artistry of David Bowie? Then this event is for you! Stephen Grandchamp, assistant professor of Literature and Digital Humanities at UMF, will screen and discuss four critical music videos from the career of David Bowie, including “Life on Mars?” in order to initiate the New Commons Project’s exploration of his life and art.
Keynote Event: “Mission: Imagination” with Martha Mooke
Oct. 7, 7-9 p.m., Emery Community Arts Center
Join a concert and discussion with electro-acoustic violist and David Bowie collaborator Martha Mooke. In this keynote event, she explores and interprets David Bowie’s “search for unconscious intelligence” inspired by his creative process of combining disassociated ideas to spark the creative muse.
The Man Who Fell to Earth. The New Commons Film Series: “Life on Mars?”
Oct. 14, 7-9:20 p.m., Emery Community Arts Center
The New Commons Film Series presents The Man Who Fell to Earth, the classic 1976 science fiction film starring David Bowie as alien Thomas Jerome Newton. Bowie was an artist of many talents, so be sure to attend this event to grapple with his amazing dramatic performance.
Join Shelton Waldrep’s lecture on David Bowie’s “Life on Mars?”
Oct. 25, 6-7:30 p.m., Emery Community Arts Center
Join Shelton Waldrep, distinguished professor of English at the University of Southern Maine, for an original exploration of David Bowie’s “Life on Mars?”, including its meaning and common misconceptions about it. Among many other works, Waldrep is the author of “Future Nostalgia: Performing David Bowie” (2015) and “The Aesthetics of Self-Invention: Oscar Wilde to David Bowie” (2004). Attendees will be included in a raffle to win a record featuring David Bowie’s greatest hits!
The UMF New Commons Project provides a rich offering of free events including expert talks, discussions, films, workshops and more, many online, for the education and enjoyment of people in Maine and beyond. Nominated by individuals throughout Maine, the selection of New Commons works have the common thread of representing many of the principles and cultural values that inspire and fascinate Maine residents.
The New Commons Project is a public humanities initiative of the University of Maine at Farmington, Maine’s public liberal arts college, in partnership with the Maine Humanities Council. It is made possible by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

NORWAY — Norway Memorial Library will host the Haunted Hall’s Paranormal Ghost Hunting Group on Thursday, October 21, 6:30-8 p.m. The group is made up of Yvonne Rose DePerte and Tyler Hall from Hiram, and Steve and Josh Hall from Sebago. They, along with Steve’s wife Sue and her son, Jack have investigated four different sites so far: The Old Mill in Vassalboro, Maine, The Admiral Peary Inn in Fryeburg, Maine, the USS Salem in Massachusetts, and the Shanley Hotel in Napanoch, NY. See coverage of these visits on The Haunted Hall’s Paranormal Facebook page and The Haunted Hall’s YouTube program. They look forward to investigating more sites in the future. The Haunted Hall’s will talk about what got them into ghost hunting, the equipment they use to investigate and record hauntings and spirits, and share some of their favorite experiences. They will share video clips from their investigations and will demonstrate their equipment. Q & A and sharing of ghost stories will follow. This program is an in-person program. Masks that fully cover nose and mouth are required regardless of vaccination status. Attendance is limited to 30 people to allow for social distancing.
Please call 743-5309 ext. 1, stop by the Information Desk, or e-mail norlib@norway.lib.me.us with questions.

Texto completo: PHILLIPS — All students at Phillips Elementary School have switched to remote instruction after an outbreak of COVID-19 and a significant number of close contacts, Superintendent Todd Sanders advised Thursday.
Students in grades kindergarten to eight are scheduled to return to in-person learning Tuesday, Oct. 12.
“The district has been in ongoing communication with the Maine Center for Disease Control regarding the current situation at Phillips Elementary School,” Sanders wrote in a letter posted Thursday on the School Administrative District 58 website. “As you are already aware PES has been identified as in “outbreak” status by the Maine Department of Education/MCDC.
“Since that identification, we have had more confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well as a significant number of new close contacts,” he wrote. “As a result of the impact of the confirmed cases and the close contact tracing that has identified additional students/staff that need to quarantine, we will need to move PES to remote learning” for the week Oct. 4-8.
Technology devices were sent home with students Thursday and lunches can be picked up for students from 9 to 11 a.m. Friday, according to Sanders’ letter.
Friday will be designated for educators to prepare for remote learning, which starts Monday, Sanders said. Friday, Oct. 8, is a scheduled workshop day and Monday, Oct. 11, is a holiday.
“We understand the additional challenges that making a decision such as this places on everyone involved,” Sanders wrote. “Please know it is not a decision we make lightly and it is something that we considered long and hard prior; however, the increased impact of COVID-19 made it necessary.
“At this point it is the best possible course of action to continue instruction as well as help to guarantee the safest possible learning environment for students and staff. Hopefully, following next week, the numbers of confirmed cases will have decreased to where we can return to providing instruction as we did at the start of the school year,” he said.
Phillips is not the only SAD 58 school with cases of the virus. Others have been reported this month at elementary schools in Strong and Kingfield and at Mt. Abram High School in Salem Township, according to Sanders.
The district has more than 600 students from Avon, Kingfield, Phillips and Strong, and nonresidents from Madrid, Salem and Freeman townships, and those from Eustis and Carrabassett Valley who pay tuition to attend SAD 58.

Retired journalist and genealogist Bob Greene is scheduled to give an online talk about “Black History of Maine” at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 7, hosted by Camden Public Library.
The free online program is part of the library’s month-long “Discover History” series.
It is frequently said that Maine is the whitest state in America, according to a library news release. Yet Black people have a long history in the Pine Tree State. Not just as slaves, but also as builders, farmers, fishermen, ship captains and educators.
The first Black lawyer in the United States passed the bar exam and practiced in Portland. Dr. Antonius Lamy, described in a 1672 court document as “Anthony, a Black man,” may have been Maine’s first doctor. It’s that hidden history of our state that Greene will reveal.
A native of Portland, Greene is the eighth generation of his family to be born in Cumberland County. His roots in Maine stretch back into the 1700s.
After graduating from Portland High, Greene went off to college and a career as a journalist. He has met three presidents: Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
As tennis writer for the Associated Press, Greene traveled the world covering the sport. After retiring, he returned to Maine where his genealogical research has led to his deep knowledge of Maine’s Black history. He teaches a Black History of Maine course at OLLI (Osher Lifelong Learning Institute) at the University of Southern Maine.
Greene is the 2021 recipient of the Maine Historical Society’s Neal Allen Award, which is presented each year for exceptional contributions to Maine History.
To learn more and register to attend, visit librarycamden.org. For more information, contact Julia Pierce at 207-230-4703 or jpierce@librarycamden.org.
Discover History Month at the Camden Public Library is sponsored by Camden Riverhouse Hotel & Inn, with additional support provided by The Smiling Cow.

AUBURN — The May 2019 fatal shooting of a man by police in Auburn during a standoff involving a hostage was justified, Maine’s attorney general said in a report released Wednesday.
Steven Case Jr., 29, of Bucksport, was shot and killed by a member of the Maine State Police’s Tactical Team after a five-hour stand-off at an Auburn apartment building.
Case barricaded himself in the basement at 185 Main St. after keeping police at bay for most of the day by threatening to shoot anybody who entered and telling police he had a hostage. The report states that Case was using the female hostage as a human shield.
According to the attorney general’s report, “At 2:46 p.m., the hostage was observed by Trooper Hardy to move away from Mr. Case just enough for Trooper Hardy to take a safe shot. Trooper Hardy fired a shot through a window and screen, incapacitating Mr. Case.”
The report states, “Trooper Hardy acted in defense of the hostage, himself, other officers and civilians within range of the firearms available to Mr. Case,” and only resorted to deadly force after negotiations failed and Case refused requests to release the hostage.
Following the incident, Hardy explained that he used deadly force “because of his concern that Mr. Case was going to use deadly force against the hostage,” and “was aware of Mr. Case’s escalating behavior, knew of his threats that something bad might happen, and had observed him controlling the hostage, using her to shield himself from view of law enforcement,” the report states.
On the morning of May 21, 2019, officers were advised by Auburn dispatch of a report of an unidentified man in the basement of the Main Street residence “with a large number of firearms and who was planning a shootout.”
The report states that when inspecting the basement, officers observed a large duffle bag that, upon being kicked, sounded as though it contained ammunition. Officers approached a makeshift wooden door separating the main portion of the basement from a smaller room, and as an officer pulled the door open, an unseen male (later determined to be Case) shouted, “Don’t come in here, I have a gun. Do not come in here.”
When officers identified themselves, Case again shouted for them not to enter, and the officers retreated up the basement stairs and took a position just outside the door to the basement. Additional officers from the Auburn Police Department were called to secure the building, and the Maine State Police Tactical Team was activated.
According to the report, from their position at the top of the stairs, officers heard Case, “shouting to not come down the stairs and that he had a hostage.” They also heard what sounded like guns being charged or “racked,” the report said.
Later in the morning, six members of the tactical team replaced the Auburn officers on the first floor of the house, taking a position at the top of the basement stairs. The state police Crisis Negotiation Team had also been in contact with Case by telephone.
Eventually, officers left the building, moving to the side of the garage, while Hardy and another trooper were directed to a position on the second floor of the adjacent apartment building, about 37 feet from 185 Main St.
According to the report, under Maine law, for any person, including a law enforcement officer, to be justified in using deadly force in self-defense or the defense of others, two requirements must be met. First, the person must reasonably and actually believe that unlawful deadly force is imminently threatened against the person or against someone else, and second, the person must reasonably and actually believe that deadly force is necessary to counter that imminent threat.
“Whether the use of force by a law enforcement officer is reasonable is based on the totality of the particular circumstances and judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, allowing for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a given situation,” the report states.

Legendary entertainer Frank Santos Jr. will present his R Rated Comedy Hypnosis act at 8 p.m. Friday, Oct. 8, on the first level of 49 Franklin in Rumford. This show is intended for mature audiences with a good sense of adult humor, and is part of the Best of Boston Entertainment Series.
Santos’ spectacular display of mind-bending antics can turn any skeptic into a fan. His act is always fresh, energetic and unique; no two shows are ever the same. The audience becomes the star. When Santos performs, you could be a bystander absorbing a comedy routine but, you, your friends, strangers across the room may be awaiting the possibility of instant stardom. With over 20 years of experience the comedian has the ability to read his audience and adjust his performance to please every appetite.
The limitless variations enable Santos to perform for anyone from curios and impressionable, to hip and rowdy college or night club crowds. He is sure to throw everyone into a frenzy of fun and cheers. Santos performs all across the country and is featured at many theatres throughout New England; The Palace Theatre, Colonial Theatre, Capital Center for the Arts, The Wilbur Theatre and many more.
Doors will open at 6 p.m.
Tickets cost $20 in advance at All That Jazz, on Congress Street, or online at 49franklin.com, or $25 at the door.

Texto completo: NORWAY — Western Maine has seen a burgeoning electric vehicle scene over the last seven years, with hundreds on the road and a growing EV charging network to serve the community. The annual National Drive Electric Week Solar & EV Expo hosted by the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy (CEBE) has played a big role in this transition, giving potential EV owners the opportunity to test drive a range of cars and learn directly from the people that drive them.
This year’s Expo will continue building excitement and educating locals through viewing, riding in, and test driving electric vehicles, riding eBikes, and attending workshops. Past Expos have included as many as 40 locally-owned electric vehicles and e-bikes and hundreds of test drives and rides. The event will run from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. on Oct. 2, as part of National Drive Electric Week.
It will include four interactive workshops: Electric Vehicle 101, Solar 101, the Future of EVs in Maine with Efficiency Maine Trust and the Natural Resources Council of Maine, and Community Solar Options. Introductory information on owning and operating an electric vehicle and on switching to solar power will be presented, as well as an update on CEBE’s Community Solar project and information about statewide efforts to support the transition to electric vehicles.
This event is free and will take place entirely outdoors in the parking lot of the Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School in South Paris. To protect the health of our community members, attendees are required to wear a mask and distance from those not in their family, regardless of vaccination status. In order to test-drive vehicles, individuals will also be required to be vaccinated.
“Maine has an ambitious goal of putting 219,000 EVs on the roads in Maine by 2030 and educational opportunities such as this one are critical to reaching these goals. We know that getting drivers behind the wheel of an EV is one of the best ways to encourage people to choose an EV as their next car. Efficiency Maine is glad to see CEBE and other community groups keeping the momentum behind EVs by providing hands-on experiences with these vehicles,” said Molly Siegel, Program Manager for EV Initiatives at Efficiency Maine Trust.
There are now more than 1.5 million EVs on the road in the United States, and a recent survey by Consumer Reports and the Union of Concerned Scientists showed that more than 60% of prospective car buyers in the U.S. are interested in electric vehicles. There are now more than 40 models available in the U.S., with many of the newer models having a range of 200-300 miles or more.
“Paris Autobarn has been a proud sponsor of the EV Expo for the last five years. Events like the Expo provide a wonderful opportunity for people to get a first-hand experience driving or riding in an electric car. Because of the EV Expo, Paris Autobarn has been able to put more EVs on the road and in the driveways of individuals who may have never even thought about owning an electric car,” said Tony Giambro of Paris Autobarn.
National Drive Electric Week is presented by national organizers Plug In America, the Electric Auto Association, the Sierra Club, and EVHybridNoire. Nissan LEAF® is the exclusive automotive sponsor of NDEW 2021 and Wells Fargo is the exclusive banking sponsor of NDEW 2021. ClipperCreek and Electrify America are silver-level sponsors. Edison International and Enel X are bronze-level sponsors. IBEW 11 is a green-level sponsor.
Additionally, Paris Autobarn, Efficiency Maine Trust, Lee Auto Malls, The Nature Conservancy, Natural Resources Council of Maine, ReVision Energy, and Garbo-Kane are local sponsors of the event. CEBE has also installed 15 EV chargers in the area to help encourage EV adoption as everyday transportation.
As in years past, this year’s event will include information on electric cars and eBikes, Maine’s current solar policy, how to get involved in CEBE’s Community Solar project, and the opportunity to interact with actual EV drivers and solar owners. Founded in 2013, the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy works to engage the community in addressing the climate emergency. They organize, educate, take direct action, and implement practical, ecological solutions for a just transition to a thriving, regenerative economy.

Texto completo: PHILLIPS — Five cases of COVID-19 in the eighth grade class at Phillips Elementary School has led to all eighth grade students learning remotely through Friday, Oct. 8.
A letter to the MSAD#58 community Thursday, Sept. 28, indicated additional confirmed cases bringing the total to five and putting the school in outbreak status.
“It has been determined the outbreak applies to one particular grade level at this time,” the letter states. “We will need to closely monitor to determine if there is any crossover to other grades within the building.”
The district has been in ongoing communication with the Maine Center for Disease Control (MCDC) and a Covid Outbreak Specialist, according to the letter.
With the outbreak continues to be in “monitoring” status, universal masking will remain in effect at the school, it notes.
“If we have additional confirmed cases or need to quarantine additional staff we might be forced to implement additional remote learning for additional grades or school-wide,” the letter continues.
On Sept. 22 a letter indicated one case had been confirmed at the Phillips and Strong elementary schools. A letter on Sept. 23 noted a case at Kingfield Elementary School. A letter on Sept. 27 informed of another case at the Phillips school.
Letters on Sept. 28 and 29 detailed a case at Strong elementary and Mt. Abram High School respectively.
Superintendent Todd Sanders and PES Principal Jeffrey Pillsbury could not be reached for more information.

BATH — The Kennebec Estuary Land Trust and the Ag Allies grassland bird conservation program are working together to protect Maine’s grassland birds, one field at a time.
“Given the conservation needs of our grassland birds, owners and managers of fields with even one or two nesting pairs can make a significant difference by preserving some habitat through the nesting season,” Ag Allies Program Manager Laura Lecker said in a news release from the land trust. “This new partnership between KELT and Ag Allies aims to help farmers do just that.”
Because of funding from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, next spring KELT and Ag Allies will be providing technical and financial support to farmers and landowners interested in protecting Bobolinks and other grassland birds. This collaboration will provide resources and guidance for preserving nesting habitat in hayed and grazed fields, improving soil and field quality, managing invasive species, and more. Those who own or manage property that supports grassland birds, or to learn more about Ag Allies, can contact Maeve McGowan at mmcgowan@kennebecestuary.org or Laura Leckey at laura.lecker@me.nacdnet.net. Updates are to come next spring.
For information about the land trust, visit kennebecestuary.org or call 207-442-8400. Ag Allies provides education and assistance to land owners and managers looking to make room for nesting habitat on our farming landscape.
Each summer, Maine’s hayfields are filled with the bubbly song of the Bobolink, a migratory grassland bird that nests on the ground of agricultural fields, according to the news release. These small blackbirds are remarkable for many reasons, including their unique plumage resembling a backwards tuxedo with a bright yellow cap, and their impressive migration of 12,500 miles each year.
But Bobolinks and other grassland species are in grave danger primarily due to habitat loss and intensified agriculture.
Since 1966, Bobolinks have faced a cumulative decline of 65%. To stabilize and ultimately reverse this trend, protecting Bobolinks and their habitat during breeding season is particularly important.
Because grassland birds nest in active agricultural fields, they depend on farming and the habitat it creates. However, disruption by farming equipment, grazing livestock, or humans during the breeding season results in nests being destroyed, contributing to population decline. While managing hayfields for both commercial harvesting and for grassland bird conservation appears to be complex, it can be both practical and productive, benefitting birds and farmers alike.

LISBON — Running is the easy part of training for Kim Young.
“It’s me time,” she said. “I think a lot while running. I think about a lot of ‘what ifs.’ I think about how incredibly fortunate I am. I think about it constantly.”
“It” is cancer, specifically epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, or EHE.
“It gets heavy,” Young said of her running thoughts.
On Sunday, she’ll run the 26.2-mile Maine Marathon in Portland. Her 4-year-old son, Owen, and her husband, Greg, along with her parents and in-laws will be there to cheer her on.
“This marathon is a huge deal to her,” her mother, Sue Bechard, said.
In February, Young had a sharp pain in her abdomen and two weeks later she was told she had EHE, which strikes one in a million people.
“I like being told I am one in a million, but that is not how I wanted that to be,” she said.
“I can’t even describe the feeling,” she said about the phone conversation with her doctor that evening. The first words she could think to say were, “But I’m not sick. I feel fine.”
“It did not sink in at first. It hit me later that night and I had a bit of a breakdown,” she said.
There is no treatment for EHE.
“The wait-and-see approach is how we are taking it,” Young said. “There is no tried and true way to treat this. It’s very unpredictable. I may live for 30-40 years and never know I have cancer or it can become aggressive and I start treatment,” she said.

Young has run a half marathon and had always wanted to run a full one. Once diagnosed with cancer, a marathon took on a whole new meaning.
“It was an ah-ha moment,” she said.
Training has been “grueling,” she said. “Carving out time to run is brutal.”
Young tries to get one in before her son gets up in the morning. “But, Owen is an early riser. He gets up five minutes after I do,” she said.
“Staying consistent is the tough part” about training, but she said she’s ready.
She is running to inform others about the rare cancer she is living with.
“I have taken it upon myself to raise awareness because everyone is like, what is that? The word itself sounds like I made it up,” she said.
She designed a shirt with the words “Just Live,” a motto with special meaning to those with EHE. On the back are the names of survivors or people who have died from the disease.
“Those names are going to carry me across the finish line,” she said.
So far, Young has raised over $1,200 for the EHE Foundation from sales of the shirts.

Texto completo: NEWRY — The Androscoggin River Watershed Council plans to host the 26th Annual Androscoggin River Watershed Conference from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 5, at the Grand Summit Hotel at Sunday River Resort, at 15 S. Ridge Road, in Newry.
The conference will feature a variety of topics of interest to residents, businesses, and government leaders. An open discussion on the Future of the Androscoggin River and its Watershed will follow breakout morning sessions and lunch.
As has been publicized during the pandemic, human connections with nature benefit both physical and mental health. The health-nature session will explore this topic in more detail. Alicia Heyburn from Teens to Trails will be joined by Rebecca Boulos, executive director of the Maine Public Health, and Corie Washow of Elemental Counseling.
The impact of climate change on rivers and streams will be another session topic. Severe climate fluctuations are becoming both more frequent and more localized. While some areas of Maine have experienced normal rainfall, others are experiencing severe drought. This is true within the Androscoggin Watershed. Flooding has washed out roads and damaged fish spawning habitat, and the enjoyment of boating and fishing has been impacted by droughts. The lack of rainfall and rising temperatures have also adversely affected wildlife and fisheries.
What happens on land reflects directly in our ground and surface waters. The session will look at how good forest stewardship impacts aquatic habitat, especially brook trout. Improving in-stream brook trout habitat has been a major focus of the Watershed Council for more than a decade. Their habitat is threatened by changing land uses and the warming of surface waters.
Jeff Reardon from Maine Trout Unlimited and Charles Gauvin, former long-time CEO of national Trout Unlimited will provide their expertise on the impacts of watershed forestry and conservation on aquatic habitat. In another session, Mark Brockmann will discuss the geology, rocks, minerals, and Native American artifacts of Western Maine.
A wide-ranging discussion on the future of the river and watershed is expected with topics encompassing water quality classification, under and overuse and conflicting uses, public access, climate change and increasing water temperatures, dams and fish passage, and shoreline development. A vigorous discussion is expected following a brief presentation by several speakers giving their own take on the issues. Masks will be required and CDC COVID protocols will be followed. There will be adequate space to properly distance for sessions and for eating.

Texto completo: BASKETBALL
The NBA has seen a rise in vaccination rates in recent days when factoring in those players who have received at least one of the necessary shots, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said Thursday.
The leaguewide rate is now around 95% when counting those who are at least in the vaccination process, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the NBA nor the National Basketball Players Association released the figure publicly.
Based on a rough count of nearly 600 players in the league right now for training camps – that figure will be closer to 500 when the regular season begins Oct. 19 and rosters get trimmed – the 95% figure would suggest that, on average, one player per team is unvaccinated.
ESPN first reported the 95% figure. Earlier in the week, AP reported that the leaguewide rate entering the week was 90% and climbing.
The NBA gave teams tentative health and safety protocols for the season Tuesday, detailing how players who haven’t gotten the COVID-19 vaccination will be tested far more often than their vaccinated colleagues and face a slew of other restrictions.
WNBA: Alyssa Thomas and DeWanna Bonner each scored 15 points and the Connecticut Sun beat the visiting Chicago Sky 79-68 to even the best-of-five semifinals at a win apiece.
The Sun won despite WNBA MVP Jonquel Jones scoring just four points.
COLLEGES
FIELD HOCKEY: Hannah Wurdack scored three goals, and Faith Jennings and Beth Koeller added two apiece as Bowdoin (6-2) cruised to a 10-0 win over Southern Maine (5-5) in Brunswick.
Jill Cloonan, Sophia Rosati and Caroline Higgins also scored.
WOMEN’S SOCCER: Cricket Basa’s unassisted goal 10:32 into the contest started Vermont (4-5-1, 1-1 America East) on its way to a 2-0 win over Maine (2-4-2, 0-3) in Orono.
Alyssa Oviedo made it 2-0 in the second half.
GOLF
PGA: Rookie Sahith Theegala carved his tee shots into play and made it look easy from there for an 8-under 64 and an early one-shot lead over Nick Watney and Harold Varner III in the Sanderson Farms Championship at Jackson, Mississippi.
Defending champion Sergio Garcia, the only player from the Ryder Cup last week in the field, had two birdies in a bogey-free round of 70 that left him six shots behind.
EUROPEAN TOUR: Tyrrell Hatton quickly shook off the disappointment of Europe’s heavy loss at the Ryder Cup last week, grabbing a share of the first-round lead in St. Andrews, Scotland, at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, an event he has won twice.
Playing traditionally the toughest of the three courses that stage the tournament, Hatton shot an 8-under 64 at Carnoustie to tie for the lead with Nicolas Colsaerts, Adri Arnaus (both St. Andrews) and Li Haotong (Kingsbarns).
Each player in the 168-man field plays a round at all three venues, before the final round takes place at St. Andrews.
TENNIS
SAN DIEGO OPEN: Denis Shapovalov erased a big deficit and six set points in the opener en route to a 7-6 (7), 6-2 victory over Taylor Fritz to reach his first quarterfinal since Wimbledon.
CHICAGO CLASSIC: Ons Jabeur overcame a slow start to beat Jessica Pegula 1-6, 6-2, 6-3 and advance to face No. 1 seed Elina Svitolina, who defeated Elena-Gabriela Ruse, 6-3, 6-3.
Other seeded women who reached the quarterfinals included No. 2 Garbine Muguruza, No. 3 Belinda Bencic, No. 5 Elena Rybakina and No. 10 Danielle Collins.
BOXING
OLYMPICS: Boxing bouts at the 2016 Olympics were fixed by “complicit and compliant” referees and judges, an investigation reported.
Investigator Richard McLaren was appointed by the International Boxing Association, known as AIBA, and found AIBA officials selected referees and judges to ensure that bouts could be manipulated in Olympic qualifying and at the Rio de Janeiro Games. He also found signs the 2012 Olympics in London were affected.
“Key personnel decided that the rules did not apply to them,” said McLaren, who added there was a “culture of fear, intimidation and obedience in the ranks of the referees and judges.”

FARMINGTON — Franklin Memorial Hospital (FMH) recently received its US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care 2020 (mPINC) Hospital Report that demonstrated FMH’s commitment to quality improvement in maternity practices that support optimal infant nutrition.
As one of 2,103 U.S. hospitals that responded to the survey, Franklin Memorial Hospital received an overall score of 96 out of 100. The overall average score for all hospitals in the United States is 81, in the northeast 85, and for similarly-sized hospitals 77.
Subscores further categorize maternity care practices such as: immediate postpartum care, rooming-in, feeding practices, feeding education and support, and discharge support. FMH received perfect 100 subscores in 18 of the 22 measures.
The US CDC invites all hospitals across the country to complete the mPINC survey to assess maternity care practices. CDC calculates a total mPINC score for every participating hospital to indicate its overall level of maternity care practices and policies that support optimal infant feeding.
Responses are scored using an algorithm that denotes the evidence and best practices to promote optimal infant feeding within the maternity care setting. Scores range from zero to 100, with higher scores indicating better maternity care practices and policies. CDC provides this report to highlight strengths and quality improvement opportunities, and to illustrate how hospital practices compare with others of similar size, across the region, and nationwide.
“It is nice to see this level of national recognition highlighting what most of us are already aware of—we have an outstanding maternity care team including our dedicated obstetricians/gynecologists, nurse midwife, pediatricians, unit nurses and staff, and staff in our women’s care and pediatrics’ practices,” said Dr. Ross Isacke, FMH chief medical officer. “It is great to know that we are meeting the health care needs for expecting families in our community.”
In March, FMH was additionally named to Newsweek’s 2021 list of Best Maternity Care Hospitals. That distinction recognized facilities that have provided exceptional care to mothers, newborns and their families, as verified by the 2020 Leapfrog Hospital Survey.

Texto completo: HIRAM — Telstar came out firing to start the game and the defense shut out Sacopee Valley 34-0 in an eight-man Small School South division football game Thursday night.
Rebels (5-0) quarterback Will Doyle threw five touchdowns passes, including two in the first quarter — an 11-yard pass to Gavinn Martin and a 28-yarder to Wyatt Lilly. Overall, Lilly caught three touchdowns.
Telstar head coach Tim O’Connor wanted the Rebels to get off to a fast start after they only scored six points in the first half against Maranacook in Week 4.
“We worked on all of those things this week, had good week of practice and we played so much better tonight,” O’Connor said. “Incredibly better. The line played a lot better, we ran the ball well and we passed a lot. I think Will was feeling it tonight, and our receivers, we worked on routes all week making sure we ran the right routes and the kids were doing a great job. (Sacopee Valley’s defenders) couldn’t cover them.”
In the second quarter Thursday, Lilly caught an 11-yard touchdown pass to put Telstar up 20-0 heading into halftime.
The Rebels’ defense was strong throughout the game, creating turnovers and negative-yardage plays for the Hawks (1-4).
“The defense was staunch,” O’Connor said. “We had numerous sacks and had a fumble recovery from Cruise Kimball and an interception by Brayden Stevens.”
In the third quarter, Doyle threw two more touchdowns. One was a 47-yarder to Cameron Palmer and the other was a 25-yard pass to Lilly.
TWO GAMES NIXED
Friday’s game between Lisbon at Winthrop/Monmouth/Hall-Dale and Saturday’s Poland at Freeport games were called off Thursday afternoon.
Winthrop Athletic Director Joel Stoneton announced the cancellation of the Ramblers’ game on social media Thursday. In his posts, Stoneton said he found out Thursday morning that there are COVID-19 issues on Lisbon’s team. He added that he was searching for a new opponent for Winthrop/Monmouth/Hall-Dale to play this week.
This is the second time this season that Lisbon has had a game canceled due to COVID. The Greyhounds’ scheduled Week 2 matchup against Madison/Carrabec/Valley was canceled because of COVID within the Bulldogs’ program.
Later Thursday, the Knights game against the Falcons was canceled, according to Poland Athletic Director Don King. It was later revealed that due to COVID and injuries, Freeport does not have enough players.
This will be the third week this season that Poland has been affected by COVID. It’s Week 2 matchup against Bucksport was canceled, then its Week 3 game against Madison/Carrabec/Valley was also axed — though the Knights were able to scramble and schedule a game against Belfast.
King told the Sun Journal that he will try to find a creative solution to find the Knights a Week 5 game.
Winthrop/Monmouth/Hall-Dale played last week, and the Ramblers won 40-6.

Auburn Mall vaccine clinic to offer booster shots for eligible individuals

AUBURN — Eligible individuals can get their booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic at the Auburn Mall as early as Friday, Central Maine Healthcare announced Thursday.
Booster shots are available only for those who received the Pfizer vaccine at least six months ago and only for certain groups of people. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunizations recommended that certain groups of people should get a booster dose. They are:
• All individuals 65 years and older
• Individuals 18 years or older in long-term care facilities
• Individuals 50-64 years with underlying medical conditions
Additionally, the U.S. CDC said individuals ages 18-49 with underlying medical conditions or at increased risk of exposure to COVID due to their “occupational or institutional” settings are also eligible to receive a booster dose but placed an emphasis on the latter groups to get their third shots.
“Our site is able to easily scale up and down to meet changing demand and has done so for nearly seven months,” CMH’s vice president and chief operating officer, Amy Lee, said in a statement. CMH is the parent organization to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.
The Auburn Mall clinic is accepting eligible individuals regardless of where they received their primary vaccination series (first and second dose) of the Pfizer vaccine. Walk-ins are only accepted for those who received their shots at a CMH location, including at the Auburn Mall clinic, Central Maine Medical Center, Rumford Hospital and Bridgton Hospital.
To make an appointment, visit cmhc.org/get-covid-vaccine or call the COVID-19 Vaccine Call Center at 520-2917. The clinic is open Tuesday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Studies cited by the U.S. CDC of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations show that they remain remarkably effective in preventing infection and severe illness, but that effectiveness of the vaccine lessens over time after the second dose. Booster shots are intended to bolster protection and are the same vaccine and dosage as the initial inoculation series.
Separate from booster shots, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and CDC in August approved additional doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, specifically those who have received an organ transplant or have other conditions that put them at increased risk.
Nearly 1,500 residents of the tri-county region of Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford had received a booster shot by Thursday, according to the Maine CDC. About 19,500 people statewide have gotten a booster dose.
The high-volume clinic at the Auburn Mall continues to offer the primary vaccine series of the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots, as well as the booster doses and additional doses for immunocompromised people.
Meanwhile, state health officials reported 925 new cases of COVID-19 in Maine on Thursday, including 49 in Androscoggin County, 22 in Franklin County and 56 in Oxford County.
As of Thursday, Franklin and Oxford counties’ seven-day rolling average of new daily cases per capita, which stood at 5.35 cases and 5.83 cases, respectively, per 10,000 residents, was higher than the average in Androscoggin County and statewide.
In Androscoggin County, there were 4.01 new cases per 10,000 residents per day over the seven-day period ending Thursday. Statewide, that number was 4.39 new cases per 10,000 residents.
Epidemiologists use a rolling average of new cases to smooth out daily blips and dips in case counts and to determine how quickly the virus is spreading in a community and which areas are hotspots.
A Flourish chart
There were no additional deaths due to COVID.
“There are some signs of optimism on the horizon. But there’s still a lot of signs for concern,” Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah said at a briefing Wednesday.
“There are some very early, way-too-preliminary, unclear signs that there might be an easing,” he said. “But I’m not taking that to the bank yet.”
The daily count of individuals hospitalized with COVID has been greater than 200 people for about two weeks. As of Thursday, 225 individuals were hospitalized in Maine, including 77 of whom were in critical care and 36 of whom were on ventilators.
Providers at CMMC cared for an average of 11 patients per day over the week ending Wednesday, according to hospital data. There were 12 COVID inpatients there as of Wednesday, two of whom were in the intensive care unit. There were no patients on ventilators.

Question 1: the CMP corridor

Texto completo: To the Editor:
First CMP tried to distance their abysmal reputation from the CMP corridor project, designed to deliver power to Massachusetts through the heart of western Maine. Many saw through this ploy and, despite being subjected to a $30 million PR campaign, Mainers remained unconvinced that it’s a good deal. Now, just weeks before Election Day, CMP has again shifted tactics. Now, they don’t mention the project at all. CMP has propped up new organizations and hired new spokespeople to spread fear and misinformation about Question 1. My hope is that Mainers again see through CMP’s nonsense.
Question 1 does NOT:
• Create retroactivity – this already exists in statute
• Put roads, bridges, or your back deck at risk
Question 1 does:
• Affirm the Legislature and the court’s finding that the lease to cross public lands cannot be hashed out behind closed doors
• Protect critical wildlife habitat in the Upper Kennebec region from high impact transmission lines
• Require a simple majority vote for high impact transmission lines that are greater than 50 miles in length
For those of you who are still on the fence, know this – Question 1 is your opportunity to stop the CMP Corridor, uphold the Maine Constitution and inject much-needed transparency into the approval process for similar projects down the road. Question 1 is necessary to prevent unelected bureaucrats from pushing unpopular projects that put the interests of foreign corporations first. If we don’t act now, Maine will become nothing more than an extension cord for southern New England, or as my good friend Darryl says, a cold New Jersey. Please vote YES Question 1 to ban the CMP Corridor on November 2.

Texto completo: TURNER — Maddie Morin scored four goals, including two in the third quarter, to pace Leavitt past Maranacook 9-0 in KVAC field hockey action Thursday.
“Maddie has really been making huge improvements this year. As a freshman she has been really aggressive especially in the circle,” Leavitt coach Wanda Ward-MacLean said. “She usually comes off the bench but with others players out with quarantining she has certainly made the most of the opportunity.”
Ava Gagnon added two goals, Cierra Barker had a goal and an assist and Kaylee Bellmore and Katie Sirois also scored for the Hornets (7-1). Anna Sargent notched two assists and Daisy Twitchell and Izzy Gates each had helpers in the fourth quarter, when Leavitt scored its final three goals.
“It was nice to see us be aggressive in the third period,” Ward-MacLean said. “The girls are really working hard this year to play a full game and not let up in the second half.”
Esme Jamison made 14 saves for Maranacook, while Paige DeMascio and Bella Westman split time in the Leavitt goal without facing a shot on target.
“Defensively, we have a lot of senior leadership,” Ward-MacLean said. “Paige DeMascio in goal, Daisy Twitchell, Cara Jordan, Megan Nason, Cadence McDowell have all done a great job shutting down opposing offenses.”
BREWER 1, EDWARD LITTLE 0: Laura Stewart scored the game’s lone goal in the second quarter as the Witches (3-5) edged the Red Eddies (1-9) in Auburn.
Emma Look stopped nine shots for Brewer. Kasey Smith made three saves for Edward Little, which outshot the Witches 10-5.
LEWISTON 2, OXFORD HILLS 1, OT: Lexi Freeman scored from Kelsey Westleigh in overtime to lift the Blue Devils (5-4-1) past the Vikings (7-4) in Lewiston.
Ahna Dostie opened the scoring for Lewiston in the second quarter, with Ceci Miller and Katie Laslie providing assists. Ashlee Farrar tied it for Oxford Hills in the fourth quarter.
Kim McLaughlin made six saves in the win, while Gabby Wright stopped eight shots for the Vikings.
BOYS SOCCER
LISBON 8, CARRABEC 0: The Greyhounds (8-1) scored half a dozen goals in the first half to put away the Cobras early in North Anson.
Danny Levesque, Hunter Brissette and Bryce Poulin of Lisbon all scored two goals each, while Elijah Fullerton, Sam Labamba and Aiden Parker all added a goal each of their own. Sean Moore saved two shots for Lisbon.
WINTHROP 1, MOUNTAIN VALLEY 0: The Ramblers (3-5) shut out the Falcons (0-5) in Winthrop.
Tyler Shumway scored the lone goal for Winthrop off an assist from Iker Penniman, while freshman goalkeeper Jaxon August saved five shots without allowing a goal.
Mountain Valley’s Zack New saved eight shots.
LEAVITT 1, ERSKINE ACADEMY 1: Liam Perfetto scored a goal for the Eagles, who tied the Hornets in South China.
Timber Parlin had four saves for Erskine (4-0-1).
Cooper McGray had a goal for Leavitt (2-1-2).
GIRLS SOCCER
OAK HILL 9, CARRABEC 0: The Raiders (4-0) blew out the Cobras (1-1) on Thursday in Wales.
Gabby Chessie scored a hat trick for Oak Hill as part of her team’s nine-goal performance. Six other players scored goals for Oak Hill, while Paige Gonya and Eliana Smith both spent time in net, combining for zero goals.
Carrabec’s Trinity Slate saved 25 shots.
LEAVITT 1, ERSKINE ACADEMY 0: The Hornets (2-5-1) took down the Eagles (3-2-1) in the second half in Turner.
Logan Arsenault redirected a corner kick with just-over 18 minutes to play in regulation to score and give Leavitt the 1-0 victory. Jalee Boucher was credited with the assist. Leavitt’s Carlie Leavitt saved 13 shots.
Erskine’s Sophia Pilotte saved 10 shots.
MT. BLUE 4, SKOWHEGAN 1: Vivian Cormier scored two goals and the Cougars (6-1-1) had assists from four different players in a KVAC win over the visiting River Hawks (0-6-2) in Farmington.
Kaylee Sterling and Hannah Wilbur also scored for Mt. Blue, while Eryn Parlin, Emma Dunn, Callahan Towle and Grace Bell all notched assists.
WAYNFLETE 5, ST. DOMINIC 1: Lucy Hart scored a hat trick as the Flyers (3-4) cruised past the Saints (1-6) in Auburn.
Izzy Gleason chipped in with a goal and an assist. Cece Marshall also scored.
Isabella Webster scored for St Dom’s. Anna Theriault made nine saves in the effort.
YARMOUTH 3, GRAY-NEW GLOUCESTER 0: Grace Lestage scored on a Macy Gilroy feed early in the second half to break a scoreless tie as the Clippers (7-1-1) blanked the Patriots (2-6) at Gray.
Yarmouth got a goal from Trinity Sinker as well as an unassisted goal from Lestage.
Isa Ross (11 saves) and Abby Joyce (three) split time in the Gray-NG net. Regan Sullivan stopped for saves for the shutout.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Many of us alive today are the lucky recipients of miraculous vaccinations discovered many years ago and have eradicated deadly diseases such as smallpox, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, and tetanus. These vaccinations were mandated and required for all children to attend public schools. Many thousands of people died or were disabled for life from these diseases but how many do we know of that were harmed by the vaccines?
Now we have a chance to end another deadly disease with another miraculous vaccine. It is hard to understand why we do not collectively choose to do so.
Perhaps our next vaccine will make us immune to disinformation!

LITCHFIELD – Elaine L. Braunfels, a lifelong resident of Litchfield, died Monday, Sept. 27, 2021 after a courageous 18-year battle with Parkinson’s Disease.
Elaine was born on Sept. 18, 1947. She was one of 13 children born to Roger and Jeanette Turcotte.
Elaine attended Litchfield Academy and graduated from Monmouth Academy. Not a traditional student, Elaine started her first year of college when she was 38. While both working and raising a family, Elaine earned a Bachelor of Science in Art Education from the University of Southern Maine where she received high honors.
In January of 1970, Elaine walked into the Chuck Wagon restaurant in Brunswick where she met the love of her life and her best friend, Richard and they were married for 50 years.
Elaine worked many different jobs prior to her teaching career. She started at Woolworths at the age of 16 and later worked at Pioneer Plastics, Depositors Trust Bank, and Johnson Associates in Auburn, garnering the affection of her coworkers every place she worked. Elaine shared her passion for art when she took a job in the RSU #4 school system where she touched hundreds of lives teaching K-8 art for 17 years.
Elaine loved an adventure. She always jumped in the ocean, and swam out further than anybody should, no matter how frigid the water. Her quest for sand dollars was a tribute to her mother, and she acquired a massive collection. Elaine climbed and painted almost every inch of coastline in Maine. She was especially fond of Pemaquid Point as showcased in her watercolor paintings.
Elaine’s true joy in life came from her grandchildren. She often joked with her daughter’s saying, “I wish I could have skipped you girls and gone straight to the grandkids.” The grandkids enjoyed their adventures with Gram both in Maine and at Gram and Grump’s winter home in Venice, Fla.
Elaine enjoyed playing card games and poker, painting and sculpting, reading for hours at a time, riding her bike, and above all else, shopping at TJ Maxx.
Elaine will always be remembered for only knowing the first three lines of every song, breaking into song at a second’s notice, her perfect apple pies, and her favorite saying, “This is a day for making daydreams.”
She was predeceased by her brothers Robert, and Micheal; and her parents Roger and Jeannette Turcotte.
She is survived by her husband, Richard; her daughters Kate Reagan and husband Michael, Jennifer Braunfels and husband Richard Wardwell; four grandchildren, Alex, James, Maxim, and MacKenzee; her two surrogate children, Jeannette and Jimmy Schram; sister, Jackie Barrett, brother Bert Turcotte and his wife Pat, sister, Alice McPeake and husband Mac McPeake, sister, Judy Schram and husband Bud, sister, Susie Poppish and husband Dave, sister, Janie Connors, sister, Denise Sweet and husband Gary, brother, Tom Turcotte and wife Pam, Roger Jr. Turcotte and his wife Becky, and the baby of the family, Peggy Veroneau and husband Steve. She is also survived by many nieces and nephews; as well as great-nieces and nephews; and great-great-nieces and nephews.
Memories and condolences may be shared at http://www.lynchbrothers.com.
If you’d like to offer condolences, please join the family at the American Legion Post 181 at 235 Plains Rd. in Litchfield on Sunday Oct. 3 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation in
her honor.

Texto completo: Mientras que para el ingreso a Estados Unidos desde cualquier destino internacional se requiere obligatoriamente presentar una prueba COVID-19 negativa , para la mayoría de los viajes domésticos se han retirado las medidas de seguridad, aunque algunas entidades y ciudades mantienen ciertos requisitos.
Requisitos COVID-19 para viajes internacionales hacia Estados Unidos
Desde el 26 de enero de 2021, los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) requieren que todos los pasajeros aéreos de dos años de edad en adelante que ingresen a los Estados Unidos presenten una prueba COVID-19 negativa .

Los pasajeros cuyos documentos estén en un idioma diferente al inglés deberán consultar con su aerolínea antes de viajar.
Las aerolíneas deben confirmar el resultado negativo de la prueba o la prueba de recuperación reciente de todos los pasajeros antes de abordar el avión y negar el abordaje a quienes no presenten esta documentación.

Texto completo: A man who received almost $17,000 in fraudulently obtained CARES Act unemployment funds was sentenced on Sept. 20, 2021, to five months in federal prison. Larry Neal Wells, age 63, from Center Point, received the prison term after an April 5, 2021 guilty plea to one count of wire fraud.
Information from sentencing and a plea agreement showed that Wells received $16,978 in unemployment funds to which he was not entitled from the states of Maine and New York. Wells withdrew the funds in cash, kept some of the funds for himself, and mailed the rest to other individuals.
Wells was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Judge C.J. Williams. Wells was sentenced to five months' imprisonment. He was ordered to make $7,728 in restitution to the New York State Department of Labor and $9,250 in restitution to the Maine Department of Labor. He must also serve a five-year term of supervised release after the prison term. There is no parole in the federal system. Wells was released on the bond previously set and is to surrender to the United States Marshal on Oct. 4, 2021.
This prosecution is an example of the Department of Justice's commitment to combating fraud and criminal activity related to COVID-19. Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Department of Justice's National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Kyndra Lundquist and investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Labor Office of Inspector General. Court file information at https://ecf.iand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl. The case file number is 20-CR-113.

Texto completo: Snap shots
In March 2020, as the world started shutting down, three photographers — Robin Fader in Washington, D.C., Victor Mirontschuk in New York, and Susan Baggett in Boston — set out to capture how the pandemic was altering life in the urban landscape. Their project soon expanded to encompass racial justice protests and the presidential election. The resulting book of photographs, “2020 Unmasked” (Lightning), captures the tumult and intensity of one singular year. Their images show blocks-long lines for COVID tests, empty train stations, squares, movie theaters. Graffiti and protest signs announce the divided atmosphere. Cops in riot gear, nurses in plastic face shields, a sign on the side of a Boston building that reads, simply, “STOP KILLING BLACK PEOPLE.” There's fear in the eyes of a Black toddler wearing a mask held in someone's arms at a protest. A woman in the back of a pick-up points her finger, hollering, her face mangled in anger. The photographers capture the fear, fury, frenzy, and energy of a year defined by death and isolation, by unrest and fervent calls for reform, and by people trying to find calm and hope and glimmers of joy when they could. Kids shoot hoops, swing on monkey bars, a just-married couple smooches on Boston Common. It's a powerful document of time like no other time.
Ghostly tales
October now, and so begins the haunted season of the year. A new anthology of ghost stories, edited by Midcoast Maine writer and editor Paul Guernsey, and including a selection of stories by authors from all over the world, traffics in the uncanny, the strange, the inexplicable. “21st Century Ghost Stories: Volume II” (Wyrd Harvest) is striking for its variety of approaches to the supernatural. “Corpse Walks into a Bar” by Somerville-based author and Halloween scholar Lesley Bannatyne hints at the grateful dead folktale motif, and is set in Dorchester; it mixes a distinctly Boston humor and atmosphere with the haunting questions of what we could've done differently. In “The Mission Bell,” Maine author and musician Lara Tupper offers Lynchian surreality in her twist-up of the Eagles' “Hotel California. “Fairies, vampires, demons, The Devil Himself, snakes . . . mystery animals, ancient curses, contemporary curses . . . and a number of haunted objects, including . . . a stuffed rabbit with a bad attitude” make up these stories, as Guernsey writes. The collection is strange and smart and upends ideas of what a ghost story is, and expands, with verve and unsettling bizarrity, what it can be.
Gardner for the littles
A lively new picture book tells the story of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. “What Isabella Wanted” by Candace Fleming and illustrated by Matthew Cordell (Neal Porter) depicts a “brash, extravagant” Gardner, strolling up Beacon Street with lions, wearing baseball gear to the symphony, and traveling abroad to acquire art and arranging it just so, collecting more, “so much more, always more, exactly as Isabella wanted.” She opened her museum home in 1903, each item, each piece of art, each object placed exactly, unchanged and untouched. That changes when thieves steal in and tuck paintings away, their empty frames evidence that the crime has not been solved. The book opens a window into a big and bright personality, revealing the history of beloved Boston institution.
Coming Out
“ The Swank Hotel ” by Lucy Corin (Graywolf)
“ Search History ” by Eugene Lim (Coffee House)
“ Shelf Life: Chronicles of a Cairo Bookseller ” by Nadia Wassef (FSG)
Pick of the Week
Geri Zeller at Island Books in Middletown, R.I., recommends “Transcendent Kingdom” by Yaa Gyasi (Knopf): “This is the powerful portrait of Ghanaian immigrants, a beautiful story of a brilliant young woman, who through her graduate study on mice in her lab, tries to understand depression and addiction as it ravages her beloved mother and talented brother. This is my over-simplification of a story of faith, science, grief, depression, addiction and, most of all, love.”

Texto completo: "I dreamed of being a PI as a kid," private investigator Joshua Gray told me over the phone. Now he is living the dream.
At 44, Gray is a licensed investigator in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Tennessee.
He has built a business that investigates workers’ compensation claims, as well as disability and other insurance fraud. Some 90% of his work involves surveillance, he said.
In 2018, however, when Gray applied for a PI license in Maine, where he grew up, Maine state police turned him down because his social-media criticism of a 2017 police shooting that left two Maine residents dead demonstrated he lacked "good moral character."
Gray is suing Maine with the help of the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice.
"The government can’t deny you an occupational license because they think that your political speech is ill-conceived," Institute for Justice senior attorney Paul Sherman explained. The Maine Supreme Court ruled against his client, who is taking the suit all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In the age of social media, this sort of incident is likely to come up again.
Occupational licensing boards, Sherman warned, "routinely act as if the First Amendment doesn’t apply to them."
About one in five working Americans needs a license to make a living, the Institute for Justice estimates.
So, pay attention.
If your views conflict with the powers that be where you live, authorities could yank your ability to make a living.
Gray definitely got some details wrong as he opined on Facebook about the Feb. 10, 2017, shooting that left Amber Fagre, 18, and Kadhar Bailey, 25, dead.
Gray exhibited a photo of the car in which Fagre and Bailey were shot. It showed, he wrote, "a possible drunk, off duty and corrupt (officer) murdered Amber Fagre."
Wrong. The officer Gray named did not shoot Fagre — another officer did — but he did shoot Bailey, who apparently had just committed an armed burglary.
When a Maine attorney general report identified the police shooters, Gray corrected himself online.
Ultimately, the Maine attorney general ruled that officers acted in self-defense.
Gray argues that opining on a police shooting as it was "unfolding and developing" is bound to be fluid, so his correcting the record cleans the slate. He also differentiated between his comments on the shooting, which did not involve his PI work, and his more thorough work product.
There’s no defending some of Gray’s smears.
The police officer denied in an affidavit not only that he had been drinking that day but also that he ever has drunk alcohol in his life.
"So I posted to social media that (he) was off duty and possibly drinking. Many cops start drinking after a long shift," Gray wrote, before adding an ethnic smear in what ostensively was his defense.
Gray since has maintained that the failure of authorities to conduct an alcohol test after the shooting itself is suspect.
"Once you find holes in a report, you tend to disbelieve the entire report," he offered, apparently unaware of how that standard might reflect on him.
But then, free speech is messy. That’s why you don’t want to give government officials license to decide that people who criticize them can’t work in their chosen profession.
If Maine can say no to Gray because he criticized a police shooting or they didn’t like the way he criticized it, and the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the Maine ruling, authorities elsewhere will see the end product as a green light to slam the door on their critics.
Health care workers, hair stylists and cabdrivers could find themselves unable to work if they publicly disagree with the actions or pronouncements of state officials.
I disagree with most of what Gray wrote, but I defend his right to express his viewpoint.

Texto completo: * Byron DeLeon was promoted to head coach of the Saint Viator girls varsity soccer team.
This past summer, DeLeon was also promoted to the position of head coach of the boys varsity soccer team after serving as the head coach of the boys JV soccer team, as well as assistant coach of the boys varsity soccer team.
DeLeon has previously coached for Saint Patrick High School, Notre Dame High School for Girls, Mustangs FC, Lyons SC, Maine East High School, and has 16 years of experience as the head coach of the International Tribe Soccer Club Boys U18 team.
"I’ve been coaching soccer for 20 years and I’m grateful to be so deeply integrated into the Saint Viator soccer program," DeLeon said. "My goal is not just to help shape these young men and women into skilled athletes, but to help them build character and gain confidence on the field and in the classroom."
DeLeon will take over as head coach of the girls varsity soccer team in the spring.
* Corey Olson, head football coach at Palatine High School, was named the Chicago Bears High School "Coach of the Week" for Week Four.
The Bears will make a $2,000 donation to the Palatine High School football program in his honor.
Recently, Olson’s Pirates overcame a 17-13 deficit with 12 minutes left in the game to win 20-19 vs. Maine South, despite playing without one of their top receivers who missed the game due to an injury. Maine South was ranked No. 1 in the AP Class 8A poll at the time.
Olson, who has been head coach since 2017, is also a special-education teacher at Palatine. He played college football at Western Illinois University.
* The Woodland District 50 Board of Education was recognized by the Illinois Association of School Boards for its exceptional governance practices.
Woodland was one of 35 Illinois school districts to earn the School Board Governance Recognition for its effective governance behaviors and commitment toward obtaining the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively govern the district.
The focus of governance recognition is on full board development and participation, rather than on individual members. Boards of education that meet the necessary requirements are recognized for the two-year honorary distinction.
* Pratiksha Bhattacharyya from Maine West High School and Darin Cheng from Maine South High School were honored by the District 207 Board of Education as "207’s Best" in the area of academic achievement during its September meeting.
Bhattacharyya has consistently been challenged in the most rigorous courses offered in District 207 and excels in all of them. She earned National Merit Commended status and is a member of National Honor Society. She participates in Link Crew, COACH Tutors, Key Club, Math Team, Medical Club, the Westerner (school newspaper), the Indian Student Association and the Math, Science and Social Science Honor societies.
Cheng has received numerous awards and is highly involved at Maine South. He earned the regional award in the Midwest Chinese Speech Contest during his freshman year and was a science department award-winner in AP physics as well as a department award in AP chemistry. Cheng has been involved in Mathletes, Model UN, Southwords (school newspaper), the National Honor Society, Chinese National Honor Society, Science National Honor Society and serves as president of Chinese Club.

Glenbrook South becomes playoff-eligible

Texto completo: Like all football teams, Glenbrook South looks to win one game at a time.
The Titans have maximized that philosophy, going 5-0 the first five weeks of the season after a 42-14 homecoming victory over Niles West on Sept. 24 at John Davis Stadium. It’s Glenbrook South’s first 5-0 start since going 6-0 in 2008.
Tough Maine South will test this run on Friday, but with the win over Niles West, Glenbrook South (5-0, 1-0 Central Suburban League South) became playoff-eligible for the first time since 2017.
Too soon?
"To me the playoffs are a long way off," said coach Dave Schoenwetter, who led the Titans to the postseason last in 2017 and played quarterback on the Titans’ 1992 and 1993 playoff teams.
"Right now I really want to focus on how much better we can get by next week and see how we can do in the CSL," he said. "Two years ago we were second place in the CSL, last year we were second from last in the CSL and so we’re looking just to make a run at being toward the top."
Run is the effective word. Against Niles West Will Collins ran the football 14 times for 114 yards and touchdowns of 17, 4 and 1 yards. Matt Burda pounded it 18 times for 105 yards and scores of 24 and 2 yards.
"Me and Will have been pretty consistent all season and running the ball very well for this team. We’re just going to keep going, carry that into Maine South," Burda said.
A returning cast of offensive linemen continued to pay dividends: Ryan Cunningham, Drew Duffy, Danny Leibrandt, Johnny Rolfes and Chris Fish, plus tight end Jack DiSano. Nick Brattleaf, David Palkovic and Trey De Lio came in for solid reps as well against Niles West (2-3, 0-1).
Burda and Collins gave the Wolves the one-two and so did Glenbrook South as a whole with two early touchdowns in five plays.
The Titans scored on the game’s first possession, Burda following motion man Chuck Gottfried’s block and spinning off a defender on a 24-yard touchdown run less than three minutes into the game.
Niles West’s Jadden Miller returned the resulting kickoff 34 yards, but Glenbrook South linebacker Trent Spaete intercepted a pass on the Wolves’ first play from scrimmage and returned it 37 yards to Niles West’s 19-yard line. Two plays later Titans quarterback Nic Swanson threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Gottfried, wide open.
"That was one of the best feelings in the world, to come out here right away, get that pick on the first play of the game pretty much, from a defensive standpoint," Spaete said. "I knew that if I made my reads the right way I’d be in the right position to make some plays, so all the credit to the coaches on that one. But I’m just happy I was able to help my team out."
Franco Fernandez-Enjo — 6-for-6 on extra points and 5 touchbacks on kickoffs — gave Glenbrook South a 14-0 lead at 7:56 of the first quarter.
Niles West, which ran a no-huddle offense all game, pulled within 14-7 after one quarter on a 35-yard touchdown pass from good-looking quarterback Jack Leons to Sam Burns, before Glenbrook South scored 21 straight second-quarter points.
Between Burda and Collins, plus Hank Leahy in for breathers, the Titans covered 83 yards in 11 rushing plays and went up 21-7 on Collins’ 17-yard run.
Helped by Fernandez-Enjo’s deep kickoffs and two punts Niles West would have liked to have back, Glenbrook South embedded itself in the Wolves’ red zone. Touchdowns by Burda and Collins gave Glenbrook South a 35-7 halftime lead.
Niles West started its season 2-0 then lost twice on COVID-19 forfeits. Wolves first-year coach Nick Torresso said only one player had the virus during those forfeits, but 32 were in quarantine.
The Wolves have athletes — Burns, Leons, Max Nauman and Andrew Mikos all are strong players — but Glenbrook South prevented them from putting it all together. Torresso made no excuses.
"We knew going into the week that field position was going to be huge. So turning the ball over on our side of the 50 against a well-coached, disciplined team that kind of eats away at the yardage, and then (two bad punts), they’re bound to score just naturally by what they run," Torresso said.
Collins and Niles West’s Enrique Ramirez-Antunez traded second-half touchdowns as Glenbrook South earned the critical fifth win with an eye on more 1-0 weeks ahead.
"Obviously a major accomplishment but we’re not done yet. We’ve got a lot of stuff to get better on, and I’m really excited to see where we can go," Spaete said.

Texto completo: "I dreamed of being a PI as a kid," private investigator Joshua Gray told me over the phone. Now he is living the dream.
At 44, Gray is a licensed investigator in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Tennessee.
He has built a business that investigates workers’ compensation claims, as well as disability and other insurance fraud. Some 90% of his work involves surveillance, he said.
In 2018, however, when Gray applied for a PI license in Maine, where he grew up, Maine state police turned him down because his social-media criticism of a 2017 police shooting that left two Maine residents dead demonstrated he lacked "good moral character."
Gray is suing Maine with the help of the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice.
"The government can’t deny you an occupational license because they think that your political speech is ill-conceived," Institute for Justice senior attorney Paul Sherman explained. The Maine Supreme Court ruled against his client, who is taking the suit all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In the age of social media, this sort of incident is likely to come up again.
Occupational licensing boards, Sherman warned, "routinely act as if the First Amendment doesn’t apply to them."
About one in five working Americans needs a license to make a living, the Institute for Justice estimates.
So, pay attention.
If your views conflict with the powers that be where you live, authorities could yank your ability to make a living.
Gray definitely got some details wrong as he opined on Facebook about the Feb. 10, 2017, shooting that left Amber Fagre, 18, and Kadhar Bailey, 25, dead.
Gray exhibited a photo of the car in which Fagre and Bailey were shot. It showed, he wrote, "a possible drunk, off duty and corrupt (officer) murdered Amber Fagre."
Wrong. The officer Gray named did not shoot Fagre — another officer did — but he did shoot Bailey, who apparently had just committed an armed burglary.
When a Maine attorney general report identified the police shooters, Gray corrected himself online.
Ultimately, the Maine attorney general ruled that officers acted in self-defense.
Gray argues that opining on a police shooting as it was "unfolding and developing" is bound to be fluid, so his correcting the record cleans the slate. He also differentiated between his comments on the shooting, which did not involve his PI work, and his more thorough work product.
There’s no defending some of Gray’s smears.
The police officer denied in an affidavit not only that he had been drinking that day but also that he ever has drunk alcohol in his life.
"So I posted to social media that (he) was off duty and possibly drinking. Many cops start drinking after a long shift," Gray wrote, before adding an ethnic smear in what ostensively was his defense.
Gray since has maintained that the failure of authorities to conduct an alcohol test after the shooting itself is suspect.
"Once you find holes in a report, you tend to disbelieve the entire report," he offered, apparently unaware of how that standard might reflect on him.
But then, free speech is messy. That’s why you don’t want to give government officials license to decide that people who criticize them can’t work in their chosen profession.
If Maine can say no to Gray because he criticized a police shooting or they didn’t like the way he criticized it, and the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the Maine ruling, authorities elsewhere will see the end product as a green light to slam the door on their critics.
Health care workers, hair stylists and cabdrivers could find themselves unable to work if they publicly disagree with the actions or pronouncements of state officials.
I disagree with most of what Gray wrote, but I defend his right to express his viewpoint.

Szczepura fits into new role, Maine West handles Maine East

Texto completo: Maine West junior Daria Szczepura, who began the season as a defensive specialist, played all-around for the first time on Monday night when the Warriors’ girls volleyball team defeated Niles North.
"She stepped into that role really well," said Maine West assistant coach Ally Kent. "We are really proud of her and can’t wait to see her keep growing as an outside hitter. She is very athletic and steps up to whatever challenge we give her."
That was certainly the case on Wednesday night as Szczepura played her all-around role to the hilt, collecting 4 kills, 6 digs and serving her longest run of the season to break open the first set.
And add a setting assist she made on senior Viviana’s Ramirez’s match-high seventh kill that ended the Central Suburban North contest in favor of the Warriors 25-14, 25-11 over Maine East in Park Ridge.
The Warriors (12-8, 6-1) won their sixth straight conference match after a three-set loss to Deerfield (20-3).
"We can’t wait for another chance (at Deerfield on Oct. 5)," Kent said. "We are going to keep working hard, pushing in practice and be ready for them."
With the Warriors holding a 13-9 lead following a kill by Ramirez (3 blocks) in Set 1, Szczepura was ready for her second visit of the night to the service line.
She recorded a season-best 8 straight points, including 4 aces (3 straight), as the visitors sped to a 21-9 advantage.
"I was just focusing on the zones my coach was giving me," Szczepura said.
"She hits all her zones," Kent said. "Any time I give her anything, she is up to the challenge and she executes, which is important."
As usual, Clare Olson, who produced a nifty second-attack kill for a 3-0 lead in Set 2, executed the offense in stellar fashion, dishing out 21 assists.
Paige Foster benefitted from Olson’s sets as the freshman put down 6 kills. "Clare (senior setter) always steps up and she definitely was very helpful tonight," Kent added.
Junior Celestina Onyeise (2 blocks) put down a kill to end a 3-point service run by Szczepura that made the score 23-11 in the second set. Onyeise (2 blocks) then came up with a block for the penultimate point of the match.
"She (Onyeise) didn’t play last spring because of COVID-19," Kent said. "So having her back this fall we weren’t sure how she progressed but she has stepped up and takes feedback real well and applies it really well in a match."
Maine East coach Rintu Philip said his team’s (3-13, 1-4) back row defense was key.
"Our libero (Madison Serrano) is always our fastest player on the court," he said. "She is hands down our best defensive player. Delila Zvizdic is another back row player we depend on and Mahima Chokshi played well. Credit goes to Maine West. They played clean volleyball, great defense and were picking her (Chokshi) up.
"Obviously, we didn’t have a good passing game today and that clearly changed the game. We have a young team and today we didn’t have serve receive but we will work on that for our next match."

Texto completo: The Hawks are back flying high again.
A week after they were stunned by Palatine, Maine South responded with a resounding 41-0 win over Glenbrook North Friday in their Central Suburban South opener in Northbrook.
The Hawks (4-1, 1-0) bolted to 20-0 at halftime and put it cruise mode from there.
Rowan Keefe tossed a pair of touchdown passes of 23 and 9 yards to Wil Guzaldo. Frank Bartell had a two-yard touchdown run and an interception. Mike Sajenko had a two-yard touchdown run. Alan Bielski threw a late 30-yard touchdown pass to Tony Valdez.
Maine South’s defense, led by Teddy Gianaris, Valdez, Kevin Wolff, Tommy Locascio and Bartell, pitched their first shutout of the season. They have allowed 46 points this season.
On Friday, the Maine South defense forced a pair of turnovers from Glenbrook North (2-3, 0-1). It included an interception by Bartell, and the Hawks also blocked a punt.
Maine South will play just their second home game of the season next Friday.
The Hawks will host unbeaten Glenbrook South (5-0, 1-0).

Texto completo: The Delta variant is finding clusters of unvaccinated people even in some of the best-vaccinated parts of the country, such as Maine. A Covid-19 surge in the New England state has filled hospitals and put dozens of mostly unvaccinated people on ventilators, setting records for the state.
The problem, public-health experts say, is the variant's high transmissibility combined with the relaxation of precautions such as wearing masks. Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations have also flared among mostly unvaccinated people in Vermont and western Massachusetts, highlighting the risk Delta poses even in states with the best track records for getting shots in arms.
"The Delta variant is so much more contagious that it doesn't need much kindling to continue to burn," said Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at nonprofit health system MaineHealth.
New England leads the nation in Covid-19 inoculations, which health experts say provides a buffer against the virus. Nearly 69% of Maine's total population of roughly 1.4 million is fully vaccinated, putting the state far ahead of the nation's 56% full-vaccination rate for the entire population while trailing only Vermont and Connecticut.
Public-health experts and doctors said they don't believe New England on the whole will see Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths come close to the same levels as last winter. Still, many Northern states face a test in coming months as the weather turns colder and people head inside, where respiratory viruses can easily spread , and as people get together for the holidays.
Despite some signs of improvements at Maine hospitals this week, the facilities are under significant strain, said Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He told reporters Wednesday that it was too soon to say the current surge is in retreat.
The state went from four people on ventilators at one point in July to more than 40 by mid-September. By Wednesday, the tally was 31, Dr. Shah said. Hospitals say a significant majority of ventilated patients are unvaccinated, according to the state.
The seven-day average for new cases in Maine, affected somewhat by a backlog of case data the state is processing, was above 520 a day Tuesday, up from averages below 20 as recently as mid-July, Johns Hopkins University data show.
The state has reported 90 deaths for September, through Tuesday, compared with 32 in August, according to Johns Hopkins. With about 99% of people over age 65 receiving at least one vaccine shot, Maine has had one of the lowest seven-day rates of Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people, CDC data show. Death reports typically lag several weeks behind cases, researchers say, and reflect a time when daily cases were lower.
Delta is exploiting differences in vaccination rates within New England. While more than three-quarters of people are fully vaccinated in Maine's most populous county, Cumberland, which includes Portland, the rate is 53% in more rural Somerset County. The case rate in Somerset County was recently several times higher than in Cumberland, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"I also see that very few people are masked" in less-vaccinated areas, said Dr. Mills, whose sister is Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. The governor last week implored more people to get the shots, calling the state's crisis preventable.
At Portland's Maine Medical Center, part of MaineHealth and the state's largest hospital, nearly all the Covid-19 patients on ventilators in the recent surge were unvaccinated, and those who had gotten the shots had significantly compromised immune systems, said David Seder, chief of critical-care services.
"We're getting some really catastrophically ill young people, and some are otherwise healthy people," Dr. Seder said.
Maine has also seen a rash of cases among school children . The state stopped requiring masks in school when a state of emergency expired on June 30, and some schools haven't mandated masks.
To be sure, New England has fared better than some less-vaccinated hot spots that have recently been hit hard, from the Deep South to Alaska. Maine over the past week had New England's highest seven-day rate of new cases per 100,000 residents, but still ranked middle-of-the pack nationally and far behind other surging states like Alaska, West Virginia and Montana.
But measured against New England's own recent record, the region has some trouble spots. Vermont recently set records for new daily case counts, driven largely by unvaccinated people, said Michael Pieciak, commissioner of Vermont's Department of Financial Regulation, who manages Covid-19 data analysis for Republican Gov. Phil Scott.
The Delta variant has exploited vulnerable areas in Massachusetts, too, like Hampden County, which has one of the lowest rates of fully vaccinated people in the state at about 56% of the county's total population.
Baystate Health, a healthcare system in Western Massachusetts, went from four Covid-19 patients in early July to more than 100 a few weeks ago, said Chief Executive Mark Keroack. "We really have been getting slammed here," he said.
About 75% of Baystate Health's Covid-19 patients are unvaccinated, Dr. Keroack said, and those that are vaccinated are older or immunocompromised and often less sick than unvaccinated patients. The number of Covid-19 patients at Baystate Health dropped to about 70 as of Monday; Dr. Keroack said he expects cases to rise again in his area in the coming weeks.
"There are going to be pockets that pop-up in unvaccinated areas," he added. "It's going to vary a lot from region to region."
Many doctors and public-health experts hope New England's higher vaccination levels overall, plus immunity some other people carry from prior infections, will restrain Delta-driven surges this winter. The region could also benefit from the rollout of boosters for vulnerable, older people and the potential authorization of shots for children ages 5-11 , health experts said.
"The most reasonable prediction is that cases will increase over the winter but not nearly as much as last year," said Isaac Weisfuse, a medical epidemiologist at Cornell University Public Health.
Nationwide, the surge in Delta-driven cases has cooled in recent weeks, hospitalizations are declining and epidemiologists hope deaths will level off soon, too. The degree to which people continue precautions such as masking indoors, getting tested and staying home when they feel sick will influence Covid-19's fall and winter trajectory, in addition to vaccination coverage, Dr. Weisfuse and other public-health experts say.
"Things are still unsettled," said Dr. Shah, head of Maine's CDC. "There's still a lot going on, and we're not out of this yet."

Texto completo: "I want more," one of my dining companions said.
There were three of us sitting in the low din of the Basin, the spacious bar at one end of Henry's Depot in Sanford. Near closing time on a weeknight, the place was buzzing with both people and live music as a guitar slinger deftly tackled classic rock instrumentals. His guitar gently wept. To some extent, so did my friend.
"More of what?" I asked.
"Just more," she said. "Let's get one more thing."
We'd already conquered a selection of eats from The Current Seafood Counter - the shrimp fritters, the Connecticut lobster roll, the blackened mahi sandwich, the smoked fish dip - plus a chili-laden Coney dog from Maggie Dog, one stall over. But it's hard to resist an Oliver Twistian plea, even from a grown woman with a belly full of food. And so, peel and eat shrimp it was.
I managed one, but I knew it would be good from the moment I picked it up. It was ideally sized, firm, redolent of lemon and cayenne and other infused goodness, but none more than its pure, unadulterated shrimpiness.
Simplicity and clean flavors were something The Current's owner, Mike Smith, had front of mind when he opened the stall, which recently passed its one-year mark.
"I didn't invent seafood. I'm not going to reinvent seafood, but I've been in
Florida a long time and the peel-and-eat shrimp here is way too often overboiled, overcooked, over-seasoned."
This heavy-handedness is something I've found with frequency over the years myself, and the reason I almost never order anything blackened. Especially seafood. I theorize this unfortunate common practice is the reason people complain about fish tasting fishy.
Not the case with The Current's mahi sandwich, I am happy to report. It's as beautifully done as any mahi (or blackened, for that matter) handheld could be - seared well enough to remain composed but beautifully tender. This fish is so often overcooked, in particular in casual, churn-it-out seafood settings.
The Current - in its food-hall location - is of course casual, but offering quality in simple surroundings was Smith's aim, as was a menu that drew inspiration from the Northeast.
No stranger to Orlando's food scene, Smith spent years working with the beloved Imperial brand - he opened its second location here in Sanford nine years ago, then managed the Orlando location before heading back to the Bokey to open the Sullivan, the Imperial's neighbor and sister venue.
All the while, though, ideas that percolated through time spent working in places like Chicago, New York and Maine remained. A year ago, at 50, Smith decided it was time to pull the trigger on a couple. First up was The Current. Just a couple of months ago, hot dog joint Maggie Dog - named after Smith's beloved pup - slid into the space next door.
"I love those foods, and so a lot of my ideas are just selfish ones," he jokes. "Seafood in Florida, so often it's either that typical low-level, over-fried, over-blackened basket - or it's fine dining."
Smith sought to do something mid-level, high quality and approachable - with a reasonable price point as well. Sales at The Current - and items like that mahi sandwich (just wow) - say he's hitting the mark. That and his waning ability to play with the menu.
Ask him about the shrimp burger and Smith will laugh.
"That one's driving me nuts!" he says, noting that every time he tries to pull it off the board, customers revolt.
"Don't get me wrong, I like it," he says of what's essentially a shrimp cake, "egg, panko, onion, peppers and a lotta, lotta shrimp - really shrimp-heavy."
They deep-fry the thing before topping it with grilled pineapple and teriyaki cabbage slaw.
"But it's a fluke I tried out of the blue and it stuck hard. I tell people I'm thinking about taking it off and they look at me like they're gonna kill me. So I leave it," Smith says.
Those fritters are shrimp-heavy, too, turning what's far-too-often a filler-laden disappointment into something fresh, fried-to-order and chunky with meat.
The warm, buttery Connecticut lobster roll is a staple now, too, alongside its cold Maine cousin.
"It sells better," says Smith, noting that he's now doing about 120 lobster rolls a week. Piled high with tender hunks and served alongside Old Bay fries, at $25 it's priced lower than it should be these days, but Smith says it's good marketing.
"It brings in the wife, maybe the husband and the kids get something else," he hypothesizes. "And to be known for having a good lobster roll is fun."
So, too, is the setting, which he finds ideal for this stage of the concept's development.
"Henry's Depot is all over the place and it works. There's a synergy with all the different concepts. We're all conscientious of what each other is doing, making sure we don't step on one another's toes. It's good for families and groups of friends who have different tastes. We have a great patio and with the fall coming up it's a nice place to sit."
In what he calls "the craziest year to open a business that he's ever seen," things are chucking along well enough at The Current to imagine jumping ship to a location up the block at some point as young Maggie Dog - with its creative takes on tube steak - finds its feet. (If you go, try that rabbit sausage with the house-made blackberry Dijon!) Maybe next year.
"I'd love to have a full bar and oyster bar," he says, "or maybe something more fast-casual, a Tijuana Flats-style place that's not a fancy night out, simple enough to do a couple of them in the region ... but I'll let fate dictate the future."
And go where the Current leads him.

Texto completo: immediately by the lab or their doctor — it affects the closely watched daily tally of case numbers.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said 13 additional staff members have been added since last week to the team that reviews positive test results to distinguish new cases from duplicates. Additionally, Shah noted that the number of positive cases arriving daily for vetting ebbed slightly from well over 600 a day last week to about 550 daily as of Wednesday.
But Shah said case numbers are only one metric his team uses “to understand how things are unfolding in real time.” Perhaps the best indicator, Shah said, is the positivity rate, which is the percentage of total tests that come back as positive. Maine’s seven-day positivity rate dipped to 4.6% on Wednesday from 6.1% two weeks ago. Maine’s testing rate also has increased 19% over the past two weeks.
Hospitalizations ticked up from 218 on Tuesday to 225 on Wednesday but are lower than the record-high of 235 patients in the hospital with COVID-19 on Saturday. There were 71 people in critical care beds and 31 connected to ventilators on Wednesday.
Always reluctant to give “crystal ball” predictions about the pandemic in Maine, Shah gave a characteristically cautious assessment as he noted “some signs of optimism on the horizon — but there are still a lot of signs of concern.”
“When you take all of that together there are some very early, way-too-preliminary, unclear signs that there might be an easing,” Shah said during a Wednesday briefing with the media. “But I’m not taking that to the bank yet.”
Dr. James Jarvis, the COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, which operates Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and other hospitals around the state, also hopes that the delta-driven surge is easing.
“It looks like the state of Maine is kind of at a plateau but at a plateau at one of the highest (levels) of numbers that we have seen during this entire pandemic, including last winter when … we were hopeful that was going to be the worst that we saw,” Jarvis said in a separate briefing with reporters. “I do hope that, as we’ve seen in other parts of the country, that numbers will start to decrease over the next few weeks. That is a hope and that is not a forecast.”
Maine has among the highest vaccination rates in the nation and has consistently reported among the lowest COVID-19 case and death rates throughout the pandemic. Yet the state’s seven-day case rate of 271.9 cases per 100,000 residents is the highest in New England and is higher than every other Northeastern and mid-Atlantic state except Delaware on Wednesday, according to the latest data from the U.S. CDC.
The seven-day average of new cases of COVID-19 stood at 559 on Wednesday, up from 456 cases per day for the week ending Sept. 15. The highest-ever seven-day average of just over 600 COVID-19 cases occurred in mid-January but Maine was averaging just a few dozen cases a day in early July.
To date, the Maine CDC has tracked 89,064 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 since the coronavirus was first detected in the state in March 2020. There have been at least 1,022 deaths linked to COVID-19 in Maine during the pandemic.
The latest surge has been driven largely by infections among unvaccinated individuals with the more contagious delta variant, which accounted for 99% of all cases in the Maine CDC’s most recent report on the genetic sequencing of COVID-19 cases.
As of Tuesday evening, 73.6 of all eligible Mainers and 64.8% of the state’s 1.3 million residents had received the full regimen of doses needed for full inoculation against COVID-19. But vaccination rates vary widely across the state, ranging from more than 85% of eligible Cumberland County residents being fully vaccinated to just 60% in rural Somerset County.
While there had been roughly 2,700 so-called “breakthrough” infections among fully vaccinated individuals as of Sept. 24, the vast majority of new cases in Maine as well as 65% to 75% of all hospitalizations have been among the state’s smaller pool of unvaccinated individuals.
Medical studies show that fully vaccinated people are much less likely to require hospitalization or die from COVID-19 than their unvaccinated counterparts. Even so, the number of fully vaccinated individuals requiring hospitalization or critical care has risen in recent days.
As of Tuesday, fully vaccinated individuals accounted for nine of the 31 people in critical care beds at Eastern Maine Medical Center and other intensive care units operated by Northern Light Health. One-third of all COVID-related hospitalizations within Northern Light’s network were fully vaccinated patients.
Asked about the serious cases among vaccinated individuals, Shah said numbers fluctuate but that breakthrough cases are inevitable because vaccines help prevent serious illness and death, not necessarily infection. Federal regulators have recommended a third or “booster” shot for people vaccinated with Pfizer because of studies showing the protection of the vaccine may wane over time.
“In a state with only, hypothetically, 10% of the population vaccinated, there wouldn’t be that many breakthrough cases,” Shah said. “We are the third most vaccinated state in the country and, as a result of that, we may see more breakthrough cases.”
Jarvis said “the overwhelming majority” of people requiring hospitalization have been unvaccinated even though they account for a minority — roughly 26% — of the state’s eligible population.
“The vaccine is still clearly the best way out of this pandemic,” Jarvis said during the Northern Light news conference.
There have been 16,520 additional or “booster” shots administered in Maine, according to the state CDC data. Of those, roughly 6,500 have received Pfizer booster shots since federal regulators announced the guidelines last week.
Health care providers and pharmacies in Maine have started scheduling appointments to administer third doses of the Pfizer vaccine for individuals who qualify for the booster shots. Those include individuals who are 65 or older, younger people with underlying medical conditions, and people who work in health care, as teachers, in day care facilities, in grocery stores or in other settings with higher risk of occupational exposure to the virus.
Based on federal guidelines, booster shots can be administered to eligible individuals starting six months after their second Pfizer shot. Additionally, federal regulators had previously authorized booster shots for individuals with severely compromised immune systems — such as organ transplant recipients and cancer patients — as long as they were vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna drugs.
Federal regulators are still reviewing the medical data about more widespread booster shots for individuals who received either the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

Lawmakers vote to fight government rules intended to protect right whales
The Maine Legislature is threatening to fight the federal government in court over a set of controversial new seasonal restrictions on lobster harvesting in the Gulf of Maine.
Legislators approved a joint order Wednesday from Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, that would allow the Legislative Council to take legal action in support of Maine lobstermen affected by the regulations.
Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released new rules for New England’s lobster fishery, aimed at reducing the risk to critically endangered North Atlantic right whales and other whale species.
The goal is to reduce the risk to the whales by at least 60%.
The new rules will require lobstermen to string more traps on a single rope and to use weaker ropes to allow entangled whales to break free, among other changes, and will put more than 950 square miles of the Gulf of Maine off limits to traditional lobstering from October through January, the area’s most lucrative season.
Lobstermen say the new regulations will be expensive, dangerous, burdensome and impractical, and will not reduce the risk to whales.
“The latest rules imposed by the federal government will do nothing to help the endangered species they were designed to protect while having damning consequences on hardworking Mainers and their families,” Jackson said in a statement. “The Maine Legislature will not sit idly by while this iconic industry is under threat. We are ready to take legal action to right this wrong and support the hardworking men and women in the lobstering industry.”
Most of the changes required by the rule will go into effect May 1, 2022, which is the start of the American lobster/Jonah crab fishing year, while the most immediate change to impose new, seasonally restricted areas off Maine and Massachusetts is to go into effect Oct. 18.
Federal officials said the closure will directly affect about 60 lobstermen in the restricted area, and another 60 who might be affected by the others relocating, but not the vast majority of lobstermen, who fish closer to shore.
For the affected lobster harvesters, officials expect the closure will cost them 5% to 10% of their total revenue each year.
Lobstermen who fish in the area say the estimates are grossly off the mark. They say revenue losses for those affected could be closer to 50%.
The plan does allow buoyless or “ropeless” fishing — a new, experimental technology that brings lobster traps to the surface using acoustic signals — but the technology has not been tested in Maine.
The joint order comes just two days after the Maine Lobstermen’s Association sued regulators to protect the fishery. The association has more than 1,200 members.
The Legislature’s joint order is not legal action in and of itself, but it does authorize the Legislative Council to take “such legal action as it determines appropriate and fiscally feasible,” including but not limited to joining any pending legal action as an intervenor, providing an amicus brief in any pending legal action or initiating new litigation.
The Lobstermen’s Association lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., takes aim at a biological opinion published by the National Marine Fisheries Service in May. The fisheries service is named as a defendant along with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and fisheries service Assistant Administrator for Fisheries Janet Coit.
It argues the restrictions are based on flawed science, pose an existential threat to Maine’s lobster industry and will not shield whales from extinction.
If successful, the lawsuit would require the Marine Fisheries Service to reassess its biological opinion. The recently created rules would remain in place until new rules are developed with an updated review.
Another lawsuit filed Monday by the Maine Lobster Union, Fox Island Lobster Co. and Damon Family Lobster Co. aims to stop enforcement of the October-to-January seasonal closure.
Fisheries regulators created the seasonally restricted area in order to spread risk responsibility across multiple jurisdictions even though lobstering is far more important to Maine than to nearby states, the companies said in their legal complaint.
Moreover, right whale sightings in the area are extremely rare, and regulators did not evaluate the efficacy of existing regulations to prevent death and injury to whales, the complaint alleges.
The companies are seeking injunctive relief to pause the closure and get a final rule revision.
State Rep. Genevieve McDonald, D-Stonington, a lobster boat captain, said in a statement she fully supports taking “every possible action” to protect the lobster fishery from what she sees as unfair and arbitrary restrictions.
“We should not be basing regulations on outdated science, especially when the livelihoods of so many people hang in the balance,” she said.
The Maine Department of Marine Resources, which opposes the federal restrictions, told legislators this month it would not sue over the new rules, but would join the ongoing 2018 conservation case in order to assist in the effort against the plaintiffs.
Gov. Janet Mills issued a statement Monday saying Maine has been granted “intervenor” status in the case. An intervenor is neither a plaintiff nor a defendant, but is recognized by the court as having an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Only about 360 North Atlantic right whales remain, and the federal plan calls for a 98% risk reduction of serious injury and mortality in the coming decade.
Since 2017, 34 right whales have been killed, according to NOAA. An earlier estimate of 33 deaths attributed 21 to Canada and 12 to the United States.
Eleven incidents were attributed to ship strikes, including at least two in U.S. waters, but none that can be linked to the Maine lobster industry.
The most recent known Maine entanglement occurred in 2004, but the whale survived.

Texto completo: Officials say they don't intend to rescind an August vote that left it up to town employees to decide if they want to be vaccinated.
challenge Mills, state
Canaan officials say employee vaccinations shall remain optional

CANAAN — Officials say they won’t require vaccinations for town employees, including EMS personnel and other emergency workers, despite a state-imposed deadline for all health care workers in Maine to be vaccinated.
The Select Board in August voted to make vaccinations against COVID-19 voluntary for all municipal workers, and town leaders this week said they don’t intend to change their position even though the town could face state sanctions.
Fire Chief Troy Bowden declined to comment this week when contacted by the Morning Sentinel. “I’m not gonna comment on that, I already know what you’re asking,” he said.
The town’s website says the fire department is “actively seeking volunteers,” and town leaders have said they’re concerned that a vaccination mandate would result in people leaving the department.
Gov. Janet Mills announced the requirement for health care workers on Aug. 12. The deadline for vaccination was initially Friday but she announced that the deadline would be extended to Oct. 29 to give health care workers more time to receive a vaccine.
President Joe Biden previously announced his administration is requiring that all employers with at least 100 workers ensure that their workforce is fully vaccinated, or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to regularly produce a negative test result.
The executive director of the Maine Municipal Association, Cathy Conlow said, “Municipalities are making decisions for themselves based off prevalence of the disease in regards to masking and vaccination.”
Most towns will wait for the state Department of Labor to release guidelines before making further decisions, and then will consult with their attorneys, Conlow said.
But the Maine labor department issued a statement on Sept. 17 that says, “The U.S. Department of Labor has informed the Maine Department of Labor that its forthcoming COVID-19 vaccination requirement will apply to public sector employers in Maine, including state, county and local governments and public school systems.”
Canaan Selectman Daniel Harriman said Tuesday that town leaders are aware of the state vaccination requirements but that the Select Board doesn’t intend to change its August vote. He declined to comment further.
A message left with Mills’ press office about any punitive measures the state may impose against towns that don’t comply was not returned Wednesday.
In the adjacent town of Skowhegan, there’s been pushback against the vaccine requirement. But Fire Chief Shawn Howard said at a recent selectmen’s meeting that, “Unfortunately, we have to abide by these laws and we have to follow through with making sure that all of our employees are vaccinated. This may mean that we lose some employees.”

Texto completo: Though the seven-day case average continues to rise as Maine experiences one of the worst surges of the pandemic, the state's positivity rate dips to 4.6%.
Maine officials give ‘signs of optimism’ surge could ease

Maine added a near-record number of COVID-19 cases on Wednesday although state health officials also noted that other, closely tracked indicators offered “signs of optimism” that the current surge is easing.
The 867 cases reported Wednesday represented the second-largest one-day jump, and was exceeded only by the 1,008 cases reported Tuesday for the previous three days. The last time the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention reported more than 800 cases in a single day was in mid-January during the worst surge of the now 18-month-long pandemic.
No additional COVID-related deaths were reported Wednesday.
Daily case numbers appear likely to remain high in the coming days as Maine CDC staff review roughly 2,500 positive test results reported to the agency over the past week. While that backlog has no impact on when patients learn of a positive test result — because most are notified immediately by the lab or their doctor — it affects the closely watched daily tally of case numbers.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said 13 additional staff members have been added since last week to the team that reviews positive test results to distinguish new cases from duplicates. Additionally, Shah noted that the number of positive cases arriving daily for vetting ebbed slightly from well over 600 a day last week to about 550 daily as of Wednesday.
But Shah said case numbers are only one metric his team uses “to understand how things are unfolding in real time.” Perhaps the best indicator, Shah said, is the positivity rate, which is the percentage of total tests that come back as positive. Maine’s seven-day positivity rate dipped to 4.6% on Wednesday from 6.1% two weeks ago. Maine’s testing rate also has increased 19% over the past two weeks.
Hospitalizations ticked up from 218 on Tuesday to 225 on Wednesday but are lower than the record-high of 235 patients in the hospital with COVID-19 on Saturday. There were 71 people in critical care beds and 31 connected to ventilators on Wednesday.
Always reluctant to give “crystal ball” predictions about the pandemic in Maine, Shah gave a characteristically cautious assessment as he noted “some signs of optimism on the horizon — but there are still a lot of signs of concern.”
“When you take all of that together there are some very early, way-too-preliminary, unclear signs that there might be an easing,” Shah said during a Wednesday briefing with the media. “But I’m not taking that to the bank yet.”
Dr. James Jarvis, the COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, which operates Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and other hospitals around the state, also hopes that the delta-driven surge is easing.
“It looks like the state of Maine is kind of at a plateau but at a plateau at one of the highest (levels) of numbers that we have seen during this entire pandemic, including last winter when … we were hopeful that was going to be the worst that we saw,” Jarvis said in a separate briefing with reporters. “I do hope that, as we’ve seen in other parts of the country, that numbers will start to decrease over the next few weeks.

Texto completo: Maranacook, Maine Central Institute in running in KVAC B; Messalonskee, Brunswick among KVAC A favorites.
Ryan Meserve has a good problem on his hands.
Whereas many high school golf teams hope to lean on two or three talented golfers every year, the Maranacook golf coach has enviable depth for countable spots in the lineup.
“I’ve been really lucky this year, and I think this is what’s helped us kind of weather what every team goes through, which is ups and downs,” Meserve said. “I have seven solid players that I could put in any spot.”
Until a 6.5-2.5 loss to Cony on Sept. 21 in a tri-match with Erskine Academy, the Black Bears had been enjoying an undefeated regular season.
Maranacook is one of three teams — along with Leavitt and Maine Central Institute — vying for a victory at the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference Class B Shootout on Thursday at the Rockland Golf Club. The KVAC A Shootout will also take place Thursday, at the Brunswick Golf Club. Brunswick, Messalonskee, Edward Little and Hampden Academy will compete for the KVAC A Shootout crown.
The KVAC Shootout victors will be crowned conference champions.
“I’ve been incredibly happy,” Meserve said. “They’re a real great group of kids, they try really hard. They take to action the stuff that we talk about in practice. They’ve had a really good season and really embrace the role of not just focusing on their own match, but they understand the team concept of it.
“It’s been a good number of years since I’ve been back in the Shootout. This team is nice to have that competitive end of the season aspect, so that’s great.”
Sophomore Wyatt Folsom, whom Meserve said is averaging a 38 score this fall, is the Black Bears’ top golfer.
“He had his best round in the divisional playoffs,” Meserve said. “He shot a 35, even par. Nine straight pars, had a really great round. He was playing (Cony’s Ollie Roderigue), just the week before when Cony gave us our only loss of the season, and those guys at Cony, their home course played really well, so I know the Maranacook team was pretty motivated to see them again (Monday) and finish in the playoffs.”
Freshman James Marr is the team’s No. 2 golfer. Brandon Chilton, Alex Trafton, Ben Jewett, Wyatt Lyons and Trent Murray also contribute for Maranacook.
“(Folsom and No. 1 and Marr at No. 2) has pretty much been the constant all year,” Meserve said. “James is just super steady, (hitting) fairways, greens or just in front and chip up. He’s played really well.”
Meserve said he expects a great challenge at the Shootout from both MCI, which defeated Belfast on Tuesday to reach the event, and Leavitt, another team that had a strong regular season. The Hornets are paced by No. 1 golfer Ruby Haylock, who won last year’s Maine Women’s Amateur.
In KVAC A, Messalonskee (18-1) has enjoyed a strong season. The Eagles cruised past Mt. Blue 9-0 on Tuesday to cement their spot in the Shootout.
“At (18-1), you can’t be disappointed,” coach Gene Dumont said. “The team has played well, they’ve gotten better, if you can get better. We’re strong, we’re deep. I’ve got a lot of choices to start (in the lineup). My top two or three players are very strong. We’re happy to be where we’re at and we’re looking forward to the playoffs.”
Messalonskee’s top golfer is senior Brandon Bearce, a Waterville transfer. The Eagles have also received consistent low scores from Mitch Grant, Sam Seekins, Jude Lilly and Brady Bumford. Dumont said he knew the Eagles would play well this season, but adding Bearce to the mix has provided a spark.
“(Bearce) is a very strong player, he’s our No. 1 now,” Dumont said. “When you have a No. 1 move into a strong, deep team, it just makes it that much stronger.”
Brunswick fought past rival Mt. Ararat on Monday for its place in the Shootout, beating the Eagles by 10 strokes (171-181).
“We were fired up coming into (the Mt. Ararat match),” said Austin Stromick of Brunswick, the low medalist of the match with a 39, after beating Mt. Ararat. “We knew there was more at stake today, so Charlie (Austin) wanted to up our game knowing that we’d have this opportunity.”

Texto completo: Litchfield Fire & Rescue stands to lose about five of its 22 employees as a result of the vaccine mandate.

LITCHFIELD — Town officials have asked Gov. Janet Mills to reverse the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers.
In a letter to Mills, Litchfield officials expressed concern the requirement infringes on the philosophical and religious freedoms of health care workers and could lead to employee shortages in EMS agencies across the state.
Originally introduced in August, the mandate required all health care workers to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1. It defined health care workers as anyone working for a hospital, multi-level health care facility, home health agency, nursing facility, residential care facility, state-licensed intermediate care facility, and EMS workers.
Earlier this month, Gov. Mills announced that the deadline would be extended to Oct. 29 in order to give health care workers more time to receive the vaccine. She also said that $146 million in state and federal funding would be provided to nursing facilities, residential care facilities, adult family care homes, and hospitals to help them handle workforce recruitment and retention amid the pandemic.
The packet sent to the governor includes a cover letter from Town Manager Kelly Weissenfels, written statements from Fire Chief Michael Sherman and Gary Parker, chairperson of the Litchfield Board of Selectmen, and a resolution signed and unanimously approved by the selectmen.
In his statement, Sherman said the department stood to lose about a quarter of its roster of 22 as a result of the rule. He said those crew members have ideological objections to the mandate.
The chief clarified that the town is opposed to the mandate itself, but not vaccines in general.
“These things often get painted as a bunch of anti-vaxxers,” Sherman said. “We’re talking about people that are intelligent, people that have had conversations with their doctors. We’re talking about people who give these things a lot of thought and have had numerous vaccines in the past. We’re not talking about a bunch of people opposed to vaccines. We’re opposing a mandate; we’re opposing a forced vaccination.”
Weissenfels shared similar sentiments about the crew in his cover letter to Gov. Janet Mills.
“These are people who willingly drop what they are doing at a moment’s notice to go to the aid of friends and neighbors,” the town manager wrote. “They understand personal sacrifice. For over a year they have operated safely amid the COVID-19 crisis. These are people who are generally in favor of vaccinations, and should not be dismissed.”
A resolution unanimously approved by the board of selectmen was also included in the packet, which stated that the board “urges reversion of the [mandate] and calls on the state to do better in planning and implementation of COVID-19 vaccine-related safety measures.”
As of Monday, a total of eight staff at Litchfield Fire & Rescue are unvaccinated. Of those eight, Sherman said two are planning to receive the vaccine prior to the deadline, and another has received information from his doctor that he is medically exempt. He said it is currently unclear if this exemption will be recognized under the rules of the mandate.
As for how the town will handle the potential loss, Weissenfels said Litchfield would likely increase mutual aid with providers in surrounding communities.
Sherman noted that some members of the department, while they may be opposed to the mandate, are still deciding to get the vaccine.
“They believe it’s more important to remain able to respond to calls and be a part of the department than fighting this,” he said. “That is occurring here. I think it’s important to note that people who are opposed to this are making the choice to go and get it, despite their opposition because they believe it’s the right thing to do.”
Sherman said he has no intention of going against the mandate or resigning in protest. Instead, he plans to follow the law while fighting to have it changed or revoked.
“Even though I strongly oppose this rule, in fact, I passionately oppose this rule, as Chief I have no option but compliance,” he wrote. “Therefore it is the position of this Chief to follow the law to the best of my ability and fight as hard as I can to change it.”
At one point Sherman and Weissenfels were considering a lawsuit against the state, but are no longer pursuing that.
Weissenfels said the town is no longer searching for an attorney after learning that a class-action lawsuit against the mandate, claiming that it violated religious freedom rights, was already moving forward.
The chief said guidance from organizations like the Maine Municipal Association, the Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association, and the EMS board is that they should follow the mandate’s rules.
“Our town’s attorney advised that we follow the guidelines,” he said. “We have received no legal advice to do anything other than follow the guidelines.”
MMA Director Catherine Conlow said that while the organization doesn’t track requests and inquiries concerning the mandate, they have received several from Maine communities.
“If the questions are specific towards legal action against the mandate, we would refer them back to their counsel,” Conlow said.
Sherman said he has spoken with departments in other communities who are also opposed to the mandate. As with Litchfield, these departments also face the potential loss of employees.
“I’ve heard numbers similar to ours,” he said. “Three to four individuals is a pretty common number that these agencies stand to lose.”
Weissenfels said the town office has not received any calls from residents about the issue, but that they have received some responses on their Facebook page after posting about their opposition to the mandate.
“There were no overwhelming opinions in one direction or the other,” he said. “We have a lot of support for our volunteers, that seems to be consistent across the board.”

Texto completo: immediately by the lab or their doctor — it affects the closely watched daily tally of case numbers.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said 13 additional staff members have been added since last week to the team that reviews positive test results to distinguish new cases from duplicates. Additionally, Shah noted that the number of positive cases arriving daily for vetting ebbed slightly from well over 600 a day last week to about 550 daily as of Wednesday.
But Shah said case numbers are only one metric his team uses “to understand how things are unfolding in real time.” Perhaps the best indicator, Shah said, is the positivity rate, which is the percentage of total tests that come back as positive. Maine’s seven-day positivity rate dipped to 4.6% on Wednesday from 6.1% two weeks ago. Maine’s testing rate also has increased 19% over the past two weeks.
Hospitalizations ticked up from 218 on Tuesday to 225 on Wednesday but are lower than the record-high of 235 patients in the hospital with COVID-19 on Saturday. There were 71 people in critical care beds and 31 connected to ventilators on Wednesday.
Always reluctant to give “crystal ball” predictions about the pandemic in Maine, Shah gave a characteristically cautious assessment as he noted “some signs of optimism on the horizon — but there are still a lot of signs of concern.”
“When you take all of that together there are some very early, way-too-preliminary, unclear signs that there might be an easing,” Shah said during a Wednesday briefing with the media. “But I’m not taking that to the bank yet.”
Dr. James Jarvis, the COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, which operates Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and other hospitals around the state, also hopes that the delta-driven surge is easing.
“It looks like the state of Maine is kind of at a plateau but at a plateau at one of the highest (levels) of numbers that we have seen during this entire pandemic, including last winter when … we were hopeful that was going to be the worst that we saw,” Jarvis said in a separate briefing with reporters. “I do hope that, as we’ve seen in other parts of the country, that numbers will start to decrease over the next few weeks. That is a hope and that is not a forecast.”
Maine has among the highest vaccination rates in the nation and has consistently reported among the lowest COVID-19 case and death rates throughout the pandemic. Yet the state’s seven-day case rate of 271.9 cases per 100,000 residents is the highest in New England and is higher than every other Northeastern and mid-Atlantic state except Delaware on Wednesday, according to the latest data from the U.S. CDC.
The seven-day average of new cases of COVID-19 stood at 559 on Wednesday, up from 456 cases per day for the week ending Sept. 15. The highest-ever seven-day average of just over 600 COVID-19 cases occurred in mid-January but Maine was averaging just a few dozen cases a day in early July.
Full story at CentralMaine.com
To date, the Maine CDC has tracked 89,064 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 since the coronavirus was first detected in the state in March 2020. There have been at least 1,022 deaths linked to COVID-19 in Maine during the pandemic.
The latest surge has been driven largely by infections among unvaccinated individuals with the more contagious delta variant, which accounted for 99% of all cases in the Maine CDC’s most recent report on the genetic sequencing of COVID-19 cases.
As of Tuesday evening, 73.6 of all eligible Mainers and 64.8% of the state’s 1.3 million residents had received the full regimen of doses needed for full inoculation against COVID-19. But vaccination rates vary widely across the state, ranging from more than 85% of eligible Cumberland County residents being fully vaccinated to just 60% in rural Somerset County.
While there had been roughly 2,700 so-called “breakthrough” infections among fully vaccinated individuals as of Sept. 24, the vast majority of new cases in Maine as well as 65% to 75% of all hospitalizations have been among the state’s smaller pool of unvaccinated individuals.
Medical studies show that fully vaccinated people are much less likely to require hospitalization or die from COVID-19 than their unvaccinated counterparts. Even so, the number of fully vaccinated individuals requiring hospitalization or critical care has risen in recent days.
As of Tuesday, fully vaccinated individuals accounted for nine of the 31 people in critical care beds at Eastern Maine Medical Center and other intensive care units operated by Northern Light Health. One-third of all COVID-related hospitalizations within Northern Light’s network were fully vaccinated patients.
Asked about the serious cases among vaccinated individuals, Shah said numbers fluctuate but that breakthrough cases are inevitable because vaccines help prevent serious illness and death, not necessarily infection. Federal regulators have recommended a third or “booster” shot for people vaccinated with Pfizer because of studies showing the protection of the vaccine may wane over time.
“In a state with only, hypothetically, 10% of the population vaccinated, there wouldn’t be that many breakthrough cases,” Shah said. “We are the third most vaccinated state in the country and, as a result of that, we may see more breakthrough cases.”
Jarvis said “the overwhelming majority” of people requiring hospitalization have been unvaccinated even though they account for a minority — roughly 26% — of the state’s eligible population.
“The vaccine is still clearly the best way out of this pandemic,” Jarvis said during the Northern Light news conference.
There have been 16,520 additional or “booster” shots administered in Maine, according to the state CDC data. Of those, roughly 6,500 have received Pfizer booster shots since federal regulators announced the guidelines last week.
Health care providers and pharmacies in Maine have started scheduling appointments to administer third doses of the Pfizer vaccine for individuals who qualify for the booster shots. Those include individuals who are 65 or older, younger people with underlying medical conditions, and people who work in health care, as teachers, in day care facilities, in grocery stores or in other settings with higher risk of occupational exposure to the virus.
Based on federal guidelines, booster shots can be administered to eligible individuals starting six months after their second Pfizer shot. Additionally, federal regulators had previously authorized booster shots for individuals with severely compromised immune systems — such as organ transplant recipients and cancer patients — as long as they were vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna drugs.
Federal regulators are still reviewing the medical data about more widespread booster shots for individuals who received either the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

Texto completo: Though the seven-day case average continues to rise as Maine experiences one of the worst surges of the pandemic, the state's positivity rate dips to 4.6%.
Maine officials give ‘signs of optimism’ surge could ease

Maine added a near-record number of COVID-19 cases on Wednesday although state health officials also noted that other, closely tracked indicators offered “signs of optimism” that the current surge is easing.
The 867 cases reported Wednesday represented the second-largest one-day jump, and was exceeded only by the 1,008 cases reported Tuesday for the previous three days. The last time the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention reported more than 800 cases in a single day was in mid-January during the worst surge of the now 18-month-long pandemic.
No additional COVID-related deaths were reported Wednesday.
Daily case numbers appear likely to remain high in the coming days as Maine CDC staff review roughly 2,500 positive test results reported to the agency over the past week. While that backlog has no impact on when patients learn of a positive test result — because most are notified immediately by the lab or their doctor — it affects the closely watched daily tally of case numbers.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said 13 additional staff members have been added since last week to the team that reviews positive test results to distinguish new cases from duplicates. Additionally, Shah noted that the number of positive cases arriving daily for vetting ebbed slightly from well over 600 a day last week to about 550 daily as of Wednesday.
But Shah said case numbers are only one metric his team uses “to understand how things are unfolding in real time.” Perhaps the best indicator, Shah said, is the positivity rate, which is the percentage of total tests that come back as positive. Maine’s seven-day positivity rate dipped to 4.6% on Wednesday from 6.1% two weeks ago. Maine’s testing rate also has increased 19% over the past two weeks.
Hospitalizations ticked up from 218 on Tuesday to 225 on Wednesday but are lower than the record-high of 235 patients in the hospital with COVID-19 on Saturday. There were 71 people in critical care beds and 31 connected to ventilators on Wednesday.
Always reluctant to give “crystal ball” predictions about the pandemic in Maine, Shah gave a characteristically cautious assessment as he noted “some signs of optimism on the horizon — but there are still a lot of signs of concern.”
“When you take all of that together there are some very early, way-too-preliminary, unclear signs that there might be an easing,” Shah said during a Wednesday briefing with the media. “But I’m not taking that to the bank yet.”
Dr. James Jarvis, the COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, which operates Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and other hospitals around the state, also hopes that the delta-driven surge is easing.
“It looks like the state of Maine is kind of at a plateau but at a plateau at one of the highest (levels) of numbers that we have seen during this entire pandemic, including last winter when … we were hopeful that was going to be the worst that we saw,” Jarvis said in a separate briefing with reporters. “I do hope that, as we’ve seen in other parts of the country, that numbers will start to decrease over the next few weeks. That is a hope and that is not a forecast.”
Maine has among the highest vaccination rates in the nation and has consistently reported among the lowest COVID-19 case and death rates throughout the pandemic. Yet the state’s seven-day case rate of 271.9 cases per 100,000 residents is the highest in New England and is higher than every other Northeastern and mid-Atlantic state except Delaware on Wednesday, according to the latest data from the U.S. CDC.
The seven-day average of new cases of COVID-19 stood at 559 on Wednesday, up from 456 cases per day for the week ending Sept. 15. The highest-ever seven-day average of just over 600 COVID-19 cases occurred in mid-January but Maine was averaging just a few dozen cases a day in early July.
Full story at CentralMaine.com
To date, the Maine CDC has tracked 89,064 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 since the coronavirus was first detected in the state in March 2020. There have been at least 1,022 deaths linked to COVID-19 in Maine during the pandemic.
The latest surge has been driven largely by infections among unvaccinated individuals with the more contagious delta variant, which accounted for 99% of all cases in the Maine CDC’s most recent report on the genetic sequencing of COVID-19 cases.
As of Tuesday evening, 73.6 of all eligible Mainers and 64.8% of the state’s 1.3 million residents had received the full regimen of doses needed for full inoculation against COVID-19. But vaccination rates vary widely across the state, ranging from more than 85% of eligible Cumberland County residents being fully vaccinated to just 60% in rural Somerset County.
While there had been roughly 2,700 so-called “breakthrough” infections among fully vaccinated individuals as of Sept. 24, the vast majority of new cases in Maine as well as 65% to 75% of all hospitalizations have been among the state’s smaller pool of unvaccinated individuals.
Medical studies show that fully vaccinated people are much less likely to require hospitalization or die from COVID-19 than their unvaccinated counterparts. Even so, the number of fully vaccinated individuals requiring hospitalization or critical care has risen in recent days.
As of Tuesday, fully vaccinated individuals accounted for nine of the 31 people in critical care beds at Eastern Maine Medical Center and other intensive care units operated by Northern Light Health. One-third of all COVID-related hospitalizations within Northern Light’s network were fully vaccinated patients.
Asked about the serious cases among vaccinated individuals, Shah said numbers fluctuate but that breakthrough cases are inevitable because vaccines help prevent serious illness and death, not necessarily infection. Federal regulators have recommended a third or “booster” shot for people vaccinated with Pfizer because of studies showing the protection of the vaccine may wane over time.
“In a state with only, hypothetically, 10% of the population vaccinated, there wouldn’t be that many breakthrough cases,” Shah said. “We are the third most vaccinated state in the country and, as a result of that, we may see more breakthrough cases.”
Jarvis said “the overwhelming majority” of people requiring hospitalization have been unvaccinated even though they account for a minority — roughly 26% — of the state’s eligible population.
“The vaccine is still clearly the best way out of this pandemic,” Jarvis said during the Northern Light news conference.
There have been 16,520 additional or “booster” shots administered in Maine, according to the state CDC data. Of those, roughly 6,500 have received Pfizer booster shots since federal regulators announced the guidelines last week.
Health care providers and pharmacies in Maine have started scheduling appointments to administer third doses of the Pfizer vaccine for individuals who qualify for the booster shots. Those include individuals who are 65 or older, younger people with underlying medical conditions, and people who work in health care, as teachers, in day care facilities, in grocery stores or in other settings with higher risk of occupational exposure to the virus.
Based on federal guidelines, booster shots can be administered to eligible individuals starting six months after their second Pfizer shot. Additionally, federal regulators had previously authorized booster shots for individuals with severely compromised immune systems — such as organ transplant recipients and cancer patients — as long as they were vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna drugs.
Federal regulators are still reviewing the medical data about more widespread booster shots for individuals who received either the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

Lawmakers vote to fight government rules intended to protect right whales
The Maine Legislature is threatening to fight the federal government in court over a set of controversial new seasonal restrictions on lobster harvesting in the Gulf of Maine.
Legislators approved a joint order Wednesday from Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, that would allow the Legislative Council to take legal action in support of Maine lobstermen affected by the regulations.
Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released new rules for New England’s lobster fishery, aimed at reducing the risk to critically endangered North Atlantic right whales and other whale species.
The goal is to reduce the risk to the whales by at least 60%.
The new rules will require lobstermen to string more traps on a single rope and to use weaker ropes to allow entangled whales to break free, among other changes, and will put more than 950 square miles of the Gulf of Maine off limits to traditional lobstering from October through January, the area’s most lucrative season.
Lobstermen say the new regulations will be expensive, dangerous, burdensome and impractical, and will not reduce the risk to whales.
“The latest rules imposed by the federal government will do nothing to help the endangered species they were designed to protect while having damning consequences on hardworking Mainers and their families,” Jackson said in a statement. “The Maine Legislature will not sit idly by while this iconic industry is under threat. We are ready to take legal action to right this wrong and support the hardworking men and women in the lobstering industry.”
Most of the changes required by the rule will go into effect May 1, 2022, which is the start of the American lobster/Jonah crab fishing year, while the most immediate change to impose new, seasonally restricted areas off Maine and Massachusetts is to go into effect Oct. 18.
Federal officials said the closure will directly affect about 60 lobstermen in the restricted area, and another 60 who might be affected by the others relocating, but not the vast majority of lobstermen, who fish closer to shore.
For the affected lobster harvesters, officials expect the closure will cost them 5% to 10% of their total revenue each year.
Lobstermen who fish in the area say the estimates are grossly off the mark. They say revenue losses for those affected could be closer to 50%.
The plan does allow buoyless or “ropeless” fishing — a new, experimental technology that brings lobster traps to the surface using acoustic signals — but the technology has not been tested in Maine.
The joint order comes just two days after the Maine Lobstermen’s Association sued regulators to protect the fishery. The association has more than 1,200 members.
The Legislature’s joint order is not legal action in and of itself, but it does authorize the Legislative Council to take “such legal action as it determines appropriate and fiscally feasible,” including but not limited to joining any pending legal action as an intervenor, providing an amicus brief in any pending legal action or initiating new litigation.
The Lobstermen’s Association lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., takes aim at a biological opinion published by the National Marine Fisheries Service in May. The fisheries service is named as a defendant along with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and fisheries service Assistant Administrator for Fisheries Janet Coit.
It argues the restrictions are based on flawed science, pose an existential threat to Maine’s lobster industry and will not shield whales from extinction.
If successful, the lawsuit would require the Marine Fisheries Service to reassess its biological opinion. The recently created rules would remain in place until new rules are developed with an updated review.
Another lawsuit filed Monday by the Maine Lobster Union, Fox Island Lobster Co. and Damon Family Lobster Co. aims to stop enforcement of the October-to-January seasonal closure.
Fisheries regulators created the seasonally restricted area in order to spread risk responsibility across multiple jurisdictions even though lobstering is far more important to Maine than to nearby states, the companies said in their legal complaint.
Moreover, right whale sightings in the area are extremely rare, and regulators did not evaluate the efficacy of existing regulations to prevent death and injury to whales, the complaint alleges.
The companies are seeking injunctive relief to pause the closure and get a final rule revision.
State Rep. Genevieve McDonald, D-Stonington, a lobster boat captain, said in a statement she fully supports taking “every possible action” to protect the lobster fishery from what she sees as unfair and arbitrary restrictions.
“We should not be basing regulations on outdated science, especially when the livelihoods of so many people hang in the balance,” she said.
The Maine Department of Marine Resources, which opposes the federal restrictions, told legislators this month it would not sue over the new rules, but would join the ongoing 2018 conservation case in order to assist in the effort against the plaintiffs.
Gov. Janet Mills issued a statement Monday saying Maine has been granted “intervenor” status in the case. An intervenor is neither a plaintiff nor a defendant, but is recognized by the court as having an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Only about 360 North Atlantic right whales remain, and the federal plan calls for a 98% risk reduction of serious injury and mortality in the coming decade.
Since 2017, 34 right whales have been killed, according to NOAA. An earlier estimate of 33 deaths attributed 21 to Canada and 12 to the United States.
Eleven incidents were attributed to ship strikes, including at least two in U.S. waters, but none that can be linked to the Maine lobster industry.
The most recent known Maine entanglement occurred in 2004, but the whale survived.

Texto completo: Maranacook, Maine Central Institute in running in KVAC B; Messalonskee, Brunswick among KVAC A favorites.
Ryan Meserve has a good problem on his hands.
Whereas many high school golf teams hope to lean on two or three talented golfers every year, the Maranacook golf coach has enviable depth for countable spots in the lineup.
“I’ve been really lucky this year, and I think this is what’s helped us kind of weather what every team goes through, which is ups and downs,” Meserve said. “I have seven solid players that I could put in any spot.”
Until a 6.5-2.5 loss to Cony on Sept. 21 in a tri-match with Erskine Academy, the Black Bears had been enjoying an undefeated regular season.
Maranacook is one of three teams — along with Leavitt and Maine Central Institute — vying for a victory at the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference Class B Shootout on Thursday at the Rockland Golf Club. The KVAC A Shootout will also take place Thursday, at the Brunswick Golf Club. Brunswick, Messalonskee, Edward Little and Hampden Academy will compete for the KVAC A Shootout crown.
The KVAC Shootout victors will be crowned conference champions.
“I’ve been incredibly happy,” Meserve said. “They’re a real great group of kids, they try really hard. They take to action the stuff that we talk about in practice. They’ve had a really good season and really embrace the role of not just focusing on their own match, but they understand the team concept of it.
“It’s been a good number of years since I’ve been back in the Shootout. This team is nice to have that competitive end of the season aspect, so that’s great.”
Sophomore Wyatt Folsom, whom Meserve said is averaging a 38 score this fall, is the Black Bears’ top golfer.
“He had his best round in the divisional playoffs,” Meserve said. “He shot a 35, even par. Nine straight pars, had a really great round. He was playing (Cony’s Ollie Roderigue), just the week before when Cony gave us our only loss of the season, and those guys at Cony, their home course played really well, so I know the Maranacook team was pretty motivated to see them again (Monday) and finish in the playoffs.”
Freshman James Marr is the team’s No. 2 golfer. Brandon Chilton, Alex Trafton, Ben Jewett, Wyatt Lyons and Trent Murray also contribute for Maranacook.
“(Folsom and No. 1 and Marr at No. 2) has pretty much been the constant all year,” Meserve said. “James is just super steady, (hitting) fairways, greens or just in front and chip up. He’s played really well.”
Meserve said he expects a great challenge at the Shootout from both MCI, which defeated Belfast on Tuesday to reach the event, and Leavitt, another team that had a strong regular season. The Hornets are paced by No. 1 golfer Ruby Haylock, who won last year’s Maine Women’s Amateur.
In KVAC A, Messalonskee (18-1) has enjoyed a strong season. The Eagles cruised past Mt. Blue 9-0 on Tuesday to cement their spot in the Shootout.
“At (18-1), you can’t be disappointed,” coach Gene Dumont said. “The team has played well, they’ve gotten better, if you can get better. We’re strong, we’re deep. I’ve got a lot of choices to start (in the lineup). My top two or three players are very strong. We’re happy to be where we’re at and we’re looking forward to the playoffs.”
Messalonskee’s top golfer is senior Brandon Bearce, a Waterville transfer. The Eagles have also received consistent low scores from Mitch Grant, Sam Seekins, Jude Lilly and Brady Bumford. Dumont said he knew the Eagles would play well this season, but adding Bearce to the mix has provided a spark.
“(Bearce) is a very strong player, he’s our No. 1 now,” Dumont said. “When you have a No. 1 move into a strong, deep team, it just makes it that much stronger.”
Brunswick fought past rival Mt. Ararat on Monday for its place in the Shootout, beating the Eagles by 10 strokes (171-181).
“We were fired up coming into (the Mt. Ararat match),” said Austin Stromick of Brunswick, the low medalist of the match with a 39, after beating Mt. Ararat. “We knew there was more at stake today, so Charlie (Austin) wanted to up our game knowing that we’d have this opportunity.”

Vaccine mandates are the way to fight COVID Data show that immunizations work, but voluntary incentives go only so far.

Texto completo: As of Friday, all health care workers in Maine are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Any who do not comply have to be fired by their employer before enforcement begins Oct. 29.
The rule sounds harsh, and it has drawn vocal opposition by some, including a very small, very vocal minority of health care workers who say they will quit before they comply.
But with new cases and hospitalizations on the rise in Maine, this measure is absolutely necessary. Workers who are in contact with patients who are sick with COVID and people who are frail enough to need direct care in a hospital or nursing home should be vaccinated, and most are.
If we have learned anything in the past nine months, it's that the COVID vaccines are safe and they work. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Nirav Shah, M.D., reported last week that even though there are many more vaccinated adults in the state than unvaccinated ones, 90 percent of the COVID patients in intensive care in Maine were unvaccinated.
He cited a federal CDC study conducted in Los Angeles that found that unvaccinated people were 29 times more likely to be hospitalized than vaccinated ones.
And not only do vaccines work, but vaccine mandates work, too.
Vaccine acceptance is on the rise nationally, and the biggest single reason is fear of getting sick with COVID, according to a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
But evidence is mounting that workplace vaccine mandates help people get over their hesitancy and very few people walk away from their jobs if they are required to be vaccinated. United Airlines was one of the first companies to require vaccines, and it reported last week that 98.5 percent of its employees have been vaccinated. Only 593 employees, fewer than 1 percent of the United's 67,000 employees, face getting fired for refusing to comply.
We are seeing similar levels of compliance in Maine's largest health care organizations. As of mid-September, 66 employees from Northern Light Health, and 58 from MaineHealth have resigned in protest of the vaccine mandate. They represent 0.6 percent of Northern Light's workforce and 0.3 percent of MaineHealth's.
In a tight labor market, those losses are not insignificant, but the hospitals lost more workers to COVID during this pandemic.
Some have criticized President Biden's vaccine mandate, which will affect all federal workers and employers with more than 100 employees, saying that instead of negative consequences, people should be given incentives to choose to be vaccinated. That has been tried, and the rise in hospitalizations shows that it does not work.
The Kaiser survey showed why. The divisions that have become a feature of our politics have infected this public health crisis.
According to the survey, most vaccinated people (77 percent) see people refusing the vaccine as a major cause of the recent surge. Meanwhile, most unvaccinated people (58 percent) say the surge proves that vaccines do not work, even though it is unvaccinated people who are filling the hospitals.
This divide will not be resolved with a debate. People have a right to choose whether they want the vaccine, but they don't have a right to make other people sick.
Requiring vaccines in workplaces is good public health policy with a long history and well-established legal precedents. Other institutions, including schools and prisons, should follow the health care industry and also make vaccines mandatory for employees.

Texto completo: A best-selling Maine author said Wednesday that her father contracted COVID-19 from exposure to an unvaccinated nurse in a Bangor hospital and died there last week following a series of healthcare delays caused by the virus.
Christina Baker Kline, a New York Times bestselling author of eight novels, said COVID-19 isn't the official cause of death for her father, former University of Maine professor William Baker, but the virus contributed to delays in his care and kept him in the hospital longer than was necessary, ultimately leading to his death. He was 83.
"He died in quarantine with COVID with multiple infections that he got in the hospital as the result of COVID-related delays," said Kline, who lives in Southwest Harbor and New York City.
On Tuesday Kline wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post highlighting the strain a surge in cases among the unvaccinated has put on hospitals and gaps in vaccinations among healthcare workers. "(Staff) shortages, I believe, cost my father months and perhaps years of his life," Kline wrote. "By placing the rights of unvaccinated staff, patients and visitors above those of vaccinated patients and their families, hospitals are increasing pain and suffering - and are failing to protect vulnerable people from COVID-related isolation, illness and death."
Suzanne Spruce, a spokeswoman for Northern Light Health, the parent company of Eastern Maine Medical Center, said she could not comment Wednesday on the care of specific patients and could not share the hospital's vaccination policy. She said the systemwide vaccination rate for Northern Light is 92.9 percent.
"As for rehab beds, I can tell you that the challenge is we often can't move people to where they need to be," Spruce said in an email. "If someone goes to our acute rehab and needs to go to long-term care, they can end up staying with us longer because it is difficult to place someone in a facility right now. We manage this as best we can, however this is not a problem that is unique to us - there is a shortage of beds for those who need long-term care and rehab both in Maine and across the nation."
UMaine History professor
Maine is requiring all hospital staff and many other health care workers get vaccinated by Oct. 1, unless they have medical exemptions. The state does not plan to begin enforcing the mandate as a requirement of state healthcare licenses until Oct. 29.
"We remain in full support of Maine's vaccine mandate for healthcare workers and expect to be fully compliant with the state's mandate by the deadline of October 29," Spruce said.
A native of northern Georgia, Baker was the first person in his family to graduate from eighth grade and went to college on a football scholarship. He was planning on becoming a minister but ended up getting a scholarship to study at Cambridge University in England for a summer. A mentor convinced him to stay and he went on to earn his Ph.D. there, his daughter said.
Baker spent more than 30 years as a history professor at UMaine and also served on the Bangor school board. He was married to former Maine House Rep. Christina L. Baker, who died in 2013. Kline, whose bestselling novels include "Orphan Train" and "The Exiles," is one of the William and Christina Baker's four daughters.
"He didn't care about money," Kline said. "He never cared about material things. All he cared about was learning and experiences and helping others."
Baker recently split his time between Aiken, South Carolina, and Southwest Harbor, where his daughters all have homes and live there either year-round or seasonally. Five months ago he fell and broke his hip in South Carolina. He had surgery, but the surgery was unsuccessful and while in Maine this summer his family tried to help him schedule a second partial hip replacement.
complications and Covid-19
Kline said they encountered difficulty trying to schedule a new procedure in either South Carolina or Georgia due to pandemic restrictions on elective surgeries. The family was eventually able to book the surgery at Eastern Maine Medical Center, but Kline said they worried about the spike in COVID cases.
"He had the surgery and it was a success and his vital signs were fine," Kline said. "The surgeon said he would be released within 24 to 48 hours to a rehab facility, but there were no beds available and the time stretched on for weeks."
A bed finally opened up at a rehab facility nearby, but Kline said that option worried the family because the presence of active COVID patients at the facility meant Baker would automatically have to be in quarantine if he were to go there. "We were on the fence about it for a day or two because of the fact he would be going into quarantine indefinitely there," she said.
Baker's stay at the hospital ended up being further delayed, however, after he contracted MRSA, a staph infection common in hospitals. Then, about a week and a half ago, Kline said the family was notified that her father, who was fully vaccinated, would have to quarantine due to an exposure to COVID-19.
She said her sister, Cynthia, was at the hospital with their father when staff came in and said he had been exposed. "She asked the head nurse directly," Kline said. "She said, 'I want to know exactly what happened. Unless you tell me otherwise, I am going to take the fact that it was the nurse who was unvaccinated,' and the head nurse just stared at her and did not answer."
Kline said the hospital was reluctant to confirm that her father's exposure was from an unvaccinated nurse, but "it just became tacitly clear it was an unvaccinated nurse." She said her sister Clara also learned from a different nurse that their father's nurse had been unvaccinated.
'surveillance testing'
Spruce, the Northern Light Health spokeswoman, said that Eastern Maine Medical Center, like other healthcare providers in Maine, has seen instances of patients and staff testing positive for COVID-19 as transmission rates remain high around the state.
"We are currently testing any staff member who is showing symptoms, is known to have been around a COVID-positive individual, or who requires surveillance testing," she said. "Once the state mandate goes into effect, unvaccinated employees will not be able to work unless they have a medical exemption."
Kline said her family understands there are always risks for an older person in a hospital setting, but she believes her father would still be alive if not for the many delays he encountered in trying to get care. And she believes it is irresponsible for hospitals to expose vulnerable patients to unvaccinated staff. "The point is unvaccinated people all along the way have led to my father dying from a surgery that was supposed to be pretty routine," she said.

Texto completo: To say Toy Len Goon was a mold-breaker is a bit of an understatement.
She was the bride of a Portland man, Dogan Goon, who brought her to Maine from her native China in 1921. They had eight children and ran a laundry in Portland.
When Dogan Goon died in 1941, Toy Goon was visited by government officials who wanted her to take welfare benefits, but she refused, according to her daughter, Doris Wong. Goon didn't want to give up her independence, Wong said, and planned to continue to raise her children on her own until they were ready to head to college.
"There was no way that she would ever lose control of her brood," Wong said of her late mother, who died in 1993. "Mother was really an extraordinary woman."
Goon's extraordinariness will be recognized Sunday, when the Chinese and American Friendship Association of Maine unveils a marker at 615 Forest Ave., where she raised her family and ran her laundry.
But the plaque won't be the first honor bestowed upon her. In 1952, Goon was named Maine Mother of the Year, then National Mother of the Year, by American Mothers, an organization founded in the early 1930s by, among others, Sara Delano Roosevelt, mother of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The first mothers of the year were, frankly, the type of women you would expect would to be chosen for an award that was handed out each year at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City - the dean of women at Wesleyan College and the wife of the founder of the Mayo Clinic were among the early choices.
SOMETHING SPECIAL
But then came Goon, nominated by a friend and customer in Portland who saw something special in the woman running the laundry on Forest Avenue - and her children.
Clara Soule "saw how we worked and how we were all good students and my brother was in medical school" and recognized their mother's hand in molding her children, Wong said.
When Goon told her daughter that Soule wanted to nominate her for Maine Mother of the Year, she admitted she was dubious.
But ultimately, Goon told her daughter that she would agree to be nominated.
" 'What are the chances? Just make her (Soule) happy, it will never happen,' " Wong remembers her mother telling her.
The timing argued against a Chinese American getting the honor, said Gary Libby of the Chinese and American Friendship Association of Maine, which promotes Chinese language and culture in the state and provided the plaque that's being unveiled Sunday.
"In 1952, we were fighting the Chinese Communists and the North Koreans in the Korean War," Libby said.
A year when Chinese and Americans were fighting each other in Asia was probably not an auspicious time to give an honor that had largely gone to blue-blood American mothers of European descent.
HONORED IN NEW YORK AND D.C.
But there Goon was in May 1952, getting the award in New York City, being paraded through Chinatown, eating lunch in the Capitol as a guest of the House speaker and meeting Bess Truman at the White House. Later that month, she was honored in Boston and at several events back in Portland.
"Mother was so pleased - and a little intimidated," Wong said.
Portland was good to the Goon family, and vice versa, Wong said, although the couple had to move their home and business several times before they settled into the Forest Avenue location in 1934.
The two had rented business locations and apartments, Wong said, but her mother was secretly squirreling away a dollar here and there each week. Eventually, when they found the three-story building for sale on Forest Avenue, Goon told her husband she had $500 as a down-payment on the $5,000 building. A Portland bank gave them a loan and they were able to buy it.
The first floor held the laundry, the second floor was the Goons' home and the third floor was rented out, Wong said. Initially, the second floor "was all one bedroom" for the big family, she said, and Goon would cook for and feed them on the first floor.
"But as the years went by, it became a real apartment," Wong recalled.
ADAPTING TO HUSBAND'S DEATH
When her husband died, Goon told the children there would have to be some changes to allow them to all stay together. Her oldest son, Carroll, dropped out of Deering High School to help her with the business and then, after a year returned as the other children - Richard, Edward, Albert, Josephine, Arthur, Doris and Janet - became old enough to help out in the laundry after school.
But schoolwork always came first, Wong said.
Carroll's teachers sent him books to help him keep pace with the students in school, and after a year, he returned to Deering High to get his degree, went to Syracuse University on a scholarship and then to Johns Hopkins, where he earned a medical degree. The family is filled with PhDs and engineers and lawyers. Wong became a court reporter and then started her own business in Massachusetts.
Goon left Portland the same year she won the award and moved to Massachusetts, near where her children were beginning to settle.
Wong said she never experienced any racism in Portland and is eager to return for the plaque unveiling this weekend. Her sister, Janet Louie, will join her, but her two other surviving siblings are too old to make the trip, Wong said.
"We never had a problem in Portland - everybody loved us," she said. "Our hearts remain in Portland."

Texto completo: A Rockland man will not serve any additional time in jail for making a false distress call that sent the U.S. Coast Guard on a five-hour search for a sinking vessel last year, but he will be required to pay $17,500 to the federal government in restitution.
Nathan Libby, 32, was arrested in January and pleaded guilty to the federal felony charge in June. His sentencing took place Wednesday on Zoom. He apologized for his actions in a statement he read to the judge, pausing at the places where he had scratched out words and started over.
"I fished my whole life," Libby said. "I know the importance of the Coast Guard. I'm grateful that if I or someone else I know had a dangerous situation while fishing, the Coast Guard is there to respond. I'm not going to make excuses, but I am a different person today."
U.S. District Judge Nancy Torresen sentenced Libby to time served - he spent three nights in jail when he was first arrested - and three years of supervised release. She said the hoax appeared to be motivated by revenge against a fisherman who had fired him because of his substance use, and she emphasized the poor judgment of his actions.
"A false distress call puts the lives of everybody that goes out to rescue you in harm's way," Torresen said. "It also wastes time and money. I think someone with a seafaring background like your own understands that more than most people."
The judge did credit Libby for his recent sobriety, his lack of a serious criminal history and the support of his family. She said she wants him to find a steady job, continue his treatment for substance use disorder and start paying the restitution.
"I think this is not going to be an easy time for you, but I think you're up to the challenges," Torresen said to Libby. "I think your 10 months of sobriety is going to put you on the right course."
The maximum penalty for this conviction was five years in prison. As part of his plea agreement, Libby agreed not to appeal a sentence that was less than 12 months.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Perry had asked the judge for six months of incarceration. He said jail time was necessary to recognize the seriousness of the offense and to deter other people from making hoax calls.
He also pointed to the example of Owen Adair, a Vinalhaven man who similarly pleaded guilty to making a false mayday call. Torresen sentenced him in 2015 to one year in federal prison and one year in a halfway house, and she ordered him to pay $15,000 in restitution. He said Libby also should serve some term of incarceration, even if he deserved a lesser sentence because he did not have a criminal record as Adair did.
"Those in the fishing community in that area understand the havoc of what Mr. Libby did, the seriousness of what he did," Perry said. "We, unfortunately, in Maine get these hoaxes periodically, more often than we would like. The government is concerned that a sentence of time served or supervised release sends the wrong message."
Grainne Dunne, the federal public defender who represented Libby, said he will face the lifelong consequences of a felony conviction, as well as the significant debt in restitution. She described his childhood as unstable in part because of his mother's own addiction, and said he dropped out of school at age 14 to work in fishing. Court documents say his drug use began when a co-worker gave him oxycodone after an injury on a boat, and she said he had struggled with addiction over the decade since.
Dunne said Libby had not used drugs since he was arrested. She also submitted letters to the court from family members who talked about his dedication to his young son and his commitment to his recovery.
"Since the moment of his release, Nate has exhibited a strength and determination to his sobriety that has been truly extraordinary to watch," Dunne said during the hearing.
details of the mayday call
The prosecutor's office filed a summary of evidence they said could be presented at trial. That document says the Coast Guard received a distress call around 6:30 a.m. on Dec. 3, 2020. The caller said there were three people aboard the boat and they were in Spruce Head Harbor.
"Mayday, mayday, mayday," says the voice in an audio recording released by the Coast Guard Sector Northern New England. "We lost our rudder and we're taking on water fast. I just don't have enough pumps to keep up with it."
A marine patrol officer went out in that area with a private vessel to try to find the boat that made the distress call, but found nothing. He returned to the dock and spoke to Libby, who was a dock worker at the neighboring Spruce Head Fisherman's Co-op. He gave the officer a list of boats that had gone out that morning. Another person at the co-op listened to the recording and told the officer that the voice sounded like Libby. Investigators tracked the direction of the signal from the distress call to the co-op office, and surveillance footage showed Libby was there at the time the call was made.
The Coast Guard launched a boat and a helicopter as part of the search. Maine Marine Patrol was also involved. The fake call came just weeks after the Portland-based Emmy Rose sank off the coast of Massachusetts and claimed the lives of four fishermen.
No one from the agencies spoke during the sentencing hearing, but the Coast Guard later released a written statement through the U.S. Attorney's Office.
"I applaud the collaborative efforts of the Department of Justice, Maine Marine Patrol, Rockland Police Department, and the United States Coast Guard in bringing this case to a close and ensuring accountability for Mr. Libby's actions," said Capt. Brian LeFebvre, sector commander of Coast Guard Sector Northern New England. "Hoax calls like the call Mr. Libby placed unnecessarily put our rescue crews at risk, waste resources, and may limit our ability to respond to actual emergencies."

Texto completo: Portland High School and all schools in the Bonny Eagle district will be closed Thursday after threats of violence were made on social media and shared by students.
While school and law enforcement officials don't believe the threats shared on the social media platform SnapChat are credible, the schools are being closed "out of an abundance of caution."
The social media threats are part of a problem that has plagued school districts across the United States for several years.
The short video shared among Bonny Eagle students showed an unidentified person writing on a whiteboard, "I will shoot up the school Thursday, September 30th," said Paul Penna, superintendent of School Administrative District 6.
"This isn't something we're going to play games with," Penna said.
Cumberland County Sheriff's Capt. Donald Foss said classes are canceled Thursday in all schools in SAD 6, which serves the towns of Buxton, Hollis, Limington, Standish and Frye Island.
"The handwritten message did NOT target a specific school or school district and could not be confirmed to have originated at Bonny Eagle High School," Foss said in a written statement Wednesday night.
"At this time, Bonny Eagle school officials and law enforcement do not believe this threat is credible, nor do we believe the threat was written on any schools within the Bonny Eagle School District," Foss said. "School officials and law enforcement continue to work closely on this case to determine the origin of the message."
Foss said all school buildings and grounds in SAD 6 were searched and the "original threat" was not located.
Based on a similar threat, Portland High School students will learn remotely Thursday, while in-school classes will be held as usual in all of the city's other schools, including Deering High School, Casco Bay High School and Portland Arts and Technology High School.
"Other public schools in Portland are not considered at risk and will be open as usual tomorrow," said Tess Nacelewicz, communications coordinator, in a written statement. "We are grateful to the Portland Police Department for their timely help in assessing the threat and continuing to monitor the situation to ensure student, staff and community safety when we return to school on Friday."
While Portland police also have determined the threat does not appear to be credible, all after-school activities are canceled Thursday in all Portland schools.
Shannon Moss, spokesperson for the Maine Department of Public Safety, said Wednesday night that Maine State Police had received no reports of similar threats to other schools in Maine.
Similar social media threats have resulted in school closings, lockdowns and student arrests across the country in recent years, including Arizona, Florida, Tennessee and Minnesota.
Penna expressed frustration over the incident in his district.
"Social media is just killing our society," Penna said. "It makes people live on this edge for no good reason. There is nothing to be gained from doing this."

Texto completo: Should children's mental health, as an issue, be part of our public dialogue? Absolutely! Also, should pre-K and after-school education, as issues, be part of our public dialogue with our elected officials? Also absolutely. How about discussing home rule? Well, maybe. But is the Portland Charter Commission the proper forum to talk about these issues? Absolutely not!
Simply put, the Charter Commission's focus should be on the municipal charter. In Portland and in many cities and towns in Maine, the municipal charter sets up the foundation of our local government. It also delegates power between the branches of government - in this case, between the legislative and the executive - and establishes boundaries and restraints of what the powers that be can and cannot do generally. A municipal charter can also differ from the U.S or even Maine Constitution, which establishes rights, restraints on government power and sheds light on the values citizens should strive to have. A municipal charter boils down to forming a government that should be more simple, direct and aware of the fact that the state and federal constitutions have taken care of the rest.
Charter Commission members not only are discussing the issues that I have mentioned above, but also are not being transparent regarding why these issues are being discussed in the first place. One can argue that these topics were brought forward in the public hearings held earlier this summer. But even then, it remains unclear why these topics are pertinent, given that the commission's mission is much greater than that of any other public-facing body in the city of Portland right now and the commission should understand its mission is centered on reconfiguring the structure of local government. Rest assured if the Charter Commission does not open more communication channels with the public on the items they discuss, I can only imagine the amount of confusion there will be when the Charter Commission completes their work.
A topic that generally does not involve setting up the basic structure of our government - whether it is home rule, mental health in our public schools or an entirely different issue - should be left to our City Council and school board. These individuals are elected and accountable to people year-round. In addition these issues are obviously complex, and decisions on them that may sound like a good idea in the moment may need to be reconsidered. By putting any issues like this into a charter, it handcuffs our City Council and school board from making swift changes to policies.
Also, to voters who are urging the commission to put a particular issue into a document that is hard to revisit: Consider that sometimes constitutional mandates can have financial and legal implications. Let's say the Charter Commission proposes to establish the right to adequate mental health care in Portland Public Schools, and it has been adopted by city voters. Now a future school board is obligated to carry out that established right. If a parent decides to sue because they believe that right has not been enforced or that what is provided is not adequate, a future school board could either face a lawsuit or could have to go back to taxpayers to pay for services at a time where asking taxpayers for more money is not feasible. Also, policymakers' hands are also tied because it may not be able to immediately fix through an ordinance.
The Charter Commission needs to become more narrow in its focus by looking at the structure of our city government and leaving the public policy decisions to the elected officials. To residents of Portland: Pay attention to the Charter Commission discussions going forward and ask yourself whether this is something that should be in the charter. If you do not, it could cost all of us down the road where it hurts, the pocketbook.

Texto completo: Maine added a near-record number of COVID-19 cases on Wednesday even as state health officials noted that other, closely tracked indicators offered "signs of optimism" that the current surge is easing.
The 867 cases reported Wednesday represented the second-largest one-day jump and were exceeded only by the 1,008 cases reported Tuesday for the previous three days. The last time the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 800 cases in a single day was in mid-January during the worst surge of the now 18-month-long pandemic.
No COVID-related deaths were reported Wednesday.
Daily case numbers appear likely to remain high in the coming days as the Maine CDC staff reviews roughly 2,500 positive test results reported to the agency over the past week. While that backlog has no impact on when patients learn of a positive test result - because most are notified immediately by the lab or their doctor - it affects the closely watched daily tally of case numbers.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said 13 additional staff members have been added since last week to the team that reviews positive test results to distinguish new cases from duplicates. Additionally, Shah noted that the number of positive cases arriving daily for vetting ebbed slightly from well over 600 a day last week to about 550 daily as of Wednesday.
But Shah said case numbers are only one metric his team uses "to understand how things are unfolding in real time." Perhaps the best indicator, Shah said, is the positivity rate, which is the percentage of total tests that come back as positive. Maine's seven-day positivity rate dipped to 4.6 percent on Wednesday from 6.1 percent two weeks ago. Maine's testing rate also has increased 19 percent over the past two weeks.
Hospitalizations ticked up from 218 on Tuesday to 225 on Wednesday but are lower than the record 235 patients that were in the hospital with COVID-19 on Saturday. There were 71 people in critical care beds and 31 connected to ventilators on Wednesday.
Always reluctant to give "crystal ball" predictions about the pandemic in Maine, Shah gave a characteristically cautious assessment as he noted "some signs of optimism on the horizon - but there are still a lot of signs of concern."
"When you take all of that together there are some very early, way-too-preliminary, unclear signs that there might be an easing," Shah said during a Wednesday briefing with the media. "But I'm not taking that to the bank yet."
'kind of at a plateau'
Dr. James Jarvis, the COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, which operates Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and other hospitals around the state, also hopes that the delta-driven surge is easing.
"It looks like the state of Maine is kind of at a plateau but at a plateau at one of the highest (levels) of numbers that we have seen during this entire pandemic, including last winter when ... we were hopeful that was going to be the worst that we saw," Jarvis said in a separate briefing with reporters. "I do hope that, as we've seen in other parts of the country, that numbers will start to decrease over the next few weeks. That is a hope and that is not a forecast."
Maine has among the highest vaccination rates in the nation and has consistently reported among the lowest COVID-19 case and death rates throughout the pandemic. Yet the state's seven-day case rate of 271.9 cases per 100,000 residents was the highest in New England on Wednesday and was higher than every other Northeastern and mid-Atlantic state except Delaware, according to the latest data from the U.S. CDC.
The seven-day average of new cases of COVID-19 stood at 559 on Wednesday, up from 456 cases per day for the week ending Sept. 15. The highest-ever seven-day average of just over 600 COVID-19 cases occurred in mid-January, but Maine was averaging just a few dozen cases a day in early July.
To date, the Maine CDC has tracked 89,064 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 since the coronavirus was first detected in the state in March 2020. There have been at least 1,022 deaths linked to COVID-19 in Maine during the pandemic.
3rd most vaccinated state
The latest surge has been driven largely by infections among unvaccinated individuals with the more contagious delta variant, which accounted for 99 percent of all cases in the Maine CDC's most recent report on the genetic sequencing of COVID-19 cases.
As of Tuesday night, 73.6 of all eligible Mainers and 64.8 percent of the state's 1.3 million residents had received the full regimen of doses needed for full inoculation against COVID-19. But vaccination rates vary widely across the state, ranging from more than 85 percent of eligible Cumberland County residents being fully vaccinated to just 60 percent in rural Somerset County.
While there had been roughly 2,700 so-called "breakthrough" infections among fully vaccinated individuals as of Sept. 24, the vast majority of new cases in Maine as well as 65 to 75 percent of all hospitalizations have been among the state's smaller pool of unvaccinated individuals.
Medical studies show that fully vaccinated people are much less likely to require hospitalization or die from COVID-19 than their unvaccinated counterparts. Even so, the number of fully vaccinated individuals requiring hospitalization or critical care has risen in recent days.
As of Tuesday, fully vaccinated individuals accounted for nine of the 31 people in critical care beds at Eastern Maine Medical Center and other intensive care units operated by Northern Light Health. One-third of all COVID-related hospitalizations within Northern Light's network were fully vaccinated patients.
Asked about the serious cases among vaccinated individuals, Shah said numbers fluctuate but that breakthrough cases are inevitable because vaccines help prevent serious illness and death, not necessarily infection. Federal regulators have recommended a third or "booster" shot for people vaccinated with Pfizer because of studies showing that protection from the vaccine may wane over time.
"In a state with only, hypothetically, 10 percent of the population vaccinated, there wouldn't be that many breakthrough cases," Shah said. "We are the third most vaccinated state in the country and, as a result of that, we may see more breakthrough cases."
Jarvis said "the overwhelming majority" of people requiring hospitalization have been unvaccinated even though they account for a minority - roughly 26 percent - of the state's eligible population.
"The vaccine is still clearly the best way out of this pandemic," Jarvis said during the Northern Light news conference.
more than 16,500 boosters
There have been 16,520 additional or "booster" shots administered in Maine, according to state CDC data. Of those, roughly 6,500 have received Pfizer booster shots since federal regulators announced the guidelines last week.
Health care providers and pharmacies in Maine have started scheduling appointments to administer third doses of the Pfizer vaccine to individuals who received it initially and qualify for the booster shots. Those include individuals who are 65 or older, younger people with underlying medical conditions, and people who work in health care, as teachers, in day care facilities, in grocery stores or in other settings with higher risk of occupational exposure to the virus.
Based on federal guidelines, booster shots can be administered to eligible individuals starting six months after their second Pfizer shot. Additionally, federal regulators had previously authorized booster shots for individuals with severely compromised immune systems - such as organ transplant recipients and cancer patients - as long as they were vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna drugs.
Federal regulators are still reviewing the medical data about more widespread booster shots for individuals who received either the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

Texto completo: Palaver Strings, the Portland-based, musician-led chamber orchestra, dives into its eighth season with a concert Friday at the newly reopened Waldo Theatre in Waldoboro and follows it up Nov. 4 at One Longfellow Square in Portland with a collaborative performance with the Warp Trio, which is actually a cross-musical-genre quartet.
Currently with 11 core members and two rotating guest spots, the Palaver Strings ensemble has distinguished itself for its sense of musical adventure and its willingness to tackle a variety of music and perform in any space. This season, the full ensemble and smaller subsets of musicians will perform concerts across Portland - at Mayo Street Arts, the Mechanic's Hall and First Parish Church - and throughout New England, including at the prestigious Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well in New York, performing music by Charles Mingus, Igor Stravinsky and contemporary composer Josh Henderson.
The ensemble began in Boston and many of its members migrated to Maine in recent years when Palaver Strings launched its Portland-based education program, the Palaver Music Center. It provides musical education for very young children, from six weeks to 4 years old, as well as a strings program for pre-K through second grade with a goal of adding a new grade level of instruction each year. There are also community education classes and songwriting collaborations that focus on lullabies for pregnant women and new mothers, and musical stories from LGBTQ communities.
The performance and educational wings are of equal importance to the ensemble, said Matthew Smith, a Biddeford-based cellist who oversees educational programming. The Palaver instructors interact with students and their parents as teachers and performers, helping to ground the ensemble and its musicians in the community while making music accessible to wider audiences.
"For me, it's about having musicians and especially classical musicians who are part of the community in which you live," said Smith, 31, who grew up in Arizona, studied at the Boston Conservatory and moved to Maine with the ensemble. "Part of Palaver mission is to break down the barriers so classical music is perceived as for everyone and not just for a few, and having students come to your concerts is one way to do that."
Elizabeth Moore, who plays viola, said Palaver has evolved with adventure at its artistic core.
"We started out in living rooms and small art galleries, and we've grown. We are still playing in unconventional settings and smaller venues, but we're also playing a lot of larger spaces with very nice acoustics," she said. "We are keeping ourselves very busy. With 11 or 13 co-artistic directors, there are a lot of ideas and a lot of things that people are passionate about."
The mission of the nonprofit organization is to strengthen community through music, Smith said. In addition to sharing teaching duties, musicians also share artistic and administrative leadership, with a goal of reaching new audiences, addressing social justice issues, and giving voice to underrepresented composers in classical music. Palaver performs more than 40 concerts each year while offering music instruction to more than 325 students.
The performance season will include four large-ensemble programs, a three-part chamber series, and an album release tour. The ensemble recorded a CD during the pandemic.
In Waldoboro on Friday, Palaver Strings will perform a program titled "Portraits," exploring where music meets the visual arts with pieces by Stravinsky about the god Apollo, Mingus' "Self-Portrait in Three Colors," and Reena Esmail's "Teen Murti," which melds classical and Indian music while painting a musical landscape. Palaver is partnering with Indigo Arts Alliance and visual artist Pamela Chevez, who will create artwork in dialogue with each piece.
The Nov. 4 concert at One Longfellow Square, "Affirmation," features a new concerto grosso for piano trio, percussion, electronics and strings. Josh Henderson, a member of the Warp Trio, composed the piece, which is inspired by Assata Shakur's poetry.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- The Maine Legislature on Wednesday approved new boundaries for the state's two congressional districts, 151 state House districts and 35 state Senate districts.
Gov. Janet Mills signed the changes into law Wednesday afternoon.
The new lines reflect changes in Maine's population based on data from the 2020 U.S. Census. The state and U.S. constitutions require the boundaries be adjusted every 10 years to reflect population changes and ensure a near-equal number of residents in each district.
In a series of largely perfunctory votes, with little fanfare or debate, the House and then the Senate approved the changes with more than the two-thirds majorities required for the plans to take effect in 2022.
Among the biggest changes is the shifting of Augusta from the state's southern and more compact 1st Congressional District into the more northern, rural and sprawling 2nd District.
Based on the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan Apportionment Commission, the new voting lines shift 23,300 voters from the 1st District to the 2nd to make their populations more equal.
State House and Senate districts were also reshaped to reflect Maine's 2.7 percent population growth over the last 10 years. Much of that growth was in the southern part of the state, leaving the congressional districts unbalanced with 704,211 residents in the 1st District and 658,148 in the 2nd District.
The commission's work, which is usually done over several months, was compressed in 2021 because of a pandemic-related delay in the release of census data. The state constitution requires the process be completed by June 1, but the commission did not have the data needed to redraw the maps until mid-August. A state Supreme Judicial Court ruling in July gave the commission just 45 days to finish the job once it had the data, which meant the Legislature had to approve the plans by Wednesday.
Mills signed all four redistricting bills later Wednesday, making Maine the second state to complete the process behind Oregon, which approved their new maps earlier this week. Mills also lauded the commission and the Legislature for their bipartisan work.
"I applaud Maine's Apportionment Commission, especially its Chair, former Maine Supreme Judicial Court Justice Donald Alexander, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for preparing and approving new maps that fulfill our commitment to making sure Maine people are equally and fairly represented in their government," Mills said in a prepared statement. "To have done so without rancor and partisanship and under a constrained timeline is something Maine people can be proud of."
Only a handful of lawmakers objected to the new maps, including Sen. David Miramant, D-Camden, who said the new Senate map would divide the island communities of Vinalhaven and North Haven, which currently vote in the same district.
Rep. Nicole Grohoski, D-Ellsworth, said she would vote against the new House lines because they split the towns of Trenton and Ellsworth, which are currently together in House District 132, which she represents. Under the new map, Trenton will be included with towns on the Blue Hill peninsula.
Also voting against the new House map was Rep. Benjamin Collings, D-Portland. Collings said the new House districts for Portland cut his current district in half and he couldn't support the new shape. The House still voted overwhelmingly to approve the new map, 110-10.
The maps also shift more legislative seats toward the more populous southern part of the state making House and Senate districts more geographically compact in the south, while making districts in the less-densely populated north larger. The new maps also essentially create a new state Senate district for rural southwestern Maine, a region typically dominated by Republicans.
The new Senate map, which was approved on a vote of 31-0 in the Senate, also shifts northwestern Maine districts eastward, expanding District 18, which includes all of Oxford County, into parts of northern Franklin County, which is currently in District 17. District 17 expands into parts of Somerset County.
Portland will still be represented by three state senators, although only one district will be wholly within city limits while the other two will pick up parts of the city along with Long Island and parts of Westbrook.
Unlike many states, Maine's process is largely protected from gerrymandering - the process of drawing district lines to the advantage of one political party over another - because it requires a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for approval. In many states, the party in majority power is allowed to redraw the lines, often leading to strange carve-outs that give that party political leverage.
In an unusual joint release, leaders of the Legislature's Democratic majority and Republican minority all praised the votes Wednesday and commended the commission for its work.
"It is because we believe Maine people deserve better than partisan fighting and political games when it comes to making sure they have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives," said Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash. "The odds certainly were not in our favor but once again, Maine lawmakers have proven that bipartisanship is alive and well in Augusta." Jackson also served on the commission.
House Minority Leader Kathleen Dillingham, R-Oxford, said Maine stood out nationally because of its fair and cooperative redistricting process. "Gerrymandering isn't something we worry about in Maine," Dillingham said.
House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, said all sides can be proud of the process.
"Sometimes it takes a few weeks and many hours of working out our differences, but the result of the latest apportionment process shows that when all sides sit down and work together, we can arrive at a positive outcome for the people of Maine," said Senate Minority Leader Jeff Timberlake, R-Turner.
Had the Legislature failed to reach two-thirds approval of the new lines, the districts would have been redrawn by the state Supreme Judicial Court.
The Legislature also Wednesday overwhelmingly approved new lines for the county commission districts in all 16 counties.
The first time voters will participate in the newly drawn districts will be during statewide primary voting in June 2022.
Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said she appreciated the bipartisan agreement and the "smooth and swift" process, despite the data delay, which will allow her staff to build the new districts into the state's voting systems by January. "So that candidates and voters next year know which districts they'll be voting and running in," Bellows said. "We're ready to begin our work to ensure that starting in January, candidates can start collecting signatures to get on the 2022 ballot."

Texto completo: The Maine Legislature is threatening to fight the federal government in court over a set of controversial new seasonal restrictions on lobster harvesting in the Gulf of Maine.
Legislators on Wednesday approved a joint order from Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, that would allow the Legislative Council to take legal action in support of Maine lobstermen affected by the regulations.
Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a new set of rules for New England's lobster fishery aimed at reducing the risk to critically endangered North Atlantic right whales and other whale species.
The goal is to reduce the risk to the whales by at least 60 percent in 2022.
The new rules will require lobstermen to string more traps on a single rope and to use weaker ropes to allow entangled whales to break free, among other changes, and will put more than 950 square miles of the Gulf of Maine off limits to traditional lobstering from October through January - the area's most lucrative season.
Lobstermen say the new regulations will be expensive, dangerous, burdensome and impractical, and won't reduce the risk to whales.
"The latest rules imposed by the federal government will do nothing to help the endangered species they were designed to protect while having damning consequences on hardworking Mainers and their families," Jackson said in a statement. "... The Maine Legislature will not sit idly by while this iconic industry is under threat. We are ready to take legal action to right this wrong and support the hardworking men and women in the lobstering industry."
SEASONAL RESTRICTIONS TO BEGIN
Most of the changes required by the rule will go into effect May 1, 2022, which is the start of the American lobster/Jonah crab fishing year, while the most immediate change to impose new, seasonally restricted areas off Maine and Massachusetts will go into effect Oct. 18.
According to federal officials, the closure will directly affect roughly 60 lobstermen who set traps in the restricted area and another 60 who might be affected by the others relocating. The vast majority of lobstermen fish closer to shore and will not be affected, the government said.
For the affected lobster harvesters, officials expect the closure will cost them 5 to 10 percent of their total revenue each year.
However, lobstermen who fish in the area say the estimates are grossly off the mark. They say revenue losses for those affected could be closer to 50 percent.
The plan does allow buoyless or "ropeless" fishing - a new and experimental technology that brings lobster traps to the surface using acoustic signals - but the technology has not been tested in Maine.
The joint order comes just two days after the Maine Lobstermen's Association sued regulators to protect the fishery. The association has more than 1,200 members.
The Legislature's joint order is not legal action in and of itself, but it does authorize the Legislative Council to take "such legal action as it determines appropriate and fiscally feasible," including but not limited to joining any pending legal action as an intervenor, providing an amicus brief in any pending legal action or initiating new litigation.
The Lobstermen's Association suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., takes aim at a biological opinion published by the National Marine Fisheries Service in May. The fisheries service is named as a defendant along with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and fisheries service Assistant Administrator for Fisheries Janet Coit.
It argues that the restrictions are based on flawed science, pose an existential threat to Maine's lobster industry and will not shield whales from extinction.
BIOLOGICAL OPINION UNDER ATTACK
If successful, the lawsuit would require the Marine Fisheries Service to reassess its biological opinion. The recently created rules would remain in place until new ones were developed with an updated review.
Another lawsuit filed Monday by the Maine Lobster Union, Fox Island Lobster Co. and Damon Family Lobster Co. aims to stop enforcement of the October-to-January seasonal closure.
Fisheries regulators created the seasonally restricted area in order to spread risk responsibility across multiple jurisdictions even though lobstering is far more important to Maine than to nearby states, the companies said in their legal complaint.
Moreover, right whale sightings in the area are extremely rare, and regulators did not evaluate the efficacy of existing regulations to prevent death and injury to whales, the complaint alleges.
The companies are seeking injunctive relief to pause the closure and get a final rule revision.
Rep. Genevieve McDonald, D-Stonington, a lobster boat captain, said in a statement that she fully supports taking "every possible action" to protect the lobster fishery from what she sees as unfair and arbitrary restrictions.
"We should not be basing regulations on outdated science, especially when the livelihoods of so many people hang in the balance," she said.
The Maine Department of Marine Resources, which opposes the federal restrictions, told legislators this month that it would not sue over the new rules, but would join the ongoing 2018 conservation case in order to assist in the effort against the plaintiffs.
On Monday, Gov. Janet Mills issued a statement saying Maine has been granted "intervenor" status in the case. An intervenor is neither a plaintiff nor a defendant but is recognized by the court as having an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Only about 360 North Atlantic right whales remain, and the federal plan calls for a 98 percent risk reduction of serious injury and mortality in the coming decade.
Since 2017, 34 right whales have been killed, according to NOAA. An earlier estimate of 33 deaths attributed 21 to Canada and 12 to the United States.
Eleven incidents were attributed to ship strikes, including at least two in U.S. waters, but none that can be linked to the Maine lobster industry. The most recent known Maine entanglement occurred in 2004, but the whale survived.

Apohadion's film fanatic brings experimental taste to Space Greg Jamie is putting his unconventional stamp on the Portland film scene.

Texto completo: A city's cinematic identity is shaped by surprisingly few people. For a big-for-Maine but otherwise medium-sized city like Portland, that movie landscape is in the hands of local movie programmers, event coordinators, and those motivated few others who - to use an inside filmmaking term - give a crap. I call them heroes, and I mean it.
Among that number has always been Greg Jamie, who, as booker and partner at Portland's Apohadion Theater, has always made it part of his mission to keep the Maine film scene that much weirder, more adventurous and all-around more rewarding. (Look for such Apohadion lockdown virtual screening reviews as art-horror-sleaze cult film "Thundercrack!" and the recent documentary about still-battling musical warrior Lydia Lunch.)
And now Jamie has expanded that mission, taking over as the film programmer for Portland's perennially exciting and eclectic performance and art space, Space. Those in the know (and who've read this column over the past decade) know how integral Space has been to the local film scene, largely thanks to the efforts of longtime previous Space film guy, Jon Courtney. Courtney now plies his film fanatic's trade as programmer at PMA Films, with fellow film hero Jamie promising to continue Space's central role in keeping Portland's flickering projector lights going.
"I was doing Apohadian/Space screenings as a partnership, and a bunch of outdoor stuff," Jamie said. "It's been collaborative and exciting." And while Jamie's tenure at Apohadion will continue, he's launching his curatorial vision at Space in a big, bold, and decidedly Space-centric way.
"Anceastralidad y Trance" is a - well, I'll let Jamie describe Space's newly launched website presenting the multifarious works of Mexican art and film group Colectivo los Ingrávidos.
"It's a quintessential art and experimental film portal," Jamie said of the five-months-in-the-making project. "It's an exciting place I like to see Space inhabit, doing something outside the conventional way of presenting film."
And "Anceastralidad y Trance" is certainly that. An intentionally non-linear, immersive cinematic experience, the site (curated by Colectivo los Ingrávados' Almudena Escobar López, and designed by Gaile Pranckunaite and Mindaugas Uba) presents visitors with a stylized Aztec sun stone. Tracing your cursor over the figure reveals enigmatic pictures and hints of what lies a click away, with 40 short films and various texts, all representing an aspect of the collective's cinematic mission. That mission, according to Jamie, is best experienced and explained by the filmmakers themselves through exploration of the site, but the "About" section proposes to take viewers into a "spatiotemporal trance where myth, violence, ancestry, precariousness and extinction, generate multiple speculative and multinaturalist cinematic perspectives." Fair enough.
I've delved into the site for several hours now, and, if not entranced, I've certainly been challenged, entertained and intrigued by what I've discovered. As Jamie says, the journey into his first Space venture is part of the point, noting, "It's doing something outside of the conventional way of presenting film, with the movies leaning heavily on art through the lens of politics as well. It represents a good starting place in my brain."
Plus, since all theatrical plans must take the pandemic into account, Jamie says that the website's intrinsic mystery provides the added impetus for movie-starved but still-wary viewers to find some much-needed entertainment. "Sure, you can ask people to sit and watch 40 films, but that's not the point of the site."
That's a novel way to approach his Space tenure, but Jamie also assures Portland's moviegoing public that Space (in accordance with all sensible COVID guidelines) will be reopening for in-person screenings again - very soon.
Oct. 13 will mark Space's return indoor screenings, Jamie said, excitedly extolling the virtues of director Amalia Ulman's deadpan indie "El Planeta."
"It's got something kind of old-fashioned and contemporary at the same time," he said of the darkly comic tale of a mismatched mother and daughter seeking equally unstable ways of coping with financial disaster. "Think Miranda July and early Jim Jarmusch at the same time."
And don't sleep on The Apohadion, where Jamie promises the return of live screenings around the corner, starting Oct. 15 with the completely bananas cult horror/drama/other that is Andrzej Zulawski's 1981 film "Possession." In a newly restored presentation, the Isabelle Adjani/Sam Neill-starring movie is about a couple with, let's call them "problems," including the fact that Adjani's increasingly unhinged partner may or may not be having sex with/giving birth to something unspeakable.
It's just the sort of movie that Jamie and The Apohadion ensure will never be far from Maine moviegoers' consciousness, and exactly the right film to welcome viewers back. Said Jamie, admiringly, "We were looking to get kind of a statement film," noting that "Possession's" "fun, perverse" thrills are just what pandemic-numbed audiences need. So here's to our local movie heroes like Greg Jamie, who know what we're looking for, even if we don't.
You can experience the mind-expanding puzzle that is "Anceastralidad y Trance" at ancestralidadytrance.space. For tickets, listings and info on the returning-in-full-force roster of films at Space and The Apohadion Theater, check out those fine organizations' respective websites.

FALL AFIELD With more places to stay and stop, it's easier to explore fall foliage in more remote parts of Maine, where forecasters predict brighter colors.

Texto completo: Last year, if you wanted to take a foliage drive, you couldn't be sure you'd find a restroom or a place to eat. Vaccines weren't out yet, and lots of people felt uncomfortable traveling further than an hour from home.
That's not the case this year. Even though COVID-19 cases are still relatively high, most state restrictions were dropped in May and most everything is open. For foliage lovers, that means there aren't really any limits on how far afield you can travel to see Maine's annual showcase of vibrant fall colors. If you want to.
That's a good thing because some foliage forecasters are predicting the humid and hot summer in southern Maine could result in a later and somewhat muted burst of color. Conversely, places in northern Maine, including all of Aroostook County and the state's western mountains, could see a bright but shorter color pop this year, said Ryan Breton, a meteorologist on the TV stations of NewsCenter Maine. In the northern and western parts of the state, it's been a lot dryer, Breton said, and trees "stressed" by a lack of moisture tend to turn colors more quickly and often brighter.
So this may be the year to venture to parts of Maine you might not have visited for your foliage fix. If you're thinking of Aroostook County, go soon, as there could be "high" or "peak" conditions there by this weekend or next week, says Gale Ross, the state's longtime foliage report compiler. The reports come out every Wednesday at MaineFoliage.com, and the Sept. 22 issue had northern Maine already listed as "moderate" in terms of color. The conditions come in from forest rangers all over the state.
Besides letting you know about the colors, the Maine Foliage website also recommends places to see and events happening. You can also find things to do and spots to visit on your foliage jaunts by going to the state tourism site, visitmaine.com.
Here are some suggestions for some places in Maine to see foliage that may be a little more remote than your go-to spots. And some lend themselves to different ways of experiencing the foliage, including biking, hiking or kayaking.
A DRIVE-BY
See the colors from the very top of Maine by driving along the St. John Valley/Fish River National Scenic Byway. It runs for some 129 miles along the border between Maine and Canada, and along Route 11 between Fort Kent and Portage Lake. The western end of the byway is in the small town of Dickey and the east end is in Hamlin, north of Limestone. Between the two, you pass through Allagash, Fort Kent, Frenchville and Van Buren and other towns important in Acadian history and culture. The Fish River portion takes you past Eagle Lake. For more information on driving the byway, including a list of places to stop and things to see, go to visitaroostook.com.
The Old Canada Road National Scenic Byway is another great place to drive along some flashy foliage. The byway follows Route 201 from Solon, north through Jackman to the Canadian border, about 80 miles. There's a rest area called the Attean Overlook near Jackman which provides great picture-taking opportunities. You also drive by Wyman Lake and The Forks, where the Dead and Kennebec rivers meet. For more information, go to oldcanadaroadbyway.org.
TAKE A HIKE
If you want to get out of your car and see Maine's North Woods from the inside, try Aroostook State Park on Echo Lake near Presque Isle. It's Maine's first state park (1939) and includes Quaggy Jo Mountain, shortened from its Native American name of Qua Qua Jo, which roughly means "twin peaked." Some trails are moderate to difficult, like the North Peak Trail, about a half mile up steep terrain. Others are easy, like the 1-mile Ridge Trail that meanders between the peaks. Other trails bring you past flowing springs and wildlife. For more information, including fees and a map, go to maine.gov.dacf/parks and search for Aroostook State Park.
For some hiking in the western mountains, you can try Grafton Notch State Park, north of Bethel. The park has some challenging hiking along the Appalachian Trail, but there are also places along Route 26 in the park where you can stop and see the scenery with little effort. There are short walking paths to Screw Auger Falls, Mother Walker Falls, Moose Cave and the Spruce Meadow Picnic Area. For more information, go to maine.gov.dacf/parks and search for Grafton Notch State Park.
PEDAL OR PADDLE?
The Androscoggin Riverlands State Park in Turner might fall into the category of lesser-known state parks, at least for casual foliage seekers from southern Maine. The 2,600-acre park has 12 miles of river frontage and a boat launch. So you can paddle your along the river against a backdrop of leafy color. There are are several shallow pull-out areas along the river where you can stop, plus there are picnic spots on small islands managed by Brookfield Renewable. For more information go to maine.gov.dacf/parks and search for Androscoggin Riverlands State Park.
One of the classic fall biking spots in Maine is along the historic carriage roads at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island. Forty-five miles of rustic carriage roads were donated by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his family and built between 1913 and 1940. A devoted horseman, Rockefeller wanted some roads through the park to remain car-free. The broken-stone roads meander past hills, cliffs, waterfalls and through the woods. You can spend the day on the carriage roads, then take a drive around the island or enjoy dinner in Bar Harbor. For more information on the carriage roads go to nps.gov/acad and for information on Bar Harbor, go to visitbarharbor.com.

Texto completo: President Joe Biden previously announced his administration is requiring that all employers with at least 100 workers ensure that their workforce is fully vaccinated, or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to regularly produce a negative test result.
The executive director of the Maine Municipal Association, Cathy Conlow said, “Municipalities are making decisions for themselves based off prevalence of the disease in regards to masking and vaccination.”
Most towns will wait for the state Department of Labor to release guidelines before making further decisions, and then will consult with their attorneys, Conlow said.
But the Maine labor department issued a statement on Sept. 17 that says, “The U.S. Department of Labor has informed the Maine Department of Labor that its forthcoming COVID-19 vaccination requirement will apply to public sector employers in Maine, including state, county and local governments and public school systems.”
Canaan Selectman Daniel Harriman said Tuesday that town leaders are aware of the state vaccination requirements but that the Select Board doesn’t intend to change its August vote. He declined to comment further.
A message left with Mills’ press office about any punitive measures the state may impose against towns that don’t comply was not returned Wednesday.
In the adjacent town of Skowhegan, there’s been pushback against the vaccine requirement. But Fire Chief Shawn Howard said at a recent selectmen’s meeting that, “Unfortunately, we have to abide by these laws and we have to follow through with making sure that all of our employees are vaccinated. This may mean that we lose some employees.”

Texto completo: Litchfield Fire & Rescue stands to lose about five of its 22 employees as a result of the vaccine mandate.
challenge Mills, state
Litchfield requests end to vaccine rule for EMS workers

LITCHFIELD — Town officials have asked Gov. Janet Mills to reverse the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers.
In a letter to Mills, Litchfield officials expressed concern the requirement infringes on the philosophical and religious freedoms of health care workers and could lead to employee shortages in EMS agencies across the state.
Originally introduced in August, the mandate required all health care workers to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1. It defined health care workers as anyone working for a hospital, multi-level health care facility, home health agency, nursing facility, residential care facility, state-licensed intermediate care facility, and EMS workers.
Earlier this month, Gov. Mills announced that the deadline would be extended to Oct. 29 in order to give health care workers more time to receive the vaccine. She also said that $146 million in state and federal funding would be provided to nursing facilities, residential care facilities, adult family care homes, and hospitals to help them handle workforce recruitment and retention amid the pandemic.
The packet sent to the governor includes a cover letter from Town Manager Kelly Weissenfels, written statements from Fire Chief Michael Sherman and Gary Parker, chairperson of the Litchfield Board of Selectmen, and a resolution signed and unanimously approved by the selectmen.
In his statement, Sherman said the department stood to lose about a quarter of its roster of 22 as a result of the rule. He said those crew members have ideological objections to the mandate.
The chief clarified that the town is opposed to the mandate itself, but not vaccines in general.
“These things often get painted as a bunch of anti-vaxxers,” Sherman said. “We’re talking about people that are intelligent, people that have had conversations with their doctors. We’re talking about people who give these things a lot of thought and have had numerous vaccines in the past. We’re not talking about a bunch of people opposed to vaccines. We’re opposing a mandate; we’re opposing a forced vaccination.”
Weissenfels shared similar sentiments about the crew in his cover letter to Gov. Janet Mills.
“These are people who willingly drop what they are doing at a moment’s notice to go to the aid of friends and neighbors,” the town manager wrote. “They understand personal sacrifice. For over a year they have operated safely amid the COVID-19 crisis. These are people who are generally in favor of vaccinations, and should not be dismissed.”
A resolution unanimously approved by the board of selectmen was also included in the packet, which stated that the board “urges reversion of the [mandate] and calls on the state to do better in planning and implementation of COVID-19 vaccine-related safety measures.”
As of Monday, a total of eight staff at Litchfield Fire & Rescue are unvaccinated. Of those eight, Sherman said two are planning to receive the vaccine prior to the deadline, and another has received information from his doctor that he is medically exempt. He said it is currently unclear if this exemption will be recognized under the rules of the mandate.
As for how the town will handle the potential loss, Weissenfels said Litchfield would likely increase mutual aid with providers in surrounding communities.
Sherman noted that some members of the department, while they may be opposed to the mandate, are still deciding to get the vaccine.
“They believe it’s more important to remain able to respond to calls and be a part of the department than fighting this,” he said. “That is occurring here. I think it’s important to note that people who are opposed to this are making the choice to go and get it, despite their opposition because they believe it’s the right thing to do.”
Sherman said he has no intention of going against the mandate or resigning in protest. Instead, he plans to follow the law while fighting to have it changed or revoked.
“Even though I strongly oppose this rule, in fact, I passionately oppose this rule, as Chief I have no option but compliance,” he wrote. “Therefore it is the position of this Chief to follow the law to the best of my ability and fight as hard as I can to change it.”
At one point Sherman and Weissenfels were considering a lawsuit against the state, but are no longer pursuing that.
Weissenfels said the town is no longer searching for an attorney after learning that a class-action lawsuit against the mandate, claiming that it violated religious freedom rights, was already moving forward.
The chief said guidance from organizations like the Maine Municipal Association, the Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association, and the EMS board is that they should follow the mandate’s rules.
“Our town’s attorney advised that we follow the guidelines,” he said. “We have received no legal advice to do anything other than follow the guidelines.”
MMA Director Catherine Conlow said that while the organization doesn’t track requests and inquiries concerning the mandate, they have received several from Maine communities.
“If the questions are specific towards legal action against the mandate, we would refer them back to their counsel,” Conlow said.
Sherman said he has spoken with departments in other communities who are also opposed to the mandate. As with Litchfield, these departments also face the potential loss of employees.
“I’ve heard numbers similar to ours,” he said. “Three to four individuals is a pretty common number that these agencies stand to lose.”
Weissenfels said the town office has not received any calls from residents about the issue, but that they have received some responses on their Facebook page after posting about their opposition to the mandate.
“There were no overwhelming opinions in one direction or the other,” he said. “We have a lot of support for our volunteers, that seems to be consistent across the board.”

New boundaries for Legislature, Congress, county commissioners to take effect in 2022

Texto completo: The new districts for the Legislature, Congress and county commissioners will take effect in 2022.

AUGUSTA — The Maine Legislature on Wednesday approved new boundaries for the state’s two congressional districts, 151 state House districts and 35 state Senate districts.
Gov. Janet Mills signed the changes into law Wednesday afternoon.
The new lines reflect changes in Maine’s population based on data from the 2020 U.S. Census. The state and U.S. constitutions require the boundaries be adjusted every 10 years to reflect population changes and ensure a near-equal number of residents in each district.
In a series of largely perfunctory votes, with little fanfare or debate, the House and then the Senate approved the changes with more than the two-thirds majorities required for the plans to take effect in 2022.
Among the biggest changes is the shifting of Augusta from the state’s southern and more compact 1st Congressional District into the northern, rural and sprawling 2nd District.
Based on the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan Apportionment Commission, the new voting lines shift 23,300 voters from the 1st District to the 2nd to make their populations more equal.
State House and Senate districts were also reshaped to reflect Maine’s 2.7% population growth over the last 10 years. Much of that growth was in the southern part of the state, leaving the congressional districts unbalanced with 704,211 residents in the 1st District and 658,148 in the 2nd District.
The commission’s work, which is usually done over several months, was compressed in 2021 because of a pandemic-related delay in the release of census data. The state constitution requires the process be completed by June 1, but the commission did not have the data needed to redraw the maps until mid-August. A state Supreme Judicial Court ruling in July gave the commission just 45 days to finish the job once it had the data, which meant the Legislature had to approve the plans by Wednesday.
Mills signed all four redistricting bills later Wednesday, making Maine the second state to complete the process behind Oregon, which approved its new maps earlier this week. Mills also lauded the commission and the Legislature for their bipartisan work.
“I applaud Maine’s Apportionment Commission, especially its Chair, former Maine Supreme Judicial Court Justice Donald Alexander, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for preparing and approving new maps that fulfill our commitment to making sure Maine people are equally and fairly represented in their government,” Mills said in a prepared statement. “To have done so without rancor and partisanship and under a constrained timeline is something Maine people can be proud of.”
Only a handful of lawmakers objected to the new maps, including Sen. David Miramant, D-Camden, who said the new Senate map would divide the island communities of Vinalhaven and North Haven, which currently vote in the same district.
Rep. Nicole Grohoski, D-Ellsworth, said she would vote against the new House lines because they split the towns of Trenton and Ellsworth, which are currently together in House District 132, which she represents. Under the new map, Trenton will be included with towns on the Blue Hill peninsula.
Also voting against the new House map was Rep. Benjamin Collings, D-Portland. Collings said the new House districts for Portland cut his current district in half and he couldn’t support the new shape. The House still voted overwhelmingly to approve the new map, 110-10.
The maps also shift more legislative seats toward the more populous southern part of the state making House and Senate districts more geographically compact in the south, while making districts in the less-densely populated north larger. The new maps also essentially create a new state Senate district for rural southwestern Maine, a region typically dominated by Republicans.
The new Senate map, which was approved on a vote of 31-0 in the Senate, also shifts northwestern Maine districts eastward, expanding District 18, which includes all of Oxford County, into parts of northern Franklin County, which is currently in District 17. District 17 expands into parts of Somerset County.
Portland will still be represented by three state senators, although only one district will be wholly within city limits while the other two will pick up parts of the city along with Long Island and parts of Westbrook.
Unlike many states, Maine’s process is largely protected from gerrymandering — the process of drawing district lines to the advantage of one political party over another — because it requires a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for approval. In many states, the party in majority power is allowed to redraw the lines, often leading to strange carve-outs that give that party political leverage.
In an unusual joint release, leaders of the Legislature’s Democratic majority and Republican minority all praised the votes Wednesday and commended the commission for its work.
“It is because we believe Maine people deserve better than partisan fighting and political games when it comes to making sure they have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives,” said Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash.
“The odds certainly were not in our favor but once again, Maine lawmakers have proven that bipartisanship is alive and well in Augusta.” Jackson also served on the commission.
House Minority Leader Kathleen Dillingham, R-Oxford, said Maine stood out nationally because of its fair and cooperative redistricting process. “Gerrymandering isn’t something we worry about in Maine,” Dillingham said.
House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, said all sides can be proud of the process.
“Sometimes it takes a few weeks and many hours of working out our differences, but the result of the latest apportionment process shows that when all sides sit down and work together, we can arrive at a positive outcome for the people of Maine,” said Senate Minority Leader Jeff Timberlake, R-Turner.
Had the Legislature failed to reach two-thirds approval of the new lines, the districts would have been redrawn by the state Supreme Judicial Court.
The Legislature also Wednesday overwhelmingly approved new lines for the county commission districts in all 16 counties.
The first time voters will participate in the newly drawn districts will be during statewide primary voting in June 2022.
Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said she appreciated the bipartisan agreement and the “smooth and swift” process, despite the data delay, which will allow her staff to build the new districts into the state’s voting systems by January. “So that candidates and voters next year know which districts they’ll be voting and running in,” Bellows said. “We’re ready to begin our work to ensure that starting in January, candidates can start collecting signatures to get on the 2022 ballot.”

Texto completo: constitution requires the process be completed by June 1, but the commission did not have the data needed to redraw the maps until mid-August. A state Supreme Judicial Court ruling in July gave the commission just 45 days to finish the job once it had the data, which meant the Legislature had to approve the plans by Wednesday.
Mills signed all four redistricting bills later Wednesday, making Maine the second state to complete the process behind Oregon, which approved its new maps earlier this week. Mills also lauded the commission and the Legislature for their bipartisan work.
“I applaud Maine’s Apportionment Commission, especially its Chair, former Maine Supreme Judicial Court Justice Donald Alexander, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for preparing and approving new maps that fulfill our commitment to making sure Maine people are equally and fairly represented in their government,” Mills said in a prepared statement. “To have done so without rancor and partisanship and under a constrained timeline is something Maine people can be proud of.”
Only a handful of lawmakers objected to the new maps, including Sen. David Miramant, D-Camden, who said the new Senate map would divide the island communities of Vinalhaven and North Haven, which currently vote in the same district.
Rep. Nicole Grohoski, D-Ellsworth, said she would vote against the new House lines because they split the towns of Trenton and Ellsworth, which are currently together in House District 132, which she represents. Under the new map, Trenton will be included with towns on the Blue Hill peninsula.
Also voting against the new House map was Rep. Benjamin Collings, D-Portland. Collings said the new House districts for Portland cut his current district in half and he couldn’t support the new shape. The House still voted overwhelmingly to approve the new map, 110-10.
The maps also shift more legislative seats toward the more populous southern part of the state making House and Senate districts more geographically compact in the south, while making districts in the less-densely populated north larger. The new maps also essentially create a new state Senate district for rural southwestern Maine, a region typically dominated by Republicans.
The new Senate map, which was approved on a vote of 31-0 in the Senate, also shifts northwestern Maine districts eastward, expanding District 18, which includes all of Oxford County, into parts of northern Franklin County, which is currently in District 17. District 17 expands into parts of Somerset County.
Portland will still be represented by three state senators, although only one district will be wholly within city limits while the other two will pick up parts of the city along with Long Island and parts of Westbrook.
Unlike many states, Maine’s process is largely protected from gerrymandering — the process of drawing district lines to the advantage of one political party over another — because it requires a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for approval. In many states, the party in majority power is allowed to redraw the lines, often leading to strange carve-outs that give that party political leverage.
In an unusual joint release, leaders of the Legislature’s Democratic majority and Republican minority all praised the votes Wednesday and commended the commission for its work.
“It is because we believe Maine people deserve better than partisan fighting and political games when it comes to making sure they have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives,” said Senate President Troy Jackson, D-Allagash. “The odds certainly were not in our favor but once again, Maine lawmakers have proven that bipartisanship is alive and well in Augusta.” Jackson also served on the commission.
House Minority Leader Kathleen Dillingham, R-Oxford, said Maine stood out nationally because of its fair and cooperative redistricting process. “Gerrymandering isn’t something we worry about in Maine,” Dillingham said.
House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, said all sides can be proud of the process.
“Sometimes it takes a few weeks and many hours of working out our differences, but the result of the latest apportionment process shows that when all sides sit down and work together, we can arrive at a positive outcome for the people of Maine,” said Senate Minority Leader Jeff Timberlake, R-Turner.

Texto completo: The new districts for the Legislature, Congress and county commissioners will take effect in 2022.

AUGUSTA — The Maine Legislature on Wednesday approved new boundaries for the state’s two congressional districts, 151 state House districts and 35 state Senate districts.
Gov. Janet Mills signed the changes into law Wednesday afternoon.
The new lines reflect changes in Maine’s population based on data from the 2020 U.S. Census. The state and U.S. constitutions require the boundaries be adjusted every 10 years to reflect population changes and ensure a near-equal number of residents in each district.
In a series of largely perfunctory votes, with little fanfare or debate, the House and then the Senate approved the changes with more than the two-thirds majorities required for the plans to take effect in 2022.
Among the biggest changes is the shifting of Augusta from the state’s southern and more compact 1st Congressional District into the northern, rural and sprawling 2nd District.
Based on the unanimous recommendation of a bipartisan Apportionment Commission, the new voting lines shift 23,300 voters from the 1st District to the 2nd to make their populations more equal.
State House and Senate districts were also reshaped to reflect Maine’s 2.7% population growth over the last 10 years. Much of that growth was in the southern part of the state, leaving the congressional districts unbalanced with 704,211 residents in the 1st District and 658,148 in the 2nd District.
The commission’s work, which is usually done over several months, was compressed in 2021 because of a pandemic-related delay in the release of census data. The state constitution requires the process be completed by June 1, but the commission did not have the data needed to redraw the maps until mid-August. A state Supreme Judicial Court ruling in July gave the commission just 45 days to finish the job once it had the data, which meant the Legislature had to approve the plans by Wednesday.
Mills signed all four redistricting bills later Wednesday, making Maine the second state to complete the process behind Oregon, which approved its new maps earlier this week. Mills also lauded the commission and the Legislature for their bipartisan work.
“I applaud Maine’s Apportionment Commission, especially its Chair, former Maine Supreme Judicial Court Justice Donald Alexander, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for preparing and approving new maps that fulfill our commitment to making sure Maine people are equally and fairly represented in their government,” Mills said in a prepared statement. “To have done so without rancor and partisanship and under a constrained timeline is something Maine people can be proud of.”

Texto completo: Officials say they don't intend to rescind an August vote that left it up to town employees to decide if they want to be vaccinated.

CANAAN — Officials say they won’t require vaccinations for town employees, including EMS personnel and other emergency workers, despite a state-imposed deadline for all health care workers in Maine to be vaccinated.
The Select Board in August voted to make vaccinations against COVID-19 voluntary for all municipal workers, and town leaders this week said they don’t intend to change their position even though the town could face state sanctions.
Fire Chief Troy Bowden declined to comment this week when contacted by the Morning Sentinel. “I’m not gonna comment on that, I already know what you’re asking,” he said.
The town’s website says the fire department is “actively seeking volunteers,” and town leaders have said they’re concerned that a vaccination mandate would result in people leaving the department.
Gov. Janet Mills announced the requirement for health care workers on Aug. 12. The deadline for vaccination was initially Friday but she announced that the deadline would be extended to Oct. 29 to give health care workers more time to receive a vaccine.
President Joe Biden previously announced his administration is requiring that all employers with at least 100 workers ensure that their workforce is fully vaccinated, or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to regularly produce a negative test result.
The executive director of the Maine Municipal Association, Cathy Conlow said, “Municipalities are making decisions for themselves based off prevalence of the disease in regards to masking and vaccination.”
Most towns will wait for the state Department of Labor to release guidelines before making further decisions, and then will consult with their attorneys, Conlow said.
But the Maine labor department issued a statement on Sept. 17 that says, “The U.S. Department of Labor has informed the Maine Department of Labor that its forthcoming COVID-19 vaccination requirement will apply to public sector employers in Maine, including state, county and local governments and public school systems.”
Canaan Selectman Daniel Harriman said Tuesday that town leaders are aware of the state vaccination requirements but that the Select Board doesn’t intend to change its August vote. He declined to comment further.
A message left with Mills’ press office about any punitive measures the state may impose against towns that don’t comply was not returned Wednesday.
In the adjacent town of Skowhegan, there’s been pushback against the vaccine requirement. But Fire Chief Shawn Howard said at a recent selectmen’s meeting that, “Unfortunately, we have to abide by these laws and we have to follow through with making sure that all of our employees are vaccinated. This may mean that we lose some employees.”

Texto completo: extended to Oct. 29 in order to give health care workers more time to receive the vaccine. She also said that $146 million in state and federal funding would be provided to nursing facilities, residential care facilities, adult family care homes, and hospitals to help them handle workforce recruitment and retention amid the pandemic.
The packet sent to the governor includes a cover letter from Town Manager Kelly Weissenfels, written statements from Fire Chief Michael Sherman and Gary Parker, chairperson of the Litchfield Board of Selectmen, and a resolution signed and unanimously approved by the selectmen.
In his statement, Sherman said the department stood to lose about a quarter of its roster of 22 as a result of the rule. He said those crew members have ideological objections to the mandate.
The chief clarified that the town is opposed to the mandate itself, but not vaccines in general.
“These things often get painted as a bunch of anti-vaxxers,” Sherman said. “We’re talking about people that are intelligent, people that have had conversations with their doctors. We’re talking about people who give these things a lot of thought and have had numerous vaccines in the past. We’re not talking about a bunch of people opposed to vaccines. We’re opposing a mandate; we’re opposing a forced vaccination.”
Weissenfels shared similar sentiments about the crew in his cover letter to Gov. Janet Mills.
“These are people who willingly drop what they are doing at a moment’s notice to go to the aid of friends and neighbors,” the town manager wrote. “They understand personal sacrifice. For over a year they have operated safely amid the COVID-19 crisis. These are people who are generally in favor of vaccinations, and should not be dismissed.”
A resolution unanimously approved by the board of selectmen was also included in the packet, which stated that the board “urges reversion of the [mandate] and calls on the state to do better in planning and implementation of COVID-19 vaccine-related safety measures.”
As of Monday, a total of eight staff at Litchfield Fire & Rescue are unvaccinated. Of those eight, Sherman said two are planning to receive the vaccine prior to the deadline, and another has received information from his doctor that he is medically exempt. He said it is currently unclear if this exemption will be recognized under the rules of the mandate.
As for how the town will handle the potential loss, Weissenfels said Litchfield would likely increase mutual aid with providers in surrounding communities.
Sherman noted that some members of the department, while they may be opposed to the mandate, are still deciding to get the vaccine.
“They believe it’s more important to remain able to respond to calls and be a part of the department than fighting this,” he said. “That is occurring here. I think it’s important to note that people who are opposed to this are making the choice to go and get it, despite their opposition because they believe it’s the right thing to do.”
Sherman said he has no intention of going against the mandate or resigning in protest. Instead, he plans to follow the law while fighting to have it changed or revoked.
“Even though I strongly oppose this rule, in fact, I passionately oppose this rule, as Chief I have no option but compliance,” he wrote. “Therefore it is the position of this Chief to follow the law to the best of my ability and fight as hard as I can to change it.”
At one point Sherman and Weissenfels were considering a lawsuit against the state, but are no longer pursuing that.
Weissenfels said the town is no longer searching for an attorney after learning that a class-action lawsuit against the mandate, claiming that it violated religious freedom rights, was already moving forward.
The chief said guidance from organizations like the Maine Municipal Association, the Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association, and the EMS board is that they should follow the mandate’s rules.
“Our town’s attorney advised that we follow the guidelines,” he said. “We have received no legal advice to do anything other than follow the guidelines.”
MMA Director Catherine Conlow said that while the organization doesn’t track requests and inquiries concerning the mandate, they have received several from Maine communities.
“If the questions are specific towards legal action against the mandate, we would refer them back to their counsel,” Conlow said.
Sherman said he has spoken with departments in other communities who are also opposed to the mandate. As with Litchfield, these departments also face the potential loss of employees.
“I’ve heard numbers similar to ours,” he said. “Three to four individuals is a pretty common number that these agencies stand to lose.”
Weissenfels said the town office has not received any calls from residents about the issue, but that they have received some responses on their Facebook page after posting about their opposition to the mandate.
“There were no overwhelming opinions in one direction or the other,” he said. “We have a lot of support for our volunteers, that seems to be consistent across the board.”

Texto completo: David Chipman's defeat was a loss for gun control groups, which saw the appointment of a strong director as the most important move the president could make on guns.
David Chipman's confirmation odyssey began with a short congratulatory buzz from Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in April and ended, he said, with a long, rueful call from the presidential adviser Steve Ricchetti admitting the White House had fallen "short."
Mr. Chipman, a brash gun control activist whose nomination to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives imploded this month, said he had no other contact with the White House, which often left him feeling alone, on "an island," when pro-gun groups attacked him.
Instead, the West Wing strategy focused on selling Mr. Chipman to Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the centrist Democrat and perpetual kingmaker in an evenly divided Senate, only to lose the support of Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, which left Democrats at least one vote short of the 50 needed for confirmation.
"Either this was impossible to win, or the strategy failed," Mr. Chipman told The New York Times in his first public comments since President Biden withdrew the nomination, conceding he could not get the votes. "This was a failure."
Mr. Chipman's defeat represented a major victory for the gun lobby and a huge loss for gun control groups, who saw appointment of a strong director for the bureau as the most important move Mr. Biden could make as Republicans block legislative action. It was a reminder of Mr. Biden's struggles, eight months into his presidency, to fulfill big promises he has made to progressives on voting rights, immigration and guns.
In a far-ranging interview, Mr. Chipman, who served as an agent at the bureau for 25 years before becoming one of the country's most prominent gun control activists, praised the White House for what he jokingly called the "gangster move" of nominating someone like him in the first place.
But he questioned the administration's willingness to execute a coordinated strategy to get him through the Senate and expressed concern about its next moves. He said he found it "unusual" that he spoke to no one at the White House from the moment he was nominated.
"In the back of my mind, I always thought that there would be a Plan B, but so far there hasn't been," Mr. Chipman said.
White House officials pushed back on the suggestion that they are stalled, saying they are considering several possible nominees and pointing to new gun control, community engagement and anti-crime initiatives Mr. Biden outlined earlier this year.
"We know this work is going to be difficult -- especially with Republicans on Capitol Hill moving in lock-step with the gun industry -- but the president is absolutely committed to pushing both legislation and personnel to combat gun violence," said Michael Gwin, a spokesman for Mr. Biden.
Mr. Chipman, 55, said he was speaking out now in hopes of encouraging Mr. Biden's team to focus on reforming and energizing the long-neglected agency, which has been handcuffed by decades of legislative attacks from the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups.
He prefers to do so from the outside, rejecting a recent offer to serve in the Justice Department. He has returned to his position as an adviser to the organization founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, a survivor of gun violence he described as having more courage than anyone in Washington.
Mr. Chipman placed most of the blame for his defeat on the gun lobby, in particular the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group that lobbied Mr. King and others.
And he singled out Lawrence G. Keane, a top executive at the group, for posting a picture on its website showing a federal agent -- falsely identified in a tabloid article as a young Mr. Chipman -- standing in the smoldering debris of the Branch Davidian compound in 1993, which he said prompted a spate of online threats.
"Larry Keane put up a photo of me that he knew was false, trying to get me killed," said Mr. Chipman, who arrived in Waco, Texas, to assist in the investigation long after the A.T.F. had begun an assault that eventually resulted in the deaths of 82 civilians and four federal agents.
Mr. Keane, in a phone interview, called the accusation "categorically false," adding that "the moment we found out that it was in fact not him, we pulled it from our website. If I had known it wasn't him, we would never have used the photograph."
He acknowledged that Mr. Chipman was the subject of death threats, which he called "extremely unfortunate and uncalled-for." But he said Mr. Biden never should have nominated someone as belligerent to gun owners, manufacturers and dealers as Mr. Chipman.
There was, however, one point both men agreed on: The White House, along with Mr. Chipman's small support team at the Justice Department, did not do nearly enough to knock down that story or other accusations against him that circulated widely in conservative media.
Mr. Chipman lauded the dedication of the Justice Department team, but said his attempts to get them to send reporters documents debunking the Waco claim failed -- and he finally had to give journalists the information himself after concluding "no one's defending me."
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said that they quietly countered negative stories about Mr. Chipman, but believed the under-the-radar media strategy was the wisest course.
They said the problem was not Waco, but Mr. King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, who blindsided them by expressing opposition to Mr. Chipman just as the nomination was headed to a floor vote in late June.
A person close to Mr. King said his position should not have come as a surprise to anyone. He had already told administration officials he objected to their sales pitch -- that the A.T.F., an agency he viewed as a neutral regulator, would be the focal point of gun policy under an activist director like Mr. Chipman.
Mr. Chipman got that message in person in July when Mr. King summoned him to his office.
When he arrived, Mr. King told the nominee that Mr. Chipman's father -- a King supporter who lives in Maine -- had sent him a letter urging him to vote for his son.
"At least he likes you," Mr. King quipped.
Then the senator, who had been the subject of an intense lobbying effort by pro-gun groups in his home state, laid out his grievances. According to Mr. Chipman, the senator told him that "my friends who are gun dealers in Maine" objected to the nomination.
Mr. Chipman, who had vowed to intensify inspections of federally licensed gun dealers if confirmed, did not give ground -- and polite calls from Mr. Biden, Ms. Giffords and Thomas Brandon, a former acting director of the agency, over the next few weeks did nothing to budge the senator.
By early September, the White House bowed to the inevitable. Mr. Ricchetti called Mr. Chipman, and spent about 20 minutes expressing regret at all he had been through, as the nominee stood near a field of sunflowers he was visiting with his wife.
Last week, Mr. King explained his position in a letter to constituents, saying Mr. Chipman could not be "a fair and objective regulator" because his association with gun safety groups meant he could not be "evenhanded" with gun dealers.
Mr. Chipman drew another conclusion from the meeting: that Mr. King had been "captured" by the gun lobby, and that his own defeat was a reflection of its enduring power.
"I left his office thinking, 'Does he really believe that people who regulate industries can only get those jobs if they're friends with the industry?"' Mr. Chipman said. "He said the quiet part out loud."

Texto completo: As the executive director of a soup kitchen in Maine, Cherie Merrill is used to getting phone calls from people offering donations. But nothing prepared her for the call she received Sept. 17.
“We got a cold call from someone saying they had a 600-pound tuna, do we want to take it?" she said. “And I never say no to anything. I always say yes."
Then she started thinking about the logistics. “How are you bringing this fish to me?" she asked.
It wasn't long before three 100-quart coolers “full of great big chunks of tuna" arrived at the Belfast Soup Kitchen, she said.
“It was extraordinary," she said.
The bluefin tuna had been caught accidentally by fishermen on a boat in Penobscot Bay, said Captain Matt Talbot of the Maine Marine Patrol. They had been using a net to catch pogies, a type of bait fish, when the giant tuna was trapped in the net. By the time they could retrieve it, the fish was dead, he said.
Talbot said it was clear that the fishermen didn't intend to catch the tuna because it's “a fairly rare occurrence" for a fish that size to be in that area of the bay, and they reported it to authorities right away.
Talbot said the fishermen wanted guidance on how to proceed since they didn't have the proper permits to haul in a bluefin tuna, and asked if they could donate the fish to the Belfast Soup Kitchen.
That was “the best case scenario — not to have that go to waste," Talbot said.
Merrill said the fish yielded 366 pounds of usable meat. The Belfast Soup Kitchen kept half of it and the rest went to a meal delivery program in the neighboring town of Searsport.
Volunteers spent hours cutting and processing the tuna so it could be kitchen-ready. It made its debut on the soup kitchen menu on Tuesday as tuna steak marinated in soy sauce with ginger and garlic, served on a bed of rice with locally grown bok choy. In all, 343 meals were served, she said.
The tuna was a hit, and there's still more to enjoy. Merrill said some will be used in tuna salads and the toro from the belly of the fish will be used in sushi for a fund-raiser dinner in the near future.
“It was delicious. It melted in your mouth. It was the best tuna I've ever had," she said. “People were asking for it today."
Merrill was happy that the accidental catch was able to feed so many.
“If that ever happens again, they know who to call," she said.

TikTok trend ‘devious licks’ hits Maine schools

Texto completo: PARIS — TikTok, the social media network, has renewed interest in old music, made viral video and music stars out of people having fun and even factored into the 2020 presidential election. The free app has been downloaded more than 130 million times in the U.S. alone and established celebrities have started their own accounts.
TikTok is also being blamed for a national trend of school destruction, starting after a student posted a video of personal protective equipment he had lifted with the message “Only a month into school and got this absolute devious lick.” Within a few days that video had more than 7.2 million views and a viral vandalism spree was born.
Maine school districts have not been immune from the acts, as reported in the Portland Press Herald last week. Schools from Old Orchard Beach to Bangor have been dealing with bathroom vandalism all month, with soap dispensers stolen, restroom facility stalls’ destruction and removing fire extinguishers. At Freeport High School some bathrooms have had to be closed and students at Greely High School in Cumberland face suspension and criminal charges.
At School Administrative District 17, Superintendent Monica Henson reports that Oxford Hills schools have not had a big problem with the TikTok challenge.
“We have had three minor incidents,” said Henson last Thursday in an email statement. “Nothing like what’s been reported on the national news, and nothing in the elementary schools.”
Damage and vandalism done during the TikTok challenge would be a violation of Oxford Hills School Districts Student Code of Conduct policy, section eight, which states students shall respect the property of others, including school property and facilities.
Henson added that as of Sept. 23 the challenge has not resulted in any damage to school property. She would not comment on specific situations involving student discipline.
According to USA Today, “Students across the U.S. are being arrested because of their hijinks committed as part of the ‘devious licks’ trend.” The New York Times reports that “TikTok is also trying to stop the trend by deleting the content and redirecting hashtags and search results to its Community Guidelines page, according to a spokesperson.”

LIVERMORE — Step into the past and experience the sights and sounds of the Civil War Era. Hands-on history activities planned for all ages during two days of living history fun at the Norlands.
The Washburn-Norlands Living History Center in Livermore, at 290 Norlands Road, plans to host its Civil War Living History Weekend on Oct. 9 and 10. This family friendly event features a wide variety of demonstrations, exhibits, and engaging activities remembering the activities of the Civil War. It is co-organized by the 3rd Maine Company A and 15th Alabama Company G to benefit Maine’s premier living history farm and museum.
The Norlands is a 400-acre museum and working farm that is the ancestral home of the Washburn family. While no actual battles took place at Norlands, the historic site has a real connection to the Civil War. The Washburns from Livermore were one of the nations’ most influential political families of the 19th century and had a hand in transforming the nation at the time of the Civil War.
Israel Washburn, Jr. was elected as governor of Maine in 1861 and quickly became known as Maine’s little-known giant of the Civil War. He sent more troops per capita than any other northern state. His younger brother Elihu was instrumental in getting Abraham Lincoln elected to the presidency. Samuel served in the U.S. Navy and was Acting Master of the ironclad gunboat, U.S.S. Galena, when it sustained fire on the James River. Samuel was wounded in the hip, an injury that caused him pain the rest of his life.
Their sister Caroline married Freeland Holmes, a doctor from Foxcroft, who volunteered with the 6th Maine Regiment. Freeland died in 1863 leaving Caroline as a widow with two small children. These are just a few examples of how the family influenced and were impacted by the Civil War. Hear more about the Washburn’s remarkable achievements and how the War affected their lives, and those of their Livermore neighbors, during Rally for Norlands.
Union and Confederate military and civilian re-enactors from across New England will be camped on the grounds. Walk through the encampments to experience what life was like for soldiers. Cavalry units are also planning to attend. Living historians will scrimmage with replica weaponry and perform drilling and firing demonstrations. The 6th Maine Battery will fire their Parrott Rifle/cannon. A full-scale battle scenario will be staged each day on the hay fields of the Norlands (2:30 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday).
Throughout the weekend, guests can see blacksmithing demonstrations, tour the 1883 Washburn Memorial Library, and play old-fashioned games. Special Civil War theme lessons will be offered in the one-room schoolhouse. Guests also have the opportunity to try on period clothing in the historic dress-up tent.
The Washburns & Their Neighbors in the Civil War at 1 p.m. Saturday. Several of the Washburn brothers held positions that influenced the War and several of their Livermore neighbors served and lost their lives. In this presentation, Willi Irish, Norlands’ Director of Interpretation and Training, will share original letters, photographs, diary entries and military records that reflect how the War affected life in Livermore.
Visitors are welcome to bring a picnic lunch and enjoy the grounds.
On Saturday, the Jay-Livermore Falls Lions Club will sell hamburgers, hot dogs, and French fries. On Saturday and Sunday, some lunch and snack items will also be for sale, while supplies last.
The event opens at 9 a.m. each day. Tickets will be sold the day of the event or can be purchased online through the Norlands’ website. Members of Norlands enjoy 20% off admission rates. The daily rate is $20 for adults, $10 for children ages 6 to 12 ($16/$8 members), free for children 5 and younger.
Parking is available in the field, across the street from the church. Enter the event at the admission booth located behind the church.
For the safety and comfort of all animals and visitors, there are no dogs or other pets allowed on the property during Rally for Norlands. Service animals are the exception.

Texto completo: <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-26694435" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-140502.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="675" />
Searching for ways to increase Maine’s vaccination rate to help block the spread of COVID-19, public health officials are eyeing an unlikely ally: the state’s children.
People who may not listen to doctors or other experts might be more inclined to listen to their children, according to Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention.
Shah said during his weekly briefing Wednesday that when he was young, he successfully prodded his father into wearing a seat belt at a time when strapping one on was not as common as today.
That same sort of informed nagging might have helped push some parents to cease smoking in the wake of public health campaigns to educate students about the dangers posed by cigarettes.
With seat belts and smoking, Shah said, “kids proved to be very effective messengers.”
Maine’s vaccination rate of 68.4% is third highest in the nation, behind Connecticut and Vermont, and 98.6% of the state’s senior citizens have had at least one dose of a vaccine.
But there are pockets within the state, especially in its most-rural counties, where the rates are lower and the disease is spreading more quickly. Convincing more people to get vaccinated is the best way to prevent more cases, Shah and other experts have said repeatedly.
With 867 new cases reported Wednesday in Maine, the second-highest total since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, officials are eager to find ways to convince more people to roll up their sleeves and get a free, safe shot that will go a long way toward protecting them and others.
Shah said more than 3 billion people worldwide have received vaccinations against the deadly disease, and experience shows it works for almost everyone.
To reach some of the rest, Shah said, it might help to provide information to adolescents and older children, who are already having conversations with parents about the issue.
“We’re still in the how-do-we-think-about-this stage,” Shah said, but conversations are ongoing with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and his colleagues in other states.
“I’m not going to promise this is going to solve it,” Shah said, “but it could add to some of the information that’s out there.”
Spurring the idea, he said, is “the positive experience that we saw equipping adolescents with information about smoking and the deleterious impacts of smoking, as well as with seat belts” during earlier public health campaigns that made a difference.
“What we saw with those two prior efforts, and probably with others, is that parents may not listen to the folks they see on TV, may not even listen to their own doctor,” Shah said, but “it becomes real for them by virtue of having their child bring it to their attention. That registers on a different set of notes.”
Shah said he has spoken with colleagues about ways to use social media to equip 16-year-olds “with ways to have difficult conversations with their parents around getting vaccinated.”
“Some of those 16-year-olds may themselves be facing resistance when they want to get vaccinated,” Shah said, while others “may already have been vaccinated and are now urging their parents to do so.”

Texto completo: REGION — As of Tuesday morning, two schools in School Administrative District have reported COVID-19 outbreaks, Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School in Paris with seven and Guy E. Rowe School in Norway with four.
Exposures at OHCHS are trending down since last week, when the SAD 17 quarantine report listed 13 positive cases there, with 54 students in quarantine. By Sept. 28 only 18 were in quarantine.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-16263322 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/rowe-school-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" />
Rowe, which was the hardest hit of Oxford Hills’ elementary schools during the 2021-2021 year has 53 students and one staff member quarantining this week. On Sept. 23 only two students were quarantined and the school reported one positive case.
The report breaks out quarantine numbers by students and staff as well as confirmed and probable cases. It does not distinguish if the cases reported are students or staff.
One week ago, Oxford Hills Middle School and Oxford Elementary School both had reported outbreaks, of four and eight cases, respectively. The numbers district-wide of cases was 32 and reported quarantines were 156 students and four staff.
As of Sept. 28, 140 students and eight teachers are quarantining due to exposure to the virus, with 22 cases district-wide.
Superintendent Monica Henson said on Monday that she is pleased that the impact of the virus on schools is low, crediting face coverings, social distancing and newly replaced HVAC filters.
“The numbers speak for themselves,” Henson said. “Almost all transmission of the virus has been outside of our schools, where protocols are not as high.”
She said that she knew of only one case where someone was infected by another within their school. Henson also stressed that all students need to be monitored every morning for symptoms such as congestion, sore throat or fever. Any children or staff exhibiting symptoms must stay home.
In Oxford County, people under the age of 29 account for 38.6% of COVID cases, adults between 30 and 59 make up 42.1% and those over the age of 60 19.3%, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control’s online dashboard.
In July Oxford County had 50 reported cases. The number jumped to 188 in August and more than doubled from August to September, with 447 cases reported between Sept. 1 and Sept. 27.

Texto completo: Western Maine has seen a burgeoning electric vehicle scene over the last seven years, with hundreds on the road and a growing EV charging network to serve the community. The annual National Drive Electric Week Solar & EV Expo hosted by the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy has played a big role in this transition, giving potential EV owners the opportunity to test drive a range of cars and learn directly from the people that drive them. This year’s Expo will continue building excitement and educating locals through viewing, riding in, and test driving electric vehicles, riding eBikes, and attending workshops.
Past Expos have included as many as 40 locally owned electric vehicles and e-bikes and hundreds of test drives and rides.
The free event will run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 2, in the parking lot of the Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School, at 256 Main St. in South Paris, as part of National Drive Electric Week. It will include four interactive workshops: Electric Vehicle 101, Solar 101, the Future of EVs in Maine with Efficiency Maine Trust and the Natural Resources Council of Maine, and Community Solar Options. Introductory information on owning and operating an electric vehicle and on switching to solar power will be presented, as well as an update on CEBE’s Community Solar project and information about statewide efforts to support the transition to electric vehicles.
To protect the health of our community members, attendees are required to wear a mask and distance from those not in their family, regardless of vaccination status. In order to test-drive vehicles, individuals will also be required to be vaccinated.
“Maine has an ambitious goal of putting 219,000 EVs on the roads in Maine by 2030 and educational opportunities such as this one are critical to reaching these goals. We know that getting drivers behind the wheel of an EV is one of the best ways to encourage people to choose an EV as their next car. Efficiency Maine is glad to see CEBE and other community groups keeping the momentum behind EVs by providing hands-on experiences with these vehicles,” said Molly Siegel, Program Manager for EV Initiatives at Efficiency Maine Trust, according to a news release.
There are now more than 1.5 million EVs on the road in the United States, and a recent survey by Consumer Reports and the Union of Concerned Scientists showed that more than 60% of prospective car buyers in the U.S. are interested in electric vehicles. There are now more than 40 models available in the U.S., with many of the newer models having a range of 200-300 miles or more.
“Paris Autobarn has been a proud sponsor of the EV Expo for the last five years. Events like the Expo provide a wonderful opportunity for people to get a first-hand experience driving or riding in an electric car. Because of the EV Expo, Paris Autobarn has been able to put more EVs on the road and in the driveways of individuals who may have never even thought about owning an electric car,” said Tony Giambro of Paris Autobarn.
National Drive Electric Week is presented by national organizers Plug In America, the Electric Auto Association, the Sierra Club, and EVHybridNoire. Nissan LEAF® is the exclusive automotive sponsor of NDEW 2021 and Wells Fargo is the exclusive banking sponsor of NDEW 2021. ClipperCreek and Electrify America are silver-level sponsors. Edison International and Enel X are bronze-level sponsors. IBEW 11 is a green-level sponsor.
Additionally, Paris Autobarn, Efficiency Maine Trust, Lee Auto Malls, The Nature Conservancy, Natural Resources Council of Maine, ReVision Energy, and Garbo-Kane are local sponsors of the event. CEBE has also installed 15 EV chargers in the area to help encourage EV adoption as everyday transportation. As in years past, this year’s event will include information on electric cars and eBikes, Maine’s current solar policy, how to get involved in CEBE’s Community Solar project, and the opportunity to interact with actual EV drivers and solar owners. Founded in 2013, the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy works to engage the community in addressing the climate emergency. They organize, educate, take direct action, and implement practical, ecological solutions for a just transition to a thriving, regenerative economy.

NORWAY — Complaints about lack of workers has become a routine drumbeat of advertising, conversation and media reports.
In Oxford Hills, Chamber of Commerce Director John Williams decided to provide a new recruiting tool to small businesses in the region, with the help of Board Member Stan Bennett of Bennett Radio Group. The long-time colleagues are pairing up to bring a radio-based jobs fair to Oxford Hills. The fair launches Oct. 5 at 8:30 on WOXO and will run at the same time every Tuesday as a 15 minute spot.
Williams said he believes this could be the first of its kind job fair, coming out through the radio
“I wandered into the station two weeks ago,” Williams explained during a sit-down conversation at Bennett Radio Group’s Norway studio. “Stan and I were talking about things we’re doing between the station and the Chamber. It occurred to me that with the labor shortage across Maine right now – businesses have lots of openings and trouble filling them. People are reticent to go back to work for any number of reasons. Some of it is COVID-related, some of it is people have gotten….used to being supplemented while unemployed and need to start looking around again. Some people have chosen to move away from the careers or jobs that they had.
“Lots of things are contributing, but I said to Stan that one of the best was I could think to get to word out in our community about what’s available (for jobs) is to do it on the air.”
The two developed a new program to do just that. Every Tuesday morning at 8:30 a.m. they, along with morning co-host Heidi Adam, will present a help wanted broadcast that will be heard WOXO 92.7 in Norway and 100.7 in Rumford. The spot will be rebroadcast on sister station WIGY FM 105.5 and 95.7 on Sundays and will be aired in multiple spots on start-up station The Patriot FM 96.9.
Both Williams and Bennett are in the process of reaching out to small businesses in the WOXO coverage areas inviting them to participate. There will be no charge to be included and it is open to all companies, even if they are not active Chamber members. Business owners and managers should send their job postings directly to Williams at the Chamber of Commerce, either by emailing him at john@oxfordhillsmaine.com or calling the Chamber at 207-743-2281.
“It’s very basic, send us information about the job availabilities you have at your company,” Williams said. “We will literally, on the air, talk about job availabilities in our area, be it Hannaford, the casino, the market up the street. We want to get word out to the community about the jobs that are available.”
Bennett added that the broadcast will feature certain businesses each week.
“We want to show what the Chamber offers to small businesses in Oxford Hills,” he said. “And Bennett Radio stations are here to help the community.”

BETHEL — Music can change people. How? According to penfieldbuildingblocks.org, (a Kohl’s/Penfield Children’s Center project), music can stimulate the brain’s alpha waves which in turn invokes a feeling of peace and tranquility. It also boosts the development of perceptual skills that enhances language.
“Sometimes music helps us to articulate things that we wouldn’t be able to articulate otherwise,” says Crescent Elementary Music Teacher Melissa Birkhold. “As a music teacher, it’s a real privilege to be able to help my students develop this awareness, as well as their ability to express the awareness, and just to develop their creativity in a general sense.”
When asked how music can change a student’s life, Woodstock Elementary School Instrumental Teacher Sarah Safford says music gives the students a place to be grounded. They’re with the same peers for 3-4 years, working towards the same goal together. There is a growth with the same set of people. It can also help in small ways by helping them make connections to music, teaching students work ethic and perseverance by having them go home and practice. It teaches them focus.
The interesting part of being part of an orchestra or band, is the student must be focused on their music notes and how they are playing their instrument, but simultaneously, they must also be focused on what the conductor is doing and each section of the orchestra/band. Students are able to sharpen their focusing abilities from this experience.
Safford says music gives them a chance to belong, it gives them an identity. She adds that kids get so excited to play instruments, it’s the highlight of their day.
Students get the opportunity to try numerous instruments depending on their grade and the class. In Birkhold’s music class, students are taught how to play the recorder, xylophone, and other percussion instruments. They also get to sing.
“They sing a variety of songs, and I incorporate a lot of little stories and games that get them singing,” Birkhold says. “Especially at the younger elementary ages, lessons are heavily movement-based and play-based.
Tapping into their innate capacity to learn through movement and play enables me to develop their rhythmic skills and facilitate opportunities for them to connect to the more expressive qualities of music. Students also learn to read music, and to compose their own music, both individually and collaboratively.”
At Woodstock Elementary, it’s a bit different.
The third, fourth, and fifth graders can choose to play the violin, viola, or the cello. In addition, fourth and fifth graders can play band instruments such as the flute, clarinet, alt. saxophone, trumpet, trombone, or percussion. More so, once they’re in fifth grade, during the recess they have the option to play rock band music on rock n’ roll instruments such as guitar or bass guitar. The school provides the instruments with the instruments it currently has.
Music, unlike language, ignites every part of the brain, including motivation and emotion, according to the Penfield site.
“I’ve seen music enable students to take more ownership of their learning, and become more proactive in seeking out new learning opportunities,” says Birkhold. “I’ve seen students develop confidence in their musical abilities when confidence is sometimes lacking in other areas of their education. I’ve also seen students reach new levels of independence and competence in terms of their ability to engage socially with their peers and with adults.”
According to the National Association for Music Education, “70% of those who were involved in music say that it was at least somewhat influential in contributing to their current level of personal fulfillment.”
“There’s also a strong connection between music and the social/emotional development of young people,” Birkhold says. “The science has been there for a while to show that positive correlation. I think COVID shed a light on what that truly looks like in young people, and why it is so important that we continue to find creative ways to support their social/emotional growth.”

DIFFERENT SPECIES -- Bicknell's thrush. As you ascend a mountain, the habit changes and so do the bird species encountered.
By Bob Duchesne
Now that summer is in full swing, many of us are hiking, biking, paddling and mountain climbing -- you know, all the things I used to do. For those who still stumble up mountains, there is something you should know: The habitat changes as you go uphill, and thus, so do the bird species you'll encounter along the way.
Here's the magic formula: 1,000 feet of elevation gain is the habitat equivalent of moving 300 miles farther north. That means the birds you find near the bottom of Maine's mountains are typical of the birds found throughout the nearby forest.
But the birds near the summit are more typical of those that dominate the landscape hundreds of miles into Canada's boreal forest.
Let's pick a few mountains as examples. Perhaps you're familiar with Mt. Blue near Farmington, Big Moose near Greenville, Big Spencer on the northside of Moosehead Lake or any of a dozen other peaks that stretch to 3,000 feet or higher.
Now let's pick a bird family -- let's say, thrushes. The same phenomenon happens with each mountain.
Typically, the base of the mountain is mostly deciduous, with lots of oaks, maples, birches and beeches. As you ascend, the microclimate becomes cooler and damper. The oaks disappear and the maples dwindle. Hemlocks replace pines. Yellow birch and balsam fir take over from the beeches. Closer to the summit, spruce begins to dominate -- at first tall, but later stunted, dense and impenetrable.
At the bottom of the mountain, wood thrushes are possible, especially around the more southerly Maine peaks. Hermit thrushes and veeries are found everywhere. After a half-hour of climbing, the early thrushes disappear, and Swainson's thrushes begin to take over. The sound of the forest literally changes.
Above 2,800 feet, the forest becomes krummholz -- a German word for stunted, deformed spruce. This is the realm of the rarely seen Bicknell's thrush.
The same thing happens with warblers. The base of the mountain is dominated by birds that prefer mature deciduous trees. Ovenbirds and northern parulas are abundant. Blackburnian warblers, as well as black-throated green and black-throated blue warblers, are common. As you climb, you might notice that the heartier yellow-rumped warblers become more prevalent.
About halfway up the mountain, there is often an area where the hardwoods yield to spruces almost entirely. The remnant birches, beeches and firs on the edge of this zone are scrawny. This is the kind of shorter tree growth that sun-loving warblers desire, and there's usually a bunch of black-and-white warblers, Nashville warblers and American redstarts in this region. Once you're deep into the spruces at the higher altitudes, blackpolls and bay-breasted warblers take over.
Pick any family of birds. Scarlet tanagers and rose-breasted grosbeaks tend to be toward the bottom of the mountain, joined by an abundance of red-eyed vireos. Blue-headed vireos tend to prefer the zone just above them. Most of the flycatcher family is near the bottom, but yellow-bellied flycatchers prefer the summits.
One bird demonstrates the most dramatic example that elevation equals latitude. The American pipit is a tundra-loving bird. Its normal breeding range begins in the upper reaches of Quebec and Labrador, extending northward above the Arctic Circle. But there are two places in New England where they nest: the tablelands atop Katahdin, and the summit of Mt. Washington. Tundra habitat prevails on each.
The good news is, you don't actually have to climb a mountain to see this effect.
There's a noticeable elevation change just driving through Baxter State Park. After you enter the southern gate, the song of hermit thrushes is ever-present. Just beyond Abol Pond, about four miles north, the road winds uphill, and Swainson's thrushes become more common, hermit thrushes less. Bay-breasted warblers and blackpolls begin to appear north of Katahdin Stream Campground. The road gains elevation again north of Nesowadnehunk Fields Campground, and the area becomes dominated by spruce, where these northern warblers become more common.
The other good news is that many of these boreal forest species are also found at lower altitudes, primarily in northern and Down East Maine. Wherever the forest is cool and damp, pockets of spruce-filled habitat flourish. Streams and bogs in the north woods are often surrounded by spruce stands that can go on for miles. Some of them are regenerating from earlier clear-cuts, producing patches of low, dense spruce similar to the krummholz found on mountaintops.
The nice thing about mountain birding is that I now have more excuses to stop and catch my breath.

Texto completo: The state of Maine is launching a new program aimed at helping Mainers with disabilities stay safe. When a person with disabilities or cognitive impairment encounters a law enforcement officer, they can have a difficult time communicating pertinent information. This barrier can create a significant challenge for officers trying to help the individual.
The Contact Person Program will change that. The confidential database would provide law enforcement officers with contact information voluntarily provided by an individual or a legal guardian who signs up for the program.
The Contact Person Program was passed into law in 2019. It was sponsored by Rep. Dan Costain, R-Plymouth, a retired police officer, who saw first-hand the critical need for such a program. "I am very proud to be able to have sponsored this legislation" said Costain.  "Winslow Police Chief Leonard Macdaid and I felt this bill would help many people with disabilities or impairments.  Being a retired police officer there were many times in my career that I would have loved to have this critical information to be able to help citizens. "
The Department of Public Safety developed the database and has implemented the program which will be managed by Maine State Police. "This program will allow officers to quickly gain important information to ensure they can effectively resolve situations involving people with disabilities," said Maine State Police Col. John Cote.
To sign up for the voluntary, free and confidential Contact Person Program simply visit any police department in Maine. The program will go live on Tuesday, June 22.

What shoppers need to know about the plastic bag ban

Texto completo: By Sam Schipani, Bangor Daily News Staff
Grocery shopping in Maine is about to look a little different.
After more than a year of delay, Maine's statewide single-use plastic bag ban will go into effect on July 1.  The Maine Legislature passed a ban on plastic bags in 2019 and it was initially scheduled to go into effect in April 2020. However due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was twice delayed -- first, due to sanitation concerns, and then again due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions on packing supplies.
With the ban comes additional changes including what bags will be available and how much you'll have to pay to get them. What does that mean for shoppers, though? Here's what you need to know.
Which bags count?
After July 1, stores and restaurants will not be allowed to provide single-use plastic bags, which are defined in part by how thick they are.
"The law bans single-use plastic carry-out bags, which includes any thin-film plastic bags less than 4 mils [thousandths of an inch] thick and also requires that paper carry-out bags designed to carry 8 pounds or more contain at least 20 percent post-consumer recycled content," said David Madore, deputy commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Some single-use plastic bags are exempt from the new law, including plastic bags provided by pharmacies for carrying medication, produce bags, deli bags, bakery bags, bags used to wrap flowers or potted plants, garment bags for dry cleaning, bags used for vehicle tires, bags used to carry fish and insects from pet stores and bags used to transport caustic chemicals.
Aside from the exemptions, all carry-out bags made available by a retailer to customers at the point-of-sale must either be a reusable bag (thicker plastic bags meet this requirement) or a recycled paper bag, no matter whether the establishment is a store or restaurant or a temporary food truck or farmers market stand. Additionally, establishments must charge a fee of at least 5-cents per carry-out bag allowed under the new law, both paper and plastic.
"The intent of this language is to ensure that fees are charged for the thicker [plastic bags] that look a lot like the single-use plastic carry-out bags we are all familiar with, but will last much longer due to the thicker film," Madore said. "The fee is meant to encourage people to think of those thick plastic film bags as reusable, and to reuse them to avoid fees for new bags."
Establishments including hunger relief organizations like food pantries and soup kitchens as well as stores with "less than 2 percent of retail sales attributed to the sale of food and less than 10,000 square feet of retail area," are exempt from charging the 5-cent bag fee.
New recycling stations
The bill provides yet another perk for the eco-conscious: Retail establishments that provide exempted single-use plastic bags, such as produce bags, must also serve as a public plastic bag recycling drop-off location.
Municipal recycling programs usually do not accept thin, flexible plastics such as plastic bags and plastic film as the material can clog up machinery used to sort recyclable items. However, plastic bags and film are recyclable.
"The plastic bags and film collected by retailers are not sent to the type of recycling facilities designed to sort our typical residential and commercial recyclables, but are typically combined with the 'back of the house' plastic bags and film such as case overwrap and sent directly to a processor that specifically recycles plastic bags and film," Madore said.
The new recycling stations aren't just for plastic shopping bags, either. You can also put in plastic bubble mailers with the paper label cut out, air pillows that come in packages, bread bags, mattress bags, furniture wrap, case over-wrap found on diapers, toilet paper and similar products, dry cleaning bags, newspaper sleeves, ice bags, pellet bags and more. Thicker plastic bags -- the kind that are permitted by the law and cost five cents apiece -- can also be recycled at the end of their lives (Madore said that they should be able to withstand 75 uses).  
All recyclable plastic bags should be clean, empty and dry when dropped off at these recycling locations. Some plastics require a bit of preparation before being placed in the recycling bin. For example, when recycling wood pellet bags, the top of the bag should be cut off completely, and the bag should be turned inside out and shaken thoroughly to ensure that the bag is empty. Plastic bags used to hold bread or other food items may also need to be shaken out to remove any crumbs. Plastic mailers should have the paper labels cut out, and air pillows should be deflated.
"If needed, a small amount of water may be shaken inside the bag to clean any stubborn material out, then prop the bag open to dry out," Madore said.
Note, though, that any film or bags labeled as compostable, pre-washed salad mix bags, and frozen food bags are not accepted.
What are your options?
Shoppers will now have a choice of paying for available bags or bringing their own reusable bags. It might take a little getting used to though.
Madore said that the new laws are sure to come with their own adjustment period for shoppers, as they work to remember their reusable bags every time they go shopping.
"If you forget your bags and don't want to take any new ones home with you for [five] cents apiece, see if the store has any spare cardboard boxes they might load your groceries in," Madore said. "You can reuse the box or recycle it -- or both."

SOME REEL PEOPLE -- Some Reel People will perform at 10 a.m. on July 8 at Wayside Park in Dexter for the Dexter Age-Friendly Tea Talks.
By Beth Ranagan
The Dexter Age-Friendly Tea Talks is delighted to host the Some Reel People band at Wayside Park at 10 a.m. on Thursday, July 8.
This lively contra-dance band plays frequently in the Maine Highlands area. Venues for contra dance performances over the past decade have included the Garland Grange, the Dexter Universalist-Unitarian Church and Central Hall Commons pre-pandemically. The Central Hall Commons, particularly, provides the large space adequate for an evening of energetic dancing.  Some Reel People also play at Maine country fairs, such as the upcoming Maine Grain Alliance Artesian Bread Fair on July 31 at the Skowhegan Fairgrounds.
At the July Tea Talks event, Some Reel People will not be holding a contra dance for attendees. There will be ample opportunity, though, for people to dance together or alone to the waltzes, polkas, jigs and reels, if moved to do so. The toe-tapping tunes just may bring you up on your feet for enjoyment.
The music and dance forms originated in the 17th century in England and Scotland. They were carried here by our forefathers to their new country where the entertainment was popular until the middle of the 19th century, when couples dancing became more accepted and prevalent than the contra-dance formations done in lines. The contra dance form was rarely expressed through the 20th century until it reappeared with its music during the back-to-the-land movement in the 1970s and became popular once again in New England and, then, elsewhere in the U.S and Canada.
Today, contra-dance participants include adults ages 20 to 80-plus, teens and children. These family-centered events feature no alcohol.  Dances are taught by the caller before each particular dance begins. Assistance is available during the dance by the caller and other experienced dancers who may be dancing with you. You don't need to come with a partner. You will find one, male or female, when you get there.
There are several instruments that you may hear in the Some Reel People contra dance band.  Fiddlers include Donna Burt, Beth McEvoy, Danielle Stanley, Stuart Moore, Hunt Smith, Georgia Prickitt and Jody Richmond. Banjo artists are Toby Hall and Sam Brown, who also plays the mandolin. Allison Smith can be heard on the recorder, penny whistle and keyboard. Val Albertini plays the accordion while Stephanie Reiser is the cellist. Susan Abel keeps the beat with the bass fiddle. The guitarists are Dave Pearson and Roger Noyes. Bev Crockett is the pianist. These enthusiastic and dedicated musicians meet weekly to practice for future gigs.
Come to hear the jigs, reels and waltzes reminiscent of those played and loved by our ancestors in rural settings long ago. The music and dancing created joyful and healthful diversion in their lives. If you decide just to listen, the music will lift your spirits and lighten your mood as you mingle with friends old and new. If you decide to dance, you will find your physical and mental abilities enhanced in positive ways as you stimulate your muscles, lymphatic system, circulation and the cognitive portions of your brain.

Texto completo: Editorial: As overdose deaths continue to rise, Maine needs new tools to save lives
The opportunity to change the trajectory of lives is in school. We should not shelter kids from this harsh reality. Every kid should know that opium and other chemicals will kill you before getting a diploma. If they have the knowledge then they can make an informed decision on if they want to live or not

Column: History lessons should reflect world as it was, not how we'd have liked it to be
Excellent. Knowing American history is a good starting point in coming to terms with race in America.
-- freeman
Thomas Jefferson was known to have wrestled with the concept of slavery, as did many founders. We don't beatify founders; we acknowledge the wisdom of their creations: The Union, the Declaration, the Constitution, all left open the door for future generations to correct the ills of the past which ultimately lead to Civil War. How on earth can you teach the past if you wipe out the names? Two-hundred years from now, should future societies look back on us scornfully, declare us null and void because they will have different standards than we have now? Critical race theory is not a conservative boogeyman; it is a pernicious attempt to divide people. It is the ultimate game of tribalism and holds no place in our educational system
-- MDI1968
Story: What the end of Janet Mills' state of emergency means for Maine
The sub-headline is correct, some things just won't change. The deniers will keep on denying, so the healthcare system will still be in a tenuous situation as these folks who will not take care of themselves or their families and us in danger neighbors the rest of us, will end up at the doctor, the hospital, or worse and heroes of the healthcare system will still extend their service in this war on the pandemic because people just won't do the right thing

Maine counties haven't decided how they'll use a $260M federal funds windfall

Texto completo: By Bill Trotter, Bangor Daily News Staff
Maine counties have started getting installments of the $260 million they are due to receive in federal American Rescue Plan funds, which are meant to help state, county and municipal governments recover from pandemic-related losses and help spur an economic rebound.
But the counties, which typically oversee and fund fewer direct services than their municipal and state counterparts, have not yet decided how they will use the money. Some counties are anticipating almost as much as or more than they spend in a year in American Rescue Plan money.
Many counties are still sorting through federal rules that restrict how they can use the funds, and are waiting to see how other entities such as the state, towns and cities plan to use the separate pots of money that those governments are getting. In some counties, elected officials are planning to hold workshops and solicit feedback from the public on how the money should be spent.
The amounts counties are getting range from $3.2 million for Piscataquis County to $57.3 million for Cumberland County, the state's least and most populous, respectively, according to the National Association of Counties. Other counties getting larger shares of American Rescue Plan funds include York with $40.3 million, Penobscot with $29.5 million, Kennebec with $23.7 million and Androscoggin with $21 million.
The state also is getting federal COVID-19 relief funds, and has identified broadband expansion as one way it intends to use the money. Home internet usage skyrocketed during the pandemic in Maine and elsewhere as many offices closed and had employees telecommute, and because many families either had to or chose to keep their children at home and take classes online.
Hancock County, which is slated to get $10.6 million, already has received about half that amount and has set it aside temporarily as it gathers more information about the relief program.
So far, the county has only reviewed the federal rules governing how they spend the money and hired a consultant to help with interpreting and complying with federal rules, and reporting spending to the federal government, said County Administrator Scott Adkins.
County governments in Maine typically do not offer as many public services as counties in some other states, or as many services as the state or municipalities do.
Maine counties fund and operate sheriff's departments and jails, other services such as probate and deed registries, and also maintain courthouses and provide operational funding to district attorneys' offices. Unlike the state and many municipalities, Maine counties typically do not fund or operate schools, fire departments, water or wastewater facilities, or -- with the exception of more rural counties that include portions of the state's Unorganized Territory -- maintain local bridges or roads.
Penobscot County also has received the first half (roughly $15 million) of its American Rescue Plan funds and plans to send officials to a National Association of Counties conference next month in Maryland to learn more about how the funds can be used. In addition to recovering pandemic-related expenses, possible uses that have come up in discussion include supporting behavioral health programs aimed at cutting down on criminal behavior -- and possibly reducing jail costs -- and upgrading generators that provide electricity to the county's emergency communications system when the power goes out.
Franklin, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Somerset, Waldo and Washington counties all are projected to receive between $5 million and $10 million each. Aroostook and Oxford counties each are projected to get between $11 million and $13 million.
For some counties, the amounts they are getting are similar to or even greater than their entire annual budgets. Penobscot County's annual budget for 2021 is $22.6 million, nearly $7 million less than its expected ARP payment, while Cumberland County's 2020 budget of $59.6 million is only $2.3 million more than the amount it expects to get from the COVID relief program. Hancock County's 2021 budget is $9 million, which is $1.6 million less than its expected American Rescue Plan amount.

Outrage and blame are warranted, but not enough to improve Maine's child welfare system

If you are concerned about a child being neglected or abused, call Maine's 24-hour hotline at 800-452-1999 or 711 to speak with a child protective specialist. Calls may be made anonymously. For more information, visit maine.gov/dhhs/ocfs/cw/reporting_abuse.
A heartbreaking, horrific series of four child deaths has rocked Maine and the communities where they took place.
A 6-week-old infant was allegedly shaken to death in Brewer on May 31, according to prosecutors. A 3-year-old girl from Old Town died on June 6. A child in Temple died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on June 17. And 3-year-old Maddox Williams of Stockton Springs died last weekend.  
These deaths have rightfully been met with outrage, and people have understandably been looking for someone to blame. The push for accountability and consequences is natural and necessary. In three of the cases, with the exception of the death in Temple, a parent has been charged in the deaths of their children.
The alleged actions and abuses should be adjudicated and punished accordingly. There must be personal accountability. There must also be bureaucratic accountability, and societal accountability.
There is still a lot we do not know about these cases, such as whether, or to what extent, state welfare officials were involved before the deaths occured. But we do know some things. Court records show that police had told the Maine Department of Health and Human Services at least twice that Maddox Williams was being neglected, for example.
We expect police investigations, reviews from the Maine Children's Ombudsman and DHHS's own investigations with the help of Casey Family Programs to reveal more information. As the search for answers continues, however, it's not a question of whether the system has failed more Maine children -- it's a question of how it has failed them, and what can be done to prevent future failures.
It's encouraging that the state is bringing in Casey Family Programs, a national organization focused on children's safety and reducing the need for foster care, to help investigate the recent deaths and develop policy recommendations. State officials should give that effort space to be as independent and unvarnished as possible, and then actually act on those recommendations once they materialize.
Just as blame alone won't fix Maine's persistent child welfare problems, neither will defensiveness from state government.
"It's our responsibility as a state and as a society to do everything we can to help children grow up safe and ensure they have the love and attention they need," Todd Landry, director of the Office of Child and Family Services at DHHS, said in a recent press release. "With the expert assistance of Casey Family Programs, we'll learn all we can from these recent deaths and continue our work to protect Maine children and support their families."
Unfortunately, it's no great stretch to say we've been here before as a state. The tragic cases of Marissa Kennedy and Kendall Chick ushered in a wave of scrutiny of Maine's child welfare system in recent years. As a recent BDN headline indicated, that scrutiny has started again after the four deaths in the past month.
This scrutiny cannot be cyclical. Neither can the resources or resolve to make things better for kids across Maine.
It's not enough to dole out outrage and punishment after these tragedies occur, or to be lulled into thinking they are unavoidable because they keep happening. We as a society must commit to providing more resources -- not only to bolster child welfare case work, but to help Maine families before they descend into these nightmare scenarios.
There is a complicated, but not unaddressable, nexus of poverty, mental health and substance use involved in many of these cases. Policymakers cannot ignore the interconnectedness of many of these issues.
Working to address these society-level issues takes time, and doesn't deliver immediate justice in individual cases. It's also much easier to write than it is to do. But it must be part of a multi-faceted, sustained push to improve Maine's child welfare system.

Texto completo: By Kim Brawn, Thompson Free Library
"Things to do in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine for $500, Alex."
July sizzles with fun activities and great programs at this family favorite where can you find your summer vibe, relax on vacation and awaken your mind.
"What is the Thompson Free Library?" That's correct!
If you've wanted to see what TFL's Philosophy Circle is like, come join other curious minds on Friday, July 2 at 3:30 p.m. under the tent. The topic is the Philosophy of Education. "I don't know where the conversation is going to go, but I have readings from ancient Greece to the present," says Library Director Jon Knepp.
Weeds can drive anyone crazy this time of year. We'll try to tame these invasive beasts at "Weed Management 101" on Thursday, July 8 at 1:30 p.m. under the tent. Trisha Smith, from UMaine Cooperative Extension Piscataquis County, will lead an interactive discussion and share tools and techniques for minimizing their impact on garden harvests and landscape aesthetics. Bring questions & samples for identification and advice!
TFL's Reading Group convenes at 6 p.m. on July 8 under the tent to discuss Maine author Greg Brown's debut novel "The Lowering Days." The acclaimed book is an emotionally powerful saga, set in 1980s Maine, that explores family love, the power of myths and storytelling, survival and environmental exploitation, and the ties between cultural identity and the land we live on. Kirkus Reviews calls it "a gripping tale. . . in Brown's hands, the Penobscot region of the 1980s and 90s -- with its eccentric cast of Vietnam veterans, hippy fugitives, gruff lobstermen, and Penobscot tribal members -- comes wonderfully to life." Greg's author talk from March is on YouTube -- well-worth watching!)
Aye, matey! "Capture the Pirate Flag!" sails into TFL's port on Friday, July 9 at 2 p.m. and is open to families with kids of all ages as we build cardboard pirate ships to hide our flags. Water will be the weapon of choice so please dress accordingly!
The beautiful music of the Highlands Classical Chamber Ensemble will echo through the evening of Thursday, July 15 starting at 6:30 p.m. under the tent and beyond as needed. The ensemble's talented musicians: Margery Aumann, piano; Kathy Hunter, flute; Evelyn Marston, flute; Susan Ramsey, violin; Emelia Grant, violin; Evan Viera, piano; and Ruth Fogg, cello. The playlist may include Gershwin, Brahms, Vivaldi, & a Celtic Suite. The concert is free and open to the public.
Kids will love "Wet & Wild Water Play" on Wednesday, July 14 at 10:30 a.m. They'll play water games and just have fun getting wet. Aimed at elementary school age and younger.
Chewonki's "Scales & Tails" brings four live reptiles under the tent on Wednesday, July 21 at 10:30 a.m. The presentation, geared towards children, will cover the characteristics, adaptations and ecology of these often-misunderstood creatures.
Attention history buffs and amateur anthropologists: Maine State Museum Director Bernard Fishman presents "A Story of Maine in 112 Objects" based on his book of the same name on Thursday, July 22 at 6 p.m. The museum selected and photographed 112 artifacts and specimens that, together, tell a sweeping story of the land and its people from prehistoric times to the present. Mammoth tusks, Norse coins, and Joshua Chamberlain's pistol are just a sampling of the objects included.
Wind down with a good book and get school credit. TFL's Teen Book Club meets Friday, July 23 at 2 p.m. Come share your thoughts about any book you've read. This program can be used for FA's reading requirement provided FA rules are followed.
After a long hiatus, "Family Game Night" returns Tuesday, July 27 at 6 p.m. Play ring toss, ladder ball, and more on the library lawn. Tables will be set up for board games under the tent. Ms. Michelle is planning some yummy special snacks too!
Quick reminder: plan a fun family outing to explore the Story Walks at Law Farm and SeDoMoCha Dot Warren Nature Trail.
Finally, get ready for an in-person under the tent "Voices from Home Story Slam" on Friday, July 30 at 6 p.m. with the theme "Encounters." Perhaps a close encounter, a chance encounter, recurring, positive, or negative. Patti Smith once said, "It was an unexpected encounter that slowly altered the course of my life." Have you encountered a person, place, or thing that made your inner compass do a 180? Maybe your encounters have not always been of the earthly kind. Share your 4–8-minute true story in a welcoming, supportive environment. This event is for teens and adults.
TFL's July lineup--and an incredible collection of books and more--will help create the best summer vibes and memorable experiences for all ages.
TFL is open to the public Tuesday to Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Masks are optional indoors for those vaccinated and encouraged for those who are not.

Texto completo: New Hampshire and Maine are very similar in many ways. They are both rural in character, with populations of around 1.3 million people, and both are filled with rugged, hard-working people with a distinct culture.
Yet for all their similarities, Maine and New Hampshire are also different in many ways, most notably in the political culture that has developed in each.
Never has that been on display more than in the period of time surrounding the pandemic, as Gov. Chris Sununu and Gov. Janet Mills -- and their respective legislatures -- have pursued very different approaches to managing the public health challenge presented by COVID-19.
Generally speaking, Sununu and New Hampshire lawmakers favored a lighter touch, and seemed slower to institute restrictions, while insisting on the participation and collaboration of the elected legislature, which returned to work last June.
Maine's instinct, by contrast, seemed to be far more cautious and restrictive on everything from mask wearing, to crowd size limitations, and travel restrictions. And, of course, Maine lawmakers adjourned last March for nearly the whole year, content to allow Mills to run the state via emergency powers.
Those different reactions ultimately stem from the very different philosophies of the people of each state. Where does this difference come from? For my part, I look back to the early 1970s.
In 1971, Maine considered a referendum that asked citizens whether or not they wanted to repeal the income tax, which had been created at the behest of Gov. Ken Curtis in 1969. In the end, voters chose to reject the attempt to repeal it.
In New Hampshire, by contrast, something interesting happened in 1972. That year a little-known politician named Meldrim Thomson was attempting to win a race for New Hampshire governor, and was seeking a way to stand out from the crowd. He decided to try a new approach, making his primary message one of antipathy toward taxes, coining the term "ax the tax" and asking candidates for office to join him in taking a pledge to "practice economy and frugality."
At the time, there were many calling for New Hampshire to adopt an income tax, as Maine had, to raise more revenue for the state and provide more services to citizens. Unlike Maine, however, the anti-tax message caught on and Thomson was able to defeat the incumbent Republican Gov. Walter Peterson in a primary, and then  win the governorship that November.
As New Hampshire grew more economically prosperous, politicians and voters in the Granite State came to see the difference in their state as "The New Hampshire Advantage," and fiercely defended their approach as a selling point for economic development in their state.
This month, though, the differences between the two states grew even more stark as each moved toward passing their respective state budgets.
In Maine, spending continues to grow, while in New Hampshire they have actually cut -- yes cut -- General and Education Trust Fund spending by $172.5 million. New Hampshire also eliminated the tax on interest and dividends, which actually makes the state completely income tax free for the first time. They also cut business tax rates and cut the statewide property tax. In addition New Hampshire pursued major reforms, such as the creation of Education Savings Accounts, which will radically increase choice in education for students and parents.
But most amazingly of all, inside the new New Hampshire budget, lawmakers agreed to language that would grant the state legislature more authority during states of emergency. Legislators have now limited the governor's powers, requiring a session of the Legislature be called after 90 days of an official state of emergency. Once in session, it would be up to lawmakers, not the governor, to uphold or end the emergency declaration.
Maine prides itself on its motto, "the way life should be." I have a suggestion, though, for our neighbors in New Hampshire. Consider a new motto of your own: "The way government should be."

Dismayed by Mills vetoes
Reading the long list of vetoes handed down by Gov. Janet Mills, dismayed, I shake my head, wondering if I'm having a flashback to the Gov. Paul LePage years. We finally get a Legislature that can work out some bills to serve the people of Maine rather than wealthy corporations and our "Democratic" governor vetoes them!
I think Mills' hypocrisy screams out of her veto messages. While she argues in favor of out-of-state corporations and PACs throwing money into our political system, she cannot inure binding arbitration for teachers and other public sector employees because the arbitrator might be "from away."

Protect the right to vote
Following an election that was disputed by former President Trump and his followers, they are now voicing a puzzling series of calls for "reform." Despite their failure to find many courts willing to accept their claims of voter fraud and election rigging, many state legislatures controlled by the Republican Party are now trying to pass laws that they claim will improve the "integrity" of their states' voting systems. But they are doing so in ways that will make it more difficult for most working-class Americans in those states to exercise their right to vote.
To counter this series of partisan efforts at voter suppression, the Democrats in Washington are proposing what seems to be a commonsense reform to bolster our democratic system and shore up ballot access. I believe the For the People Act is an honest effort to increase the political power of average Americans and decrease that of the "dark money" special interest groups that now have a magnified voice in our elections. I am pleased that our Sen. Angus King has shown leadership supporting the For the People Act. I urge Mainers who support truly democratic elections to encourage King in this effort.
They should also join to urge Sen. Susan Collins to show the statesman-like moderation she emphasizes and to support the act as well. Although states' rights are an important needle to thread, this should not be the brush the entire legislation is painted with, and I hope she will see the light.

Collins right to oppose ATF nominee
Sen. Susan Collins recently announced that she will vote against the nomination of David Chipman as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), saying that she found this nomination to be "unusually divisive." I couldn't agree more.
As the executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, I work hard to preserve the rights and freedoms that we all enjoy as Americans. Chipman, on the other hand, serves as a policy advisor for a national group, Giffords, that advocates for extreme gun control measures. In this role, he has been outspoken. If Chipman is confirmed to lead ATF, it will politicize a regulatory and law enforcement agency that depends on compliance to protect the public.
Chipman's nomination is no different than a Republican president putting forward the president of the NRA as a nominee. In both cases, putting forward and confirming a political activist to run a law enforcement agency will do irreparable harm to that already controversial organization.
The Sportsman's Alliance of Maine would like to thank Collins for her thoughtful and reasonable approach to Chipman's nomination. We encourage Sen. Angus King to do the same.

Bangor City Council: 'The only thing not welcome here is hate'

Dan Tremble is the chair of the Bangor City Council. This column was written by the city council: Clare Davitt, Sarah Dubay, Rick Fournier, Susan Hawes, Sarah Nichols, Angela Okafor, Gretchen Schaefer, Jonathan Sprague and Tremble.
As the Bangor City Council, we strive to recognize and celebrate our diversity every day, and in particular during June, marking both Pride Month and Juneteenth. As such, we renounce any efforts to create a "white state" in Maine, particularly in or around the Bangor region.
The recent article by the Bangor Daily News that white nationalists may be considering moving to the Bangor area is disheartening and an affront to the hard-won progress our community has made. As a council, we are bewildered and saddened by this news. While statistically Maine is the whitest state in the country, the City of Bangor encourages and embraces diversity, seeing our growing diversity as an advantage.
The City of Bangor recognizes that this area comprises, in part, the homelands of Indigenous Peoples including the four Tribes of the Wabanaki (Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Micmac, Maliseet), their allies and ancestors. Our community has struggled to reconcile with a history marked with racism and discrimination. Older Mainers or students of history will recall when groups such as the Knights of the Klu Klux Klan engaged in harassment and discrimination of immigrants. In 1984, Charlie Howard, a young gay man, was murdered in Bangor by three youths. This horrific crime left an indelible mark on the conscience of Bangor.
In recent years, the city has supported the LGTBQ+ community in a number of ways. In 2012, the council adopted a resolution in support of marriage equality; in 2013, the city was one of 278 employers that signed an amicus brief challenging the Defense of Marriage Act; in 2014, the city was recognized by Equality Maine for outstanding support of equality; and in 2020, the council added gender identity to non-discrimination policies and prioritized the use of gender-inclusive language in ordinances. This June, the city's support of equality is proudly on display with Pride Progress banners.
Following George Floyd's murder, the council recognized the need to bring more attention to the issues of diversity and inclusion within our community, and to ensure the voices of our BIPOC (black, indigenous, and other people of color) neighbors in all of the work we do. As a result, we created an Advisory Committee on Race, Inclusion, and Human Rights to guide the council on policies, ordinances and programs to support greater diversity and inclusion in Bangor.
In school, we all recited the Pledge of Allegiance with "equality and justice for all." We are truly looking to make changes so those words ring true.
The City of Bangor knows that communities with greater diversity and inclusion do better economically. Diverse communities have greater resources for solving problems and generating new ideas, and immigrant populations in particular tend to be more entrepreneurial. Per the U.S. Census Bureau, close to 40 percent of businesses with employees are owned by women and minorities, and Hispanic-owned businesses represent the  fastest growing businesses in the U.S. Many of these businesses are in high-paying fields such as technology and science.
Just as we have come to see that a vibrant arts community is critical to our economic success, so too is diversity. Attracting and retaining a workforce to support our community is made easier and more compelling when we have an open, welcoming, and intentionally inclusive community. A stronger workforce means stronger businesses and community organizations, more stable property taxes and greater opportunities for all our residents.
As members of the Bangor City Council we soundly reject the idea that Bangor, or any part of Maine is a good place for a "white state." It is our strong belief that Bangor will and must continue to embrace and celebrate diversity. We believe racial justice, equality, inclusion and community support is an ongoing process and as community leaders, we are fully committed to a process that includes more inclusion, not less. There is still much work to be done.
The only thing not welcome here is hate.

Maine Hospice Council awarded grant to improve end-of-life care conversations with patients &#xa0;

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Can lessons from methods used by health officials to consult patients during the COVID crisis be used to improve end-of-life care conversations with patients wherever they live, regardless of their physical access to healthcare? The National POLST and Maine Hospice Council and Center for End-of-Life Care believe the answer is yes. Thanks to a Rita and Alex Hillman Foundation grant the two groups have a chance to prove it.
POLST is many things -- a process, a conversation, and a medical order form for individuals who are seriously ill or have advanced frailty. It is an important part of advance care planning that includes thoughtful discussions between a patient and their provider about their medical condition, treatment options and wishes. It is also a medical order form that travels with you (called a POLST form).
National POLST Executive Director Amy Vandenbroucke, JD described this new project as having two key components: National POLST partnering with the Maine POLST Program, focusing on three rural communities for testing models and working with national partners to conduct surveys and compile successful strategies for legislative change to share.
National POLST and the Maine Hospice Council have a strong working relationship. The new project will rely on Maine's substantive POLST network, including its nurse practitioners, physicians assistants, and the use of telehealth. The goal? Use the Maine findings to develop consistent policies for POLST Programs nationwide to save time, eliminate travel barriers for patients/providers, and enable more people the chance to have high-quality POLST conversations.
The Maine initiative will focus on rural areas with varying levels of POLST utilization: Greater Blue Hill/Ellsworth area (Hancock County), Greenville (Piscataquis County),and Jackman (Somerset County). The two main partner groups will also be working with other partners. The
network of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) serves individuals in some of our most rural areas. And the VA Health Care System has a well-developed tele-medicine infrastructure that offers access for patients in remote areas.
Maine Hospice Council Executive Director Kandyce Powell, MSN, RN said, "The Maine Hospice Council is honored to have been invited to partner with National POLST on this ambitious grant. We are grateful to the Alex and Rita Hillman Foundation for realizing that individuals and families in rural regions deserve the same access to healthcare conversations and services as individuals in more urban areas. The use of telehealth during the pandemic proved to be immeasurably valuable during a time of crisis. One of many lessons learned that may continue to increase access in the future."

Anna Diaz is a member of the board of Maine Inside Out, a nonprofit organization through which facilitators and incarcerated youth collaborate to hold theater programs at Long Creek Youth Development Center. She wrote this column on behalf of the board.
When our young people are incarcerated, removed from their communities and families, it is a wound that is difficult to heal. As members of the board of Maine Inside Out, we all followed different paths to the organization, which holds theater programs at the Long Creek Youth Development Center -- but with the same dedication to transformative justice and in support of youth impacted by the criminal justice system. We are committed to healing the wounds of a carceral system, and we implore lawmakers to do the same.  
Justice for the young people of Maine who experienced the carceral system means listening to their solutions and acting upon them. We know that this practice may feel uncomfortable.  
The idealism of our mission to build a world where everyone matters and belongs took each of us time to connect with. Can we create a world where everyone matters and belongs -- even the people who harm us? Not only do we believe that we can -- but that we must. We can do the work of imagining something better, for all of us, through difficult conversations, acknowledging harm, and working to keep harm from happening again.  
The Maine Legislature could still override Gov. Janet Mills's veto of LD 1668 in order to acknowledge a system that has harmed more than it has helped. The creation of a community center and housing at the site of Long Creek wouldn't erase history, it would give us a place to speak about what was and what can be. A reinvestment of money that once caged children could carry them through the difficulties life throws at all of us and support them in ways we know are possible if we were willing to do things differently.  
LD 1668 does not ask Long Creek to close tomorrow, but in two years. That's two years in which we can thoughtfully implement systems that are not jail cells, but that actually serve the needs of children in crisis.
We recognize that mass incarceration in the United States is a deeply complex problem. However, there are times when the right thing to do also offers a simple solution: This is one of those times. In her veto letter, Mills states that with the closure of Long Creek, "Maine would become the only state in the nation without a secure facility to serve the needs of youth who require detention for some period because they represent a risk to themselves or others."  
The governor and state legislators should imagine standing up in front of the nation and the world and proudly saying: The State of Maine does not put children in jail. Being the only state without youth prisons should be a badge of honor that Maine proudly wears.  
As a board, we welcome the challenge of following where Maine Inside Out's youth lead. It's our job to clear obstacles from their path as they build a better world. We ask the 130th Legislature to do what Mills would not: Show brave leadership to a nation that craves not only acknowledgment of systems of oppression, but repair as well.  
There is a path forward. The passage of LD 1668 could still be a turning point for Maine. Where we bravely lead, others will follow. Maine lawmakers should not let this moment pass. They should commit to real change by overriding the veto of LD 1668.

Maine limits use of 'no-knock' warrants by law enforcement

Texto completo: Maine has become the latest state to restrict the use of "no-knock" warrants by police officers to apprehend criminal suspects.
Legislation signed recently by Gov. Janet Mills will limit the warrants to situations where police or people in a surrounding neighborhood might be at risk of death or bodily harm.
Under the new rules, a judge issuing the warrant will be required to verify the circumstances before, and police executing the warrant will be required to wear body cameras.
Attorney General Aaron Frey told a legislative panel earlier this year that he supports limits on no-knock warrants but doesn't want to see them go away completely.
"The availability of no-knock warrants requires a balance of legitimate risk to the physical safety of others against the inherent risks the execution of no-knock warrants create," he said.
The Maine Chiefs of Police Association noted in recent testimony on the bill that no-knock warrants are rarely used but are necessary in certain circumstances.
"To prohibit their use entirely would likely result in injury or death that might have otherwise been avoided," Edward Tolen, the group's executive director, said recently.
Mills has also signed a similar bill that requires local police agencies to develop a set of standards for the use of warrants to apprehend suspects.
The use of no-knock warrants has come under heightened scrutiny since the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.
Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was shot multiple times by police in March 2020 after they stormed her apartment. The warrant was later determined to be flawed.
Since then, at least five states – including Kentucky – have passed laws restricting or banning the use of no-knock warrants, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Legislation to restrict or ban the use of such warrants has been introduced in dozens of other states, the group said.

Auburn Community Concert Band to resume summer concerts

The Auburn Community Concert Band, under the direction of Milt Simon, will kick off its annual summer series of weekly outdoor evening concerts at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, July 7, at Festival Plaza in downtown Auburn.
The performance is the first of 8 programs scheduled for this Main Street location. The free concerts will continue weekly on Wednesday evenings through Aug. 25 – weather permitting. There will be no rain location this summer. In the case of inclement weather, that evening’s concert will be cancelled, and an announcement will be posted on the band’s website at www.auburncommunityband.com.
“The upcoming concert season marks another return to normalcy,” according to Band Director Milt Simon. Last summer, COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the popular concerts, and marked the first time in 39 years the group was not seen performing each Wednesday evening in downtown Auburn. Last year was still recorded as our 39th season,” Simon stated, “because we held rehearsals starting in early January through mid-March. What made the season memorable, unfortunately, was the forced cancellation of all of our planned concerts.”
With the recent easing of COVID-related safety mandates, the group resumed its rehearsals on May 5th, with 34 out of the earlier 50 participants returning. This season’s volunteer musicians range in age from their mid-teens to their 80s and collectively represent a total of 12 central Maine communities.
Director Simon first organized the band in the Fall of 1981. Simon stated that the organization “gives many individuals a chance to utilize musical talents neglected since their high school days, and the entire community benefits.” He added that the Auburn group is still one of the larger community bands in the state of Maine, and their performances often attract audiences numbering 300 to 400 people.
Each Wednesday evening throughout July and August, the band will present a 75-minute program featuring popular hit songs from the 60’s through the present. Simon predicts that the group’s repertoire of songs will appeal to audiences of all ages. “If you have a favorite song that’s been heard on the radio or in the movies, chances are good that our band will perform it sometime during the upcoming 8-week concert series”, Simon said.
People planning to attend any of the Wednesday evening performances at Festival Plaza should bring their own chair on which to sit, and are advised to arrive well before the 7:00 p.m. concert start time, as large audiences are expected to return this summer. Ample free parking is available in the municipal parking garage located directly across the street from the Plaza.
For more information, visit the band’s web site at www.auburncommunityband.com.

Texto completo: BETHEL — The Stoned Moose, soon to be Bethel’s first recreational marijuana store, got planning board approval last week by a vote of 4-1 with one board member recused.
Members Dwayne Bennett, Jim Bennett, Carolyn Dunn and Meryl Kelly were in favor, with Laurie Winsor opposed and Cherie Thurston recused, because she recently sold property belonging to Mike and Jodi Everett, who will be operating The Stoned Moose.
Mike and Jodi, who already run Moosehead Farms, a medical marijuana store right off Route 2 on the Sunday River Road, are hoping to have the new store open by mid-August.
The Stoned Moose will be on the same property as Moosehead Farms, but in a different building, since state states that recreational and medical marijuana cannot be dispensed from the same building.
Work on the building started this week with the pouring of the foundation. The building will be 320 square feet.
Everett expects to get approved for a retail license at this week’s select board meeting.
The store will have the same address as Moosehead Farms, which is 22 Sunday River Road, Bethel.

One Stop Story Shop
by Tracy Corderoy
I like this book because it’s funny. There is a knight who tries to make a new story by trying different adventures. The knight goes to the moon, the jungle, the ocean, and the Wild West. Silly things happen in each adventure.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Two men wanted in Massachusetts appeared in court Wednesday in Lewiston on charges stemming from a weekend car crash in Revere where a state trooper was intentionally struck, police said.
After the incident, the men reportedly fled to Auburn where they were arrested Tuesday morning at a home.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25216542 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/Luis-Gonzalez-screenshot-250x300.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" />
Andy A. Escarfuller Medina, 22, and Luis Gonzalez, 29, appeared Wednesday afternoon in 8th District Court via videoconference from Androscoggin County Jail in Auburn, each charged with being a fugitive from justice.
Medina, 22, who is wanted on a Massachusetts warrant for child rape, waived extradition to Massachusetts, enabling authorities from that state to take custody of him and return him as soon as possible. He is listed as a transient on jail records.
Luis Gonzalez, 29, of Lynn, challenged probable cause for his arrest.
Deputy District Attorney James Andrews presented a Maine State Police trooper as a witness, who testified that his office had received documentation of a warrant that charged Gonzalez with assault and battery with a deadly weapon, negligent operation, leaving the scene of a personal injury accident and other charges connected to the Saturday crash in Revere.
He said Massachusetts police had also sent a driver’s license photo of Gonzalez along with a physical description, including tattoos.
Judge Susan Driscoll said she found there was probable cause to support the charge of fugitive from justice and believed there was sufficient evidence that the man arrested Tuesday was Gonzalez.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25216623 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/Andy-A.-Escarfuller-Medina-252x300.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="300" />
Defense attorney Paul Corey argued that Gonzalez should be released to the custody of his girlfriend and her mother after posting $800 cash bail.
Andrews argued Gonzalez posed a danger to the community and was a flight risk.
Driscoll agreed.
She ordered both men held without bail at the Auburn jail pending extradition or a bail hearing later this month.
Gonzales had reportedly been driving a vehicle involved in a hit-and-run crash, according to Deputy U.S. Marshal Ryan Guay.
Shortly afterward, Massachusetts State Police found him and the vehicle he had been driving, Guay said.
As police sought to apprehend Gonzales, the vehicle he was driving reportedly crashed head-on into a Massachusetts State Police vehicle. He backed up, then while trying to flee the scene, intentionally struck a trooper who was outside his cruiser, according to Guay.
Escarfuller Medina was apparently a passenger in the vehicle reportedly driven by Gonzales, Guay said.
The Massachusetts State Police Violent Fugitive Apprehension Section, Maine State Police and U.S. Marshals Service developed information that Gonzales had fled to a home in Auburn. U.S. Marshal Service Task Force members arrested Gonzales on Tuesday in a stolen vehicle from Massachusetts and found at the Auburn home.
Escarfuller Medina also was at the home and was arrested.
Both men were taken to Androscoggin County Jail on fugitive from justice charges pending extradition to Massachusetts, according to Guay.

Texto completo: DENMARK — The Denmark Arts Center is to offer a Sensory Music Science Camp from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, July 6, to Friday, July 9, at Bicentennial Park under pavilion and tent, across from the arts center at 50 West Main St.
The camp, for children up to 6 years of age, starts with 317 Main Little Roots music for three days and will support exploration and foster multi-sensory and social emotional learning. Parents are encouraged to attend and participate. The fourth day is taught by Children’s Museum of Maine with a morning of “Wigglers, Fossils, and Whales.”
Sensory Science will have children dive into hands-on learning, discovering what water beads, slow moving slime, flowing fog machines, and honey have in common.
Little Roots is a high-quality, developmentally appropriate, music education curriculum for children, with toddler music sessions incorporating the community’s young families. Parents and caregivers engage in simple songs, rhythms, rhymes, and movement activities. Musical instruments are incorporated to create a playful experience while work with beats and tempo.
CDC guidelines will be followed for all camps.
Register online at denmarkarts.org. The free camp is sponsored by the Charles and Rayma Guarino Fund.
For more information, call 207-452-2412 or visit denmarkarts.org/events.

Texto completo: DEAR SUN SPOTS: A reminder that the Fairbanks Union Church Deacons will host a Yard Sale on July 9 and 10. We would appreciate any items people are willing to donate. We will pick up within a 20-mile radius of Farmington. We do not accept clothing, computers, older model TVs and computers. The proceeds will benefit the Mission and Outreach Program, which gives back to the community. For further information please call Celia at 778-2420 or Elena at 778-4349. — Celia, Farmington
ANSWER: If you live in the area and have appropriate, gently used items to donate, please get in touch with them!
DEAR SUN SPOTS: We want to remind everyone of the Turner Public Library Annual Book Sale Friday through Monday, July 2-5 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. There will be books for sale in a room on the second floor of our building as well as thousands of other books that will cover the tables in the Community Room. Shoppers will find CDs, DVDs and puzzles, as in years past.
On July 4 there will also be a festival with a parade, games, and our world-renowned strawberry shortcake. On the final day, July 5, our sale will end with a festive epilogue; books will be $5 per bag. We will provide paper grocery bags, with no limit on the number of bags customers can fill.
Our library is in the Leavitt Institute Building at 99 Matthews Way in Turner. In addition to being a lively community event, the book sale is an important fundraiser for our library. We hope to see you all there! — Betty, Turner
ANSWER: Libraries all across the state of Maine need your support more than ever this year so please make time to do what you can to support them. This sounds like a wonderful time!
DEAR SUN SPOTS: I’m searching for a recipe for Elderberry Cream Pie. My grandmother used to make it for us but no one in our family seems to have the instructions for it anymore. — Lucille, Minot
ANSWER: You will need to line a 9-inch pie pan with a chilled pie crust. In a large bowl, gently stir together 3 cups elderberries, 1½ cups sour cream, 1½ cups sugar, and ½ cup flour. Bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. This is best served chilled. You can also make a two-crust pie if you prefer.
DEAR SUN SPOTS: In regard to the June 10 story about Italian sandwiches, I moved here from California when I was a small child and had my first ham Italian, complete with the special oil and extra pickles at the Bowdoinham Country Store when it was owned by Ron and Marian Bagley in the 1980s.
Now I’m grown up with kids of my own but now every time I have an Italian, I remember those two people who were so welcoming and sweet to my family and me when we first moved to Maine. — No name, Bowdoin

Texto completo: WATERFORD — The children of Gordon and Virginia Knight of Waterford are asking the Oxford Hills community to help celebrate the couple’s 70th anniversary, which is July 9.
They would love to have as many anniversary cards and well-wishing notes possible sent to their parents at P.O. Box 165, Waterford, ME 04088.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25013403 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/Virginia-and-Gordon-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="915" />
The couple, now in their early 90s, became high school sweethearts while attending Bridgton Academy together, marrying on July 9, 1951. While they courting, Virginia invited Gordon to meet her parents. It may have been nerves, but his future mother-in-law was highly embarrassed when she dropped a grilled cheese sandwich in his lap. Of course he quickly forgave her but the awkward moment became a legendary family memory.
Not long after they married Gordon entered the army. He was assigned to board a ship that would take him to Korea, but the first morning at sea he and his fellow servicemen noticed that the ship was heading in the wrong direction. The captain had been given the wrong orders but followed what he had in hand, steering the ship instead to Europe.
“Every time my father sees a picture of the Eiffel Tower he remembers he was in Paris twice,” said oldest son Richard (Dick) Knight. “And he never got to see the tower in person.”
Hard work is something the Knights grew up doing and continued even past their retirement.
Gordon learned to drive at an early age, running Spillers Express with his father and hauling freight from Portland to the Bridgton area. Virginia helped her parents operate Red Wing Poultry Farm, learning at an early age how to feed and water the flocks and collect, clean and grade eggs for sale. She served as trainer too, teaching her two sisters and brother to care for them as well.
Once married the two continued working as together they raised their four sons, Richard, George, Stephen and Michael.
Gordon spent more than 40 years as the mechanic for A.W. Walker, working on John Deere equipment throughout Oxford county farms and beyond.
“The whole family would get in the car (Dad’s service vehicle) to help, I mean, watch him work on a baler in a field that is now Walmart and Home Depot in Auburn and a hundred other farms where things stopped working right,” recalled Dick. “Dad always said to keep lawn mowers, tractors – all equipment – under cover. It led to strange-looking covers but it kept things working.
“He also told us to always check our vehicles’ oil and other fluid levels. He would tell stories about the people who didn’t and about the problems they caused themselves, like having to buy a new engine.”
Thanks to Gordon, it became a family tradition to maintain fluids and regularly change the oil, whether they do it themselves or take the vehicle to a garage.
“He had this saying since school, changing the oil makes the engine ‘work fine and last a long time’,” said Dick. “One of my brothers is still trying to wear out a car bought by the youngest, who couldn’t wear it out himself because of Dad’s advice to always ‘check the fluids.’
“Dad learned it from a great man that he worked with, Bennie Benson, and thought it a good saying to pass on.”
Virginia worked seasonal jobs as she raised her kids. In the spring she worked at Camp Waziyatah in Waterford with her friend Dora Gardiner, cleaning and getting the buildings ready for the kids to spend the summer. Then in the fall she would pick apples for Charles Fillebrown at Fillebrown Orchards and always came home with good stories about how careful the crew and the boss were when they talked about Virginia crab apples.
“Our mother made sure we all knew how to plant and harvest different veggies,” said Richard. “She taught us the hard parts by tending a garden and having us pulling the weeds.”
After the Knights retired in 1996 they took to camping. They would take trips to Seboomook or just camp in their own yard, sometimes heading into town to camp with Virginia’s’ sister Priscilla and her husband Lowell Stinson. According to their sons, Gordon and Virginia were always the first to camp out in the spring and last to finally move back in the house at Thanksgiving time.
The Knights also became devoted square dancers, traveling around to different dances throughout New England. They served as past presidents of the Swinging Bears Square Dance Club based in South Paris.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25163217 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/VirginiaRichardDempseyChallenge2015.jpg" alt="" width="766" height="652" />
Virginia became a ham radio operator in her later years. She first became interested when she was little and a neighborhood friend taught her about ham radio. But her mother felt it would be too much of a distraction from her farm chores, so Virginia waited years before she found the time to pursue it.
“Later, she passed the test to be a ham radio operator to keep up with what us kids are doing,” said Dick. “And she has been on the road ever since, working communications for events like the Loon Echo Bike Trek and the Dempsey Challenge. You would find her at the Dempsey rest stop in Harrison working relay with the net control station in Lewiston.”
One of Gordon’s favorite pastimes is to go for rides and show his family where he used to haul logs out when he worked for Bourdon Scribner of Harrison.
“And to not be outdone, I always point the buildings where the log yards were and tell everyone how I wired electricity in them,” said Dick.
Even after 70 years Gordon and Virginia Knight continue their long partnership together and watch over their four sons and grandchildren Selena, Rachel and Travis. They recently welcomed their first great grandchild to the family.
“In sickness and in health” has been a serious matter for the couple, with Virginia taking Gordon to Lewiston 43 times for radiation treatments as he battled prostate cancer. On September 1, 2006, the two traveled to Delekto Brothers in Auburn, a normal routine until be became ill while doing business at the parts’ department. An ambulance rushed him to St. Mary’s Hospital in Lewiston, where they discovered he had suffered a brain stem stroke. Virginia drove to the hospital every day while he recovered in the hospital’s ICU unit and rapid rehab until he was moved closer to home at Market Square Health Care Center in South Paris.
“The one day she did not drive her van to visit and got a ride in a car was because the van had to have an all important oil change,” said Dick. “My father approved of the oil change. He probably would not have approved of the driver and the car she rode in to see him.”

Isolating through the pandemic did not cause Gordon and Virginia too much inconvenience.
“For them it was easy,” quipped Dick. “They stayed home like the Governor said to and let us kids make the daily 100-mile trip to find toilet paper.
“They also were able to enjoy watching the birds around Virginia’s feeder, as well as other animals.”
But although untouched by the pandemic, the aftermath it has made it difficult for the Knights’ children to plan a safe celebration for their 70th anniversary.
So the family is asking anyone who can – whether they personally know Gordon and Virginia Knight or not – to please send a card congratulating them on their long and successful life together. The address is: P.O. Box 165, Waterford, ME 04088.

The show will also feature Maine favorites: Julie Poulin, Dawn Hartill, Johnny Ater, Nic Dufault, and Mark Turcotte. The Lewiston-Auburn fireworks display is scheduled to begin at 9:30 over the Great Falls, just a short walk from Craft Brew Underground.
The show is for ages 21-and-older. Tickets are $8 and may be purchased at MaineEventComedy.com. Craft Brew Underground is located at 34 Court Street in Auburn. CBU offers more than 200 choices of craft beer, cider, and wine and was named “Maine’s Best Beer Bar” by CraftBeer.com.

The artwork of Jennifer Wadsworth is on display through July in the Woman’s Hospital Association Rotating Art Gallery at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-25215651" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/Jerico-wha-070221-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="300" />
Founder and director of the former Turner Center for the Arts, Wadsworth has been creating art since the 70s with a goal to engage friends and strangers in a visual conversation with her work. She hopes to inspire people to appreciate the moment and see the art in everything. This exhibit will showcase paintings of various ages including those in her private collection that have not been shown before. Her art is in private, corporate and academic collections in the United States, Europe and Asia. Her work is created with oil paint on various supports including primed canvas, tissue paper, raw canvas, synthetic canvas, Plexiglas, glass, fabric and wood. Her images are developed with the energy created by the application of the paint. She allows the page to speak to her instinct and follows the inspiration. She has mounted several solo and collaborative art exhibits in Maine and has participated in outdoor art festivals throughout Maine and New Hampshire since 1990. Her work has been exhibited in many juried exhibitions, including an exhibit at the Maine Center for Contemporary Art.
The works on display may be purchased through the WHA Gift Shop located adjacent to the main lobby at Central Maine Medical Center. As a result of the hospital safety precautions due to the pandemic, the art gallery is only available for viewing for staff, patients, and their designated visitors at this time. A percentage of sale proceeds benefits patients of CMMC.

Deb Cleveland — a book-lover, storyteller and beloved children’s librarian — will begin retirement Thursday after working at the Auburn Public Library for 21 years.
“My life here had purpose, because I was doing things for other people — for the kids and for the community,” said Cleveland, the head of Children’s Services and Family Place coordinator at the library. “I’m really honored and grateful that I had this opportunity to be here.”
For Cleveland, the best part about her job was, by far, Story Time every week.
She loved being able to connect with the kids in that way. It reminded her of how she used to read books to her boys when they were younger, and how her parents used to read to her and her sister when they were small.
Some of her favorite children’s books include “Wolf Coming” by Joe Kulka and “Blueberries for Sal” by Robert McCloskey. She also enjoys the works of Chris Van Dusen, Melissa Sweet and Shirley Hughes. She loves Melissa Sweet’s Alfie series because the artwork is “warm, cozy, and inviting.”
Of course, the list doesn’t stop there. Cleveland said she could “talk all day” about books, and she emphasized the importance of making sure kids read.
“I heard that if you start reading to a child early, you are really helping them with their development,” Cleveland said. “Those who are read to at an early age do better in school. “
“And stories can help kids understand other people,” she said. “When you read about people who are different from you, it gives you an opportunity to step into their shoes and see what other people are like, how people live in different places all over the world, how other people feel about things. Even if we have different opinions on things, or different political views, we have much more in common, and stories can bring people together that way.”
She said children’s librarians can play a role in helping them enjoy reading, since they are focused on children’s literature and children’s books and can make sure that kids are getting access to the “best books.”
While she won’t be working at the library anymore, that doesn’t mean she’s leaving behind her love for stories.
In August, Cleveland is due to become a grandmother and is super excited to read stories to and spend time with her new grandchild. As she begins a new chapter of her life, it is quite clear that she is leaving behind a legacy of stories which will be cherished and recounted by those who knew her.
Maureen Goff, a former volunteer at the computer lab in the Auburn Public Library, said Cleveland is “just a great gal.”
“I’d go downstairs to visit her when I was there on Tuesdays, but mostly, I’d see her when I brought children into the library. She was always helpful, pleasant, never in a bad mood, and very outgoing,” Goff said. “You could tell she loved her job.”
Zack Reinstein, one half of the Maine-based kindie rock duo, Fun Run, and who works alongside his wife, Mia, said they often credit Deb for kicking off their career.
“Three summers ago, we started shopping around at libraries to see if we can play and Deb was the first librarian to get back to us, offering us a show,” Reinstein said. “Without her, I don’t know if we’d be as successful as we are right now.”
He mentioned that during the pandemic, he and his wife did three Facebook Live shows, which were “all (Cleveland’s) idea.” After one of the shows, Cleveland told him that she and the other library staff members had been “dancing around” to their music.
Susan Weiss, a trustee on the board of directors at the Auburn Public Library, said Cleveland is “such a touchstone” in the library.
“She’s just there,” Weiss said. “You go into the children room and there’s Deb.”
She recounted a story where Cleveland helped her in the past year.
“I have a granddaughter who lives in Brooklyn, New York, but was here during COVID, and to keep her in touch with her friends from Brooklyn, her parents made a story zoom and I was selected to be the reader one night, and I didn’t have time to go to the library, and I emailed Deb and said “Deb, please help me, what’s a good story for a 5-year-old?”
Soon after receiving that message, Cleveland gave Weiss a bag of library books which she picked up. All the books were perfect for the age level.
“I really appreciate the extra work she put in because she didn’t have to do that,” Weiss said. “She’s real stable. She’s real solid. She’s real, kind, loving, intelligent, knows kids, knows children’s books. She’s been an anchor in the children’s room, for me, and for our whole community.”
“She will be missed,” Weiss said.
The feeling is mutual. Cleveland said she will miss her work colleagues, the families that came into the library, the kids, and Story Time.
“The whole state of Maine is really fortunate that the Maine library community is very supportive and innovative,” Cleveland said. “I’m just grateful to have been a part of such a wonderful group of people. I really am.”

Janet Mills says no to making Maine first in nation to decriminalize prostitution for its victims

Texto completo: Gov. Janet Mills vetoed a bill this week that would have put Maine in the forefront of a growing movement to decriminalize prostitution.
“Fully decriminalizing prostitution, I fear, will only increase demand and encourage the exploitation of young people by those who profit from the mistreatment of others, undermining the free will of those trapped in difficult and sometimes tragic circumstances,” Mills said in her veto message.
While the governor, a former prosecutor and attorney general, expressed support for trying “to reduce human trafficking and protect survivors of human trafficking,” she said she is “not convinced that the approach of this bill is the best path forward.”
Those pushing the measure, including District Attorney Andrew Robinson in Lewiston, said the proposal would decriminalize prostitution, allow its victims to have past convictions sealed and focus efforts on helping those who, as Robinson put it, are “caught up in the nightmare circumstances of human trafficking and sexual exploitation.”
Robinson, who prosecutes cases in Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties, declined to comment on Mills’ veto.
The basic notion behind the bill is to reduce the legal consequences of getting caught selling sex and to increase the penalty for those caught buying sex from people who are often exploited.
It’s an issue that Mills said she’s long been concerned about.
The governor said in her veto message that she worries sex traffickers, or pimps, will point to the measure “as a way to entice more people” into the sex trade by telling victims “that what they are doing is not a problem.”
“No state in the nation has fully legalized commercial sex work,” Mills said. “Even in Nevada, known as the only state to have legal commercial sex work, prostitution is still illegal outside regulated designated facilities in a single county.”
“By contrast, this bill would make Maine the first state in the nation to eliminate all penalties for engaging in sex for money,” Mills said.
Existing state law classified engaging in prostitution as a Class E crime punishable only with a fine. While purchasing sex is also a Class E crime, it can be punished with jail time.
The bill would have eliminated penalties for selling sex while charging purchasers with a Class D crime. If someone tries to solicit paid sex from a minor, the bill would have upped the charge to a Class C crime.
A recent legal change allows sex sellers to offer an affirmative defense if they engaged in prostitution “prevent bodily injury, serious economic hardship or another threat to the person or another person.”
Mills called that provision “a more measured approach for promoting both public safety and compassion for survivors of sex trafficking” than the changes eyed in the bill supported by Robinson.
Another provision in the bill would have established a pilot program in Androscoggin County that would have created “a coordinated response among the agencies and organizations providing direct services to victims of commercial sexual exploitation and sex trafficking,” according to testimony by Nate Walsh, an assistant district attorney.
Walsh, who works on human trafficking cases in Robinson’s office, urged legislators to adopt the new approach called “the equality model” because it “shifts the focus from the victims to the sex buyers. If people
wouldn’t buy people, people wouldn’t sell people.”
“Addressing demand holds accountable those who inflict harm and exploit vulnerable people for sex,” he said. “Sex buyers are the ones in the equation who are deserving of a criminal penalty.”
“However, it shouldn’t end there,” Walsh said. “We should work to educate our communities about the harm that is being done through prostitution. We should talk about male entitlement. We should stop using the criminal justice system as the gatekeeper for access to services that should be provided to prevent involvement in the criminal justice system.”

LEWISTON – State health officials reported just 12 new cases of COVID-19 and no additional deaths Wednesday as Maine’s civil state of emergency came to an end 15-and-a-half months after Gov. Janet Mills issued her first declaration.
“It’s not that we’ve cured the disease, or that we’ve banned the virus or removed the pandemic forever from our lives, or that we’ve thrown caution to the wind or that everything now is exactly how it was 16 months ago, but the state of civil emergency is no longer necessary,” Mills said. “It is over and it is time.”
Mills, along with Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah and Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Dr. Jeanne Lambrew, gave the state’s final regularly scheduled briefing on COVID-19 from the cabinet room in the Maine State House in Augusta.
“Pandemics don’t end with the expiration of a declaration. Rather, they end with a prolonged exaltation. That’s the case here,” Shah said, who has briefed the media 190 times over the past 16 months.
Of Wednesday’s new cases, two are in Franklin County and there is one each in Androscoggin and Oxford counties. On average, 22.3 Maine people have tested positive for the disease over the past seven days, a significant decrease from the seven-day rolling average just four weeks ago, which was at 83.7.
Adjusted for population, there is an average of 0.17 new daily cases per 10,000 individuals across the state over the past seven days, down from 0.62 on June 2. Androscoggin County’s seven-day average per 10,000 individuals is 0.29 as of Wednesday; Franklin and Oxford counties’ averages are 0.52 and 0.12, respectively.
A rolling average of new daily cases smooths out day-to-day blips and dips in numbers and provides a more accurate look at case rate trends over a period of time. The seven-day average per capita is most accurate for comparison’s sake.
With the exception of Franklin County, the seven-day average of new daily cases of COVID-19 per capita has decreased from one month ago. While Androscoggin and Oxford counties’ daily new cases are decreasing, trends in Franklin County appear to be more volatile.
Four weeks ago, on June 2, the seven-day average of new daily cases was 0.38 per 10,000 residents in Franklin County. Two weeks later, on June 16, the average went up to 0.95 cases per 10,000 residents. And one week ago, the county’s seven-day average was down to its lowest level since October, at 0.09 cases per 10,000 residents.
A Flourish chart
“Though the emergency ends, COVID continues,” Shah said. “There will continue to be cases of COVID, there will continue to be outbreaks of COVID, there will continue to be hospitalizations and sadly, deaths.”
Thirty individuals across the state were hospitalized Wednesday with COVID-19, including 18 in critical care, eight of whom are on a ventilator.
Central Maine Medical Center had no COVID-19 inpatients Wednesday and St. Mary’s Regional Medical Center had just two, but none were in critical care.
“But how much longer, with what intensity and with what impact on our state and our lives, well, that’s up to us and specifically, how many of us get vaccinated,” Shah said.
Statewide, 58.4% of all Maine residents are fully vaccinated. Of all Androscoggin County residents, 50.6% are fully vaccinated. Franklin and Oxford counties have yet to break the 50% mark; 49.7% and 49.8% of residents there are fully vaccinated, respectively.
The vaccination rate increases when considering only those who are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, or those 12 years and older. Statewide, 66.3% of all eligible Mainers are fully vaccinated. In Androscoggin County, 59.1% of eligible residents are fully vaccinated, in Franklin County, 56.01% and in Oxford County, 56.2% of residents are fully vaccinated.
By both metrics, the tri-county area is among the least vaccinated in the state.
“The vaccines are key here and we have undersold their effectiveness,” Shah said.
Vaccinations among health care personnel are also of concern, Shah noted previously. According to data from the Maine DHHS, staff at CMMC and St. Mary’s have the lowest vaccination rates of Maine’s 38 hospitals. As of May 31, 58.1% of CMMC staff and 52.1 of St. Mary’s staff are fully vaccinated. About 74% of all hospital personnel in the state are fully vaccinated.
Officials from the Lewiston hospitals said previously that the way the data was collected skews the “real” number of vaccinated personnel and spokespeople from both said 65% is a more accurate vaccination rate.
Earlier this week, the association representing Maine hospitals indicated their support for a blanket requirement for all health care personnel to be vaccinated against COVID-19, once they have received full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The three vaccines available in the U.S. – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – were granted emergency use authorization by the FDA, a mechanism to “facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies,” according to the agency.
Following the association’s statement, CMMC Chief Medical Officer Dr. John Alexander said Tuesday that hospital leadership is still not considering mandating the COVID-19 vaccine for its staff.
“There is certainly a sense of urgency around the COVID vaccine and making sure that we’re doing everything we can to prevent further spread, which does primarily include vaccinations now as one of the key choices,” Alexander said. “Like I said, we’ll have to wait and see where the FDA lands in terms of the approval process.”
Alexander said hospital leadership will reevaluate the situation if and when the vaccines receive full approval, but declined to speculate on what might factor into that decision.
St. Mary’s spokesperson Steve Costello said Wednesday that leadership there hasn’t changed their stance, either: “We are watching closely what the MHA and CDC have to say on this subject but no decisions have been made at this time.”

AUBURN — Upgrades will continue at the Auburn-Lewiston Municipal Airport after U.S. Sen. Susan Collins announced $1.6 million in federal funding this week.
The announcement was part of $11.4 million through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Airport Improvement Program that will go to five Maine airports.
According to Bettyann Sheats, chairwoman of the airport’s board of directors, a majority of the funds will be used to reconstruct the “east ramp” on the Hotel Road side of the facility.
The section houses hangers used by LifeFlight and others. Sheats said the runway and parking area in that section of the airport are “in desperate need of being resurfaced.”
The project has been included in both cities’ capital improvement plan for some time, but the funding will allow the airport to move forward with the work.
The improvements come on the heels of much larger upgrades to the main runway that began in 2019. That $8.5 million project overhauled both runways and added new navigation lighting. Sheats said the line-painting on the new runway was just completed.
Also coming up for the airport will be self-serve fuel trucks that will allow LifeFlight and other tenants to refuel during off-hours.
This week’s funding will also go toward acquiring land within the airport approach route.
Sheats said the land has already been acquired from the Auburn Business Development Corp. and the funding is a reimbursement. The land was considered in the “protection zone” around the airport’s main runway.
Collins, the ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, said, “Maine’s airports are vital pieces of our state’s infrastructure that play a critical role not only in transportation and job creation, but also to provide medical services for rural communities in emergencies when seconds count. This critical investment will allow airports across our state to make much-needed improvements to their infrastructure, enhancing the safety and efficiency of operations and benefitting residents and visitors.”
Federal dollars also went to airports in Portland, Augusta, Belfast and Wiscasset.

Texto completo: <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-24547974" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/24516102_20210526_MVC_Track_7539.jpg" alt="" width="858" height="1000" />
Winthrop’s James Cognata didn’t lose much this spring.
Boys Track Finalists
• Atticus Soehren , senior, Oxford Hills, javelin
• Finn Thistle , senior, Edward Little, pole vault
• Tudum Monday , sophomore, Edward Little, hurdles
• Hunter Burkhardt , junior, Lisbon, distance
• Jacob Jackson , senior, Edward Little, jumps
Focusing on shorter distances for his sophomore season — and his first outdoor track season with Winthrop after losing out on a season last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic — Cognata did just enough in the winter to keep his body ready for when it counted.
There weren’t indoor track meets this past winter for Maine high schools so Cognata trained in an indoor facility in Topsham and kept his mileage at around 25 miles a week, preparing for the outdoor season.
Cognata competed at the AAU Indoor National Championships in March, finishing in second place in the 800-meter run and seventh in the 400-meter run, and was ready for outdoor races to finally show what he could do in Maine.
“I felt like I was a baseball player and I was in a slump and I just needed a good race to break out,” Cognata said. “I’d been training but it was hard to get back. During COVID I really had to rely on my coach, Ed Van Tassel.”
His first meet went well, but it was an adjustment for him with it being his first high school outdoor meet, masks still on faces and trying to establish a baseline for his times.
“It was at Hall-Dale and the expectation really wasn’t that high, but for what it was no one had run in a while and everyone was masked up and you could tell it had been so long,” Cognata said. “The first meet I didn’t post my greatest time but it was really great to get back out there.”
There was a breakthrough point for Cognata, and from there it was fast time after fast time.
“It was a race at Wiscasset with Boothbay and I hadn’t posted great times yet,” Cognata said. “My times were good but they were the same as eighth grade. My 400, it was you and yourself in that race, it doesn’t matter if you’re running alone or not. I posted a 51, a (personal record by three seconds), and it felt so great to post that. Then I had a shot at my school record.”
After winning both the 400, 4×800 and the 200 in the Mountain Valley Conference North championships, Cognata turned his attention to the Class C state meet, where all his offseason and in-season work culminated in the 200 and 400.
“In the 400, I was pretty confident, I’m not going to lie,” Cognata said. “I was feeling good and I was the top seed by a second or two, that was my strongest one.”
Cognata ran a PR of 50.62, breaking Winthrop’s school record.
The 400 win was followed by an upset of sorts in the 200, where the Winthrop sophomore entered the race behind Traip Academy’s Treshaun Brown in seed time.
“In the 200, I was shaky,” Cognata said. “I was the third seed and there was a guy who was like a second and a half ahead of me, but then at conferences I ran a PR and he was only four-tenths of a second ahead of me. I was still a little worried but I ended up pulling through. The guy from Traip had me in the first turn but I ended up nipping him at the end.”
Cognata’s 23.61 was a PR again, his second state title as only a sophomore and he followed his two titles with a fourth-place finish as part of Winthrop’s 4×400-meter relay team, maybe his favorite event.
“To be able to place felt really good because it makes me feel like we can do even better next year if we want,” Cognata said. “The 4×400 is at the end so I can give it my all.”
Next season, Cognata said he is going to be moving to distance events such as the 1,600-meter and the 3,200-meter and hopes to do just as well as his two golds this spring.

Operations are to commence on Saturday, July 3, and run through the end of the foliage season in mid-October.
Its operating schedule is available online at srrl-rr.org, but may be subject to change because of the availability of equipment and train crews.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Outdoor safety courses such as swimming lessons are being developed by Lewiston Public Schools in response to student drownings.
Superintendent Jake Langlais told the School Committee on Wednesday that one way the district could provide these classes would be by expanding its Maine Guide course.
“We are looking at a way to grow that and maybe grow it downward (to schools other than the high school),” Langlais said.
He said learning to swim, knowing how river water flows and the danger of cold water are essential lessons in a city connected to a waterway.
“The tragic loss of a student one day after school got out was very difficult for our community,” he said. “In fact, we’ve lost two students to water-related events.”
Isha Ali, a 13-year-old middle schooler, died after going underwater in the Androscoggin River on June 7. Authorities said she wasn’t wearing a life jacket and did not know how to swim.
On June 12, 2018, Rayan Issa, also 13, drowned in Range Pond in Poland during a school field trip. He also did not know how to swim.
In a memo to the School Committee, Langlais wrote that administrators are in the brainstorming phase and would be coordinating meetings with stakeholders and community resources.
Ideas include:
· Water safety courses or topics woven into the curriculum.
· Swimming lessons.
· Scene safety and hazards.
· A science fair-like event focusing on topics of outdoor safety.
· Expanding the Maine Guide program.
· Informational sessions and pamphlets for families at strategic times.
“We are hopeful to find sustainable ways to grow this knowledge/skill set in our community,” he wrote in the memo. “I am hopeful we can open this up for discussion to continue to gather ideas.”
Committee member Kiernan Majerus-Collins said he fully supported the effort.
“This issue is critically important and as we’ve seen, a matter of life and death,” he said. Every student in Lewiston public schools should learn to swim, he said.
He said the continued closure of the Kennedy Park swimming pool made the situation even more dangerous.
“I can’t even begin to express how angry I am about that,” he said.
He said he hoped the district could work with Bates College to set up courses and should require all middle school students to learn to swim.
New committee member Janet Beaudoin argued that learning to swim should not be a mandate but a personal choice.
“There are lots of things we require students to learn — reading, math, civics,” Majerus-Collins said. “We have a responsibility to provide a meaningful education, especially when we’ve lost two students.”

Texto completo: Coach’s kid. High school state champion. University of Maine point guard. A coach elsewhere before returning to Orono.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25211013" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/untitled-3181.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="600" />
That’s a synopsis of Courtney England’s basketball life. It also fits the script of England’s boss, UMaine women’s head coach Amy Vachon. England’s trajectory will now follow Vachon’s in one more was: Black Bears associate head coach.
Vachon recently promoted England, a 2011 Leavitt high school graduate when she was known as Courtney Anderson, from assistant coach to associate head coach — the same promotion that Vachon was given in 2016 by then-women’s coach Richard Barron, who now coaches the UMaine men’s team.
“It’s great. I mean, every day, regardless of what my title is, it’s a blessing to come to work and know that you’re going to do something that you love with people that you love to work with, and to get to see our players every day and just work with them through a process, which I enjoyed so much as a player,” England said. “It’s a blessing, regardless of the title, but the title is really cool, too.”
Vachon, who started coaching at UMaine when Barron, now the Black Bears men’s coach, took over as head coach in 2011, said England has been instrumental in turning the Black Bears program around, starting with her time as a player. Following her graduation in 2015, England spent two years away from the UMaine program — first as Director of Basketball Operations and an assistant coach at New Hampshire (where her younger sister Kristen was a player), then as an assistant at Presbyterian College in South Carolina — before returning to Maine as part of Vachon’s coaching staff.
“She’s just really worked hard,” Vachon said. “She’s very smart, she’s very talented and she just creates great relationships with our players. So everything that you would want in an assistant coach and an associate head coach, Courtney has it.”
England participated in the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association’s “So You Want To Be A Coach” program in 2015. But she had the coaching itch long before that.
“Honestly, I started coaching from a young age. I started coaching AAU right after I got done playing AAU, so I started coaching on teams that my sister player for,” England said. “I knew that the thinking behind the game was something I really enjoyed. So the X’s and O’s. And then just really developing players, like I had done small, individual workouts with people back home as soon as I started playing college, and with younger kids in my community and stuff. And so I really enjoyed the player development aspect of it. I really enjoy the X’s and O’s aspect of it. I enjoy just watching people grow. I was an education major here as well. So, I mean, kind of been in my DNA for a while. It’s something that I enjoy doing, in every sense of it. So I think for a long time that coaching was kind of what I felt like I was going to be really good at.”
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25211082 size-large" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/SPTleavittgreeleygbb3P021910-1024x702.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="702" />
Coaching is in England’s blood. At Leavitt, she played for her mother Tammy Anderson, whom England said she is similar to personality-wise “when it comes to what we enjoy doing, so the coaching was kind of no different from that.”
“Getting to play for my mother, getting to watch my mother coach, it really just drove home that this was kind of a passion of mine as well,” England added.
Like England, Vachon also was a coach’s kid. She won two state championships playing for her father Paul Vachon at Cony. Interestingly, Vachon’s two Class A state titles as a player came right after Cindy Blodgett — her future UMaine teammate — helped lead Lawrence to four-consecutive Class A titles. Blodgett was the UMaine coach that recruited England to play for the Black Bears, but she was fired following the 2010-2011 season. Vachon was on Barron’s staff the next year, after coaching Catherine McAuley High School to the Class A state championship the day after England won the Class B title with Leavitt.
Vachon, speaking from experience, said England being a coach’s kid has helped her development as a coach, but she also noted that she and England are different types of people, despite all their similarities. She said having a coaching staff full of clones wouldn’t work.
“You have to have different personalities and different strengths,” Vachon said.
Differences as people and coaches aside, England said the coaching staff, which also includes Tom Biskup and former Maine high school star and Black Bears player Parise Rossignol, is truly a family.
“Like this past year, just in general, I spent Thanksgiving, saw them around Christmas like every day. We all work out of the same one office, the same table,” England said. “For me, personally, after watching — well, knowing — Amy when I was growing up as a kid playing basketball, and then to play for her when I was here and she was an assistant coach, and that now to work with her and coach with her, it’s awesome. It’s great every day.”
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25211019 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/untitled-3261-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />
UMaine has had plenty of success during England’s time on the staff, advancing to the America East title game every year, and winning it twice. Vachon said everything is a team effort, and everyone has their role, and that England does her role “very well.”
That role won’t change much despite the promotion, both England and Vachon said.
“Responsibilities stay the same,” England said. “I think every Division I coaching staff — except for I don’t know about Ivy League — but you get three assistants and give them whatever titles that you deem fit. So I think Coach Vachon thought that I deserved a promotion in that regard, and that was great to see some work recognized, but my job description hasn’t really changed, in that sense.”
The Black Bears’ roster will change drastically from last year’s, England said. There are 11 underclassmen and gone are many of the biggest names from the recent championship teams. But England is excited about the future of the program, in terms of both the chance to develop the young roster as well as the facility changes coming to UMaine as part of a donation from the Alfond Foundation.
“For us, it’s always exciting to be here at Maine, but I think it’s a very exciting time, just for the athletic department in general, and definitely for me,” England said.
Vachon said the future is equally bright for England.
“If coaching is her passion, if coaching is something she wants to do, if head coaching is, if not, whatever it is, Court can put her mind to something and really do it well,” Vachon said.

REGION — With much of Oxford Hills missing out on Independence Day events it is appropriate to consider some of the figures who made American independence possible, fighting for it during the American Revolution. After the war, dozens of veterans made their way east to settle the Maine frontier and make their marks on the fledgling nation. Here are the stories of three different war veterans who took different paths to the area and became part of its lore.
Norway
Jacob Frost, who settled in Norway in 1800, was one of those soldiers whose legend is true but included at least a token of embellishment that took root through the years.
A native of Tewkesbury, Mass, Frost was a soldier with the colonial army that met British troops at the Battle of Bunker Hill. After being wounded in the hip by a musket ball he was captured and imprisoned at Fort Halifax. Despite receiving little medical attention and with the bullet lodged in his hip, Frost and three fellow Americans managed to remove a stone from the wall of their prison cell and dig their way out beneath it.
Although one man was unfortunately too large to squeeze through the escape tunnel, Frost and two of his comrades began making their way west towards Massachusetts. Their plan to evade recapture was to travel under cover of darkness and hide during daylight hours. The still injured Frost was concealed by the other two soldiers with leaves under a blown down tree while they hid separately.
As Frost nestled in his makeshift blind, a group of British soldiers dispatched to recover the escaped prisoners sat on the very tree he was hidden under, discussing their orders and likely providing details that allowed the Americans to evade them once the sun set.
The trio had received little to eat in prison and so saved almost no rations ahead of their escape; hunger was at times the most dangerous threat they faced. Stopping at one farm, the most they could pilfer was an old shoe which they tore into shares and chewed. Frost is to have said the leather was the sweetest morsel he ever ate.
Occasionally they managed to rustle up a hen out of a barn but as DownEast Maine was largely inhabited by Tories, colonists loyal to England, they dared not build fires for cooking and ate their meals raw.
One day they dared knock on a colonist’s door to beg for food. Against the odds, the woman of the house invited them in to hastily eat and take more food with them before her husband returned, certain that he would turn them over to the Tory authorities.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-25183758" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/jacob-frost-norway-288x300.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="300" />
In 1800 when Frost traveled north, this time immigrating from Massachusetts to Norway, he carried with him a cannon ball inscribed with his name and that of Bunker Hill, where he presumably recovered it from. That ball is now in the collections housed at the Norway Historical Society.
“The cannon ball is attributed to Jacob Frost,” says Susan Denison, curator for the historical society. “We also know darn well that he didn’t take it Halifax with him, although it’s possibly true it was from Bunker Hill.
“It was at the Norway Library for years and years, I remember it as a kid. It’s probably a cannon ball from that era and maybe it came from Bunker Hill. That it was a souvenir taken by Jacob Frost is unlikely, because we know what happened to him.”
There was, however, one souvenir that Frost certainly carried from Boston to Halifax, back to Massachusetts and then finally to Norway. And that is the musket ball that put him out of the battle and into enemy hands during the Battle of Bunker Hill. The bullet had been left in his hip since 1775 and was only removed in the 1830s, a few years before he died.
Paris
Isaac Bolster came to Paris with his family in 1784. Born in Uxbridge, Mass. on April 27, 1825, Bolster’s first military service came in the 1750s during the French and Indian Wars. Not much is known about his role in the colonial militia then. He married Mary Dwinell in 1761; the couple had their first child the same year.
More is known about Bolster’s time in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, thanks in part to a soldier he recruited as the war began in April 1775, Samuel Bixby. Bixby kept a diary of his time in Capt. Bolster’s regiment, providing glimpses into happenings during the next several months.
Bixby’s entry of June 17, 1775 indicates that Bolster’s troops were not engaged when the colonists clashed with the British Army at Bunker Hill. Stationed at Roxbury, Bixby makes note of General George Washington arrival on July 5. At that time Bolster’s unit was engaged in building fortifications in case of an enemy attack.
Late that summer tragedy struck Bolster’s family when three of his seven children all died within two days of one another.
According to family accounts, Bolster reenlisted in 1776, serving that year in the New York Campaign where Washington struggled to keep his army intact while attempting to wrest a superior enemy from its stronghold of New York City.
By 1780 Bolster was focused on business ventures, acquiring land in Oxford and Hebron, Maine and settling there with his family in 1784. His last and 11th child, Solomon, was born in Paris in 1789. Only three of his children would outlive him, Abraham (second, born 1763), Deacon Isaac (fifth, born 1769) and David (10th, born 1782).
Bolster was also involved with local politics, serving as selectman and allying himself with the region’s proprietors. He was among those who opposed Paris incorporating as its own town, which was granted in 1793 by the faraway state government in Massachusetts.
As a Paris resident, Bolster made his living as a trader and operated a store/tavern. His account books during the 1790s listed products like rum, rice, fish, wine, salt, tea, scythes, molasses, sugar and spices.
After Bolster’s wife Mary died in 1814 he remarried to Aphia Stephens Smith of Turner. Little of Aphia’s life is recorded but their marriage was also her second. She had married Seba Smith in 1788; their son of the same name would become one of Maine’s early noted humorists.
When he died on April 27, 1825 Aphia was granted $800 from debts owed to Bolster by others, indicating that he was also in the loan business.
Bolster’s will also stated that Aphia would receive from his estate: “…I give her all my household furniture and her own wearing apparel, also one cow; also I give her the wool of five sheep so long as she shall remain single … also I give her the use of my horse and chaise and harness and my sleigh and harness so long as she shall remain single, also I give her the use of my bridle and side saddle…”
The bulk of his estate seems to have been distributed among his three surviving sons.
While it is not known what motivated Bolster to place future conditions on his widow’s inheritance, it did not motivate her to mourn his death very long; by November of 1825 Aphia Stephens Smith Bolster married her third husband, John S. Carey of Leeds.
As one of the town’s early residents, Bolster put an influential stamp on Paris through community leadership, real estate and business dealings, and the generations of Bolsters to come.
Norway
Born in 1759 (with the last name “Buck”), Samuel Ames was 16 years old at the start of the American Revolution. He served in the conflict for one year, as a drummer in Col. Wesson’s Ninth Massachusetts Regiment in Saratoga, NY.
While some of the Revolutionary War veterans who found their way to Norway following the war had more dramatic narratives, such as Jacob Frost or Lemuel Shedd, who acted as a body guard to General George Washington and carried his messages to General Horatio Gates during the campaign that saw British General John Burgoyne surrender to Gates’ army in 1777, Ames made substantial contributions that helped the Norway community solidify and grow.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-25180536" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/ames-home-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" />
Ames moved to Norway from Paris in 1789, just a few years after the town’s original settlers began clearing what was then known as “Rustfield” and named for its founding developer, George Rust of Salem, Mass.
Ames is said to have been the first miller of the community; built the first “habitation” in the village and also the town’s first wagons. Ames is listed as a founder of the Universalist Church that formed in 1799 and incorporated in 1805. His legend states that it was he who beat the first drum ever heard in Norway.
Ames could also possibly claim the title of Norway’s first conservationist. Outdoor enthusiasts today have him to thank for Norway’s ancient open space gem, Ordway Grove. Ames purchased the property when he moved to Norway and acted as protector and steward for its stand of pines, some of which may date from the end of the 17th century and have recorded heights approaching 140 feet and girths of 11 feet.
Ames held onto the property for the rest of his life. After he died in 1852 it was eventually sold to John A. Ordway who held title to it until the 1880s. The forest then changed hands several times, often at risk of being lumbered and also rejected by the town of Norway for a park space during the 1920s.
In 1931 the last 10 acres of Ordway Grove was rescued by an anonymous buyer who then donated it to Norway’s Twin Town Nature Club, where it remains protected and open to the public.
Ames also provided first-person accounts to David Noyes near the final days of his life as the latter compiled the first history of Norway.
He passed away in Greenwood on August 23, 1852.

Texto completo: A painting attributed to 20th-century master Pablo Picasso that was recently discovered in a closet in Maine sold at auction over the weekend in Amesbury, Mass., for more than $150,000.
The Amesbury-based John McInnis Auctioneers confirmed via phone Wednesday that the work sold Saturday. The website liveauctioneers.com reported the sale price was $150,000, plus a 24 percent buyer's premium. The buyer wasn't named.
The McInnis official website contains a link to a press release on the painting posted to artfixdaily.com. Per the release, the painting's entitled “Le Tricorne,” a 16-by-16-inch mixed media work on paper, signed and dated 1919.
The McInnis site also linked to a description of the work — provided by the owner of the Maine residence where it was found — posted to liveauctioneers.com.
The homeowner wasn't identified by name but said the work is a “maquette for Picasso's largest work by the same title on exhibit at the New-York Historical Society, New York City.” A maquette is a term for a preliminary work or sketch.
The homeowner's aunt and grandmother had both studied in Europe in the 1920s, and they each collected objects from their travels, the person wrote.
“My aunt collected rare books and art,” the homeowner wrote. “Each led an interesting life with uncommon travels which was afforded to them through their uncle who owned mills in Maine. ... This painting was discovered in a house owned by my great aunt which was passed down to her from her uncle in the late 1930s.”
The piece, the homeowner continued, was one of several paintings “kept in a closet for 50 years ... which were left by her at the time of the passing of the house to my father and now to me.”
Before the transaction's completed, the buyer will have at least 120 days to authenticate the work with the Picasso Administration, managed by the artist's son, photographer and filmmaker Claude Picasso, the liveauctioneers.com report said.
The elder Picasso produced more than 20,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, and photographs, cementing his status as one of the leading 20th-century art stars of the West. He died in 1973.
The MFA in 2016 mounted the wildly popular exhibition “Pairing Picasso,” which divided 11 of his works into groupings: four pairs and a trio.

Maine Mariners announced as Bruins' new ECHL affiliate

Texto completo: The Maine Mariners announced Wednesday that it will become an ECHL affiliate of the Bruins, joining the Portland Sea Dogs and Maine Celtics as sporting connections between Maine's largest city and New England's sports heavyweights.
The Bruins' affiliate in the ECHL — the second tier of the NHL's minor leagues, beneath the Springfield-based American Hockey League — has been the Atlanta Gladiators since 2015. Like Maine, Atlanta voluntarily opted not to participate in the 2020-21 season due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the Bruins unofficially sharing the Jacksonville club this past season with the Winnipeg Jets.
“We are extremely excited to be affiliated with the Bruins organization and we're proud to solidify the Boston-Portland connection with all three of Maine's professional sports franchises,” said Mariners President Danny Briere. “We can't wait to bring live hockey action back to Portland this fall, and we know that Mariners fans will be thrilled to watch players from the Bruins organization playing right here in Maine.”
A previous iteration of the Maine Mariners was Boston's AHL affiliate from 1987-92, before the franchise was wooed to Providence and rechristened the Providence Bruins, where they regularly rank among the league's top draws. The AHL's Baltimore franchise relocated to Portland for the 1993-94 season, becoming the Portland Pirates and winning the Calder Cup in its first year.
The Pirates played 23 seasons at the former Cumberland County Civic Center until being sold in May 2016. The new owners moved them to Springfield, a longtime AHL city which had lost its most recent franchise.
Portland joined up with the ECHL — formerly the East Coast Hockey League, but renamed in 2003 after having expanded nationwide — in June 2017 when Comcast Spectacor bought its dormant Alaska franchise and moved it to Portland's Cross Insurance Arena, which it manages through a subsidiary and which lacked a primary tenant after the Pirates' departure.
The Mainers had previously been affiliated with the New York Rangers. On Tuesday, the Rangers announced they were shifting their ECHL affiliate to Jacksonville, Fla.
While affiliated with the Rangers, the team missed the playoffs in its inaugural year of 2018-19, ranking sixth-lowest in the 27-team ECHL with 2,998 fans per game, and was facing a similar fate when COVID-19 halted the 2019-20 season.
Worcester also participates in the ECHL, and the two New England clubs formed the North Division in 2019-20 with teams from Adirondack, N.Y.; Reading, Pa.; Brampton, Ontario; and St. John's, Newfoundland. A team in Manchester, N.H., folded after the 2018-19 season.
The Mariners' 2021-22 season will begin on Oct. 22. See the full schedule here.

Texto completo: New England’s coastline is dotted with idyllic islands where flawless beaches are abundant and natural beauty is around every bend. Low-key island pleasures include salty sea swims, sandy sunset strolls and eating fresh seafood at casual lobster shacks.
It's a low-impact getaway, as a bicycle or your own two feet are favored methods of transportation. Islands have a remote, rustic feel and sense of seclusion that’s a balm for these times. In truth, they’re easily accessible via causeway or breezy ferry ride.
If you're looking to satisfy your wanderlust on a getaway with plenty of nautical charm, consider these 10 scenic islands, all with hotels for a comfortable overnight stay.
Mount Desert Island, Maine
Mount Desert Island is Maine’s largest coastal island. Home to Acadia National Park, its beauty is so intense it borders on mystical. Hikers, cyclists and horseback riders will find trails interlaced with wide carriage roads carpeted with crushed stones, winding past ponds and woodlands.
These Atlantic waters are a tad chilly for many swimmers, though nature cruises and lobster boat rides put you in pole position to glimpse seals, porpoises and whales frolicking.
Stay: Overlooking Frenchman's Bay in Bar Harbor, Harborside Hotel, Spa & Marina is a relaxed retreat at Acadia National Park’s doorstep.
Block Island, Rhode Island
Block Island is a nautical paradise with 17 miles of sandy beach, hundreds of freshwater ponds and water so blue that you might think you’re in the Caribbean. With over 250 bird species landing here annually, it’s an avian wonderland. A web of walkways connects miles of unspoiled habitat with stunning vistas. Ponder the immensity of Mohegan Bluffs and hike rolling trails at Rodman’s Hollow.
Foodies shouldn’t miss a meal at Champlin’s Galley House, where the chef spins magic with just-caught seafood.
Stay: Overlooking Crescent Beach, Block Island Beach House has vintage-inspired rooms with sea views and a wrap-around porch. Warm hospitality wraps it in a bow.
Great Diamond Island, Maine
Great Diamond Island was once a retreat for American literary greats such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Today, visitors may explore this car-free jewel’s Casco Bay landscapes and maritime tranquility on a bike or golf cart. Sheltered beaches, old-growth forest and historic Fort McKinley are just a speedy ferry ride from Portland’s Old Port district.
Stay: Inn at Diamond Cove offers 44 condo-style units. A heated pool, firepit, tennis courts and restored turn-of-the-century duckpin bowling alley are surrounded by peaceful walking trails.
Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts
Old-fashioned lighthouses and pristine beaches are some of Martha’s Vineyard’s seaside charms. Enchanting villages include Edgartown, its narrow lanes framed with dignified Greek revival homes once inhabited by whaling captains.
Kids (and kids at heart) will enjoy a ride on a painted pony at Oak Bluff’s Flying Horses Carousel and a nostalgic nibble at Murdick’s Fudge, where they’ve used the same delicious candy recipes since 1887.
Stay: Edgartown Inn’s village location and farmhouse aesthetic are a winning combination.
Peaks Island, Maine
Just a 17-minute ferry ride from Portland, Peaks Island feels a million miles away. It’s a close-knit community with both rocky and sandy beaches and a quirky Umbrella Cover Museum, which is exactly what it sounds like. Swim or kayak to Catnip Island from Sandy Beach for an easy adventure.
Simple pleasures include enjoying a cup of island-roasted coffee at Peaks Island Coffee Roasters and a just-baked cinnamon bun at Peaks Café.
Stay: Inn on Peaks offers seven cottage-style rooms with Jacuzzi tubs and private decks.
Nantucket, Massachusetts
Nantucket’s cranberry bogs and windswept bluffs paint a dreamy panorama. Understated elegance and 82 miles of enviable coastline help to explain why loyal beachcombers return each year.
Shady bike paths are ideal for cycling. Pedal to Siasconset, a fairytale hamlet brushed with rose-covered cottages. Stop by the Nantucket Lightship Basket Museum and view unique hand-woven rattan and wood baskets that have been made here for centuries.
Stay: Occupying a prime in-town location, boutique Greydon House offers 20 stylish rooms.
Monhegan Island, Maine
Monhegan Island is a rocky haven where lobster traps line unpaved roads leading to yesteryear villages, verdant meadows and high ocean cliffs. Known for its robust art community, watch artists create in their studios, visit a crafts co-op, and explore Monhegan Museum of Art & History. Build an appetite traversing miles of hiking trails and sample some of Maine’s freshest lobster.
Stay: Fall asleep to the sound of the sea at Monhegan House, a simple bed and breakfast with 26 rooms and lighthouse views.
New Castle, New Hampshire
Located off New Hampshire’s 17-mile sliver of seacoast, New Castle captivates. Visit Fort Constitution’s Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouse and soak in history, as the American Revolution’s first victory took place here. Stop by Great Island Common, a shoreline green space with sailboats breezing by.
Connected by bridge to neighboring Rye and Portsmouth, it’s perfectly situated to investigate Portsmouth’s dynamic food scene or jump waves at Jenness State Beach.
Stay: Upscale Wentworth by the Sea is nestled on flower-filled grounds with harbor views, swimming pools and delectable dining options.
Vinalhaven, Maine
In the middle of Penobscot Bay sits Vinalhaven, an oasis of pink-hued granite that was once used to build important monuments throughout America. Home to one of Maine’s most lucrative fleets of lobster boats, it’s a working island with a vital year-round population that swells in summer.
Known for its commitment to conservation, the island's patchwork of walking trails is an excellent way to soak in suggestive scenery. When it’s time to cool off, jump in crystal-clear water at one of two refreshing swimming holes, Booth’s Quarry and Lawson’s Quarry.
Stay: The Tidewater offers homey rooms, some with private terraces.
Chebeague Island, Maine
Postcard-pretty Chebeague island is Casco Bay’s largest unconnected island. Crab traps hang from the dock, local children fish for striped bass, and harbor seals sun themselves on nearby rocks. At low tide, stroll over to Little Chebeague Island via sandbar. Come in summer and pick abundant wild blueberries until your fingers are stained purple.
Stay: Chebeague Island Inn has been thoughtfully restored to capture Maine’s commitment to fine craftsmanship. Stone fireplaces and local artwork give sense of place.

Texto completo: Police: Jessica Richards, 42, of New Portland, was taken by LifeFlight helicopter to be treated for a possible head injury and severe upper left arm injury.
BINGHAM — A woman was injured early Monday morning when her vehicle crossed the center line and collided with a fully-loaded tractor-trailer, police said.
Jessica Richards, 42, of New Portland, was driving north on Route 201 in Bingham around 1:25 a.m. when the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee she was driving veered into the opposite lane, according to Chief Deputy Michael Mitchell of the Somerset County Sheriff’s Office. The Jeep crashed into a tractor trailer truck that was hauling tree-length logs, heading south, Mitchell said.
Richards was taken by LifeFlight helicopter from the scene to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston to be treated for a possible head injury and severe upper left arm injury.
“Her current treatment and injury status is unknown at this time,” Mitchell said in a news release. “It is unknown if she was wearing a seatbelt. She was alone in her vehicle.”
The driver of the tractor trailer, Michel Langelier, 46, of Saint-Prosper, Quebec, was not injured.
The crash is under investigation by Deputy Tyler Lefreniere and he was assisted at the scene by Sgt. Ritchie Putnam, both of Somerset County Sheriff’s Office. Also assisting was Maine State Police, Bingham and Solon fire departments and Upper Kennebec Valley Ambulance Service.
The crash was reconstructed and forensically mapped by Deputy Brian Crater.

Texto completo: Angry Lobster Disc Golf will open for the first time Thursday, July 1, on property that was previously used as a tree nursery.
New disc golf course highlights sport’s growing popularity
FAIRFIELD — Angry Lobster Disc Golf has transformed a tree nursery into central Maine’s latest disc golf course. Owner and manager Mark Andre is eager to get players, new and old, out there to enjoy it.
“We’re really looking forward to having our first people come through and getting feedback from them,” he said. “I’m sure there’ll be some things that we want to do to improve the course after we get feedback. But that’s really kind of what we want the course to be about — we want this to be the golfers’ course, and we’re here to maintain and improve it.”
Disc golf popularity continues to grow in the region. Quarry Road Trails in Waterville recently announced they will open a disc golf course, and Quaker Hill Disc Golf in Fairfield has been around since 2003, where they have seen steadily increased popularity over the years.
The Angry Lobster course, located at 11 Ten Lots Road in Fairfield, opens Thursday and will be open from dawn until dusk. It costs $7 per round, or $10 per day, and visitors can pay at the pro shop, or there will be an honor drop box if the shop is closed.
The course features wooded areas left over from the property’s time as a tree nursery. It will eventually have 18 holes, but two are still under construction. The course includes longer distances than other courses in the area, to help attract more advanced players, said Harley Lance Cole, Andre’s business partner, who helped design the course.
Once open, Cole will oversee the pro shop at the disc gold course.
“My main goal with the course was to try to help and elevate the game here in the state of Maine,” Cole said. “We have a lot of short courses, and I feel like it almost limits the talent that we’re able to reach for. So the main goal was to open it up and really give players a chance to reach their full potential.”
They have scorecards for both amateur and advanced players, so the course is accessible to any skill level.
There are plans to have a shop on the property as well, which will sell all the gear a disc golfer could dream of. The shop will be open in a limited capacity for now, with a few sets of discs for visitors to rent.
The original plan was for the full shop to open with the course, Andre said, but the pandemic has disrupted the supply chain for gear. Many suppliers are having difficulty providing for current clients and are not taking on new customers.
“We would love to have it up and running this year, but with the pandemic and everything, it made it very hard to get on a dealer level with some of the companies,” Cole said. “They’re having trouble even supplying their own dealers already, so they’re not accepting new ones.”
The name comes from Andre’s time as a commercial lobster fisherman in the Florida Keys. When he was fishing, Andre would use a fiberglass stick to “tickle” the lobsters out of the holes they were in. One time when he brought his partner with, she remarked that the lobsters looked angry as they were tickled out.
Later, when Andre was working on boat repairs, she said he looked like one of the “angry lobsters.” The nickname stuck, and Andre said it felt like the perfect name for the course.
The disc golf course is the latest iteration in the long history of the property. It was originally part of a land grant from the English monarchy back in the 1700s and was a working farm for more than two centuries.
“It would have been a shame to see it go under for a housing development or some other use,” Andre said. “Having a disc golf course here is a nice way to preserve the property, and the land.”
Andre brought the property in 2004, and ran a tree nursery — Thornridge Farms Nursery — growing shade, ornamental and Christmas trees.
The nursery was a joint project with his brother, Andre said. And in the last several years as his brother’s health declined, the two stopped planting new trees and began phasing out the nursery, before officially closing in 2020.
Andre himself is fairly well-known in the area, as he ran several times for the House District 110 seat in the Maine State House of Representatives, and was involved with disputes with Colby College in Waterville about student voter registration and tax rates.
The idea for a disc golf course came from employees at the nursery, Andre said, who had often mentioned that the area would make a great course. So once the nursery closed last year, he began working on the course.
“It’s probably the biggest landscape project I’ve ever done,” Andre said. “It was actually a really fun thing to do to, to go through and lay the course out, start building the stone walls, and all the tee boxes — it was just a lot of fun to put this together, and rewarding. It’s kind of like a big art project.”
And the terrain was surprisingly suitable for the course. In working on the landscaping, they only had to remove a few of the younger trees.
“It’s just a beautiful piece of property,” Cole said, “and we just want to share it with everyone.”

Texto completo: Waterville, Hall-Dale girls won state titles after the 2020 was wiped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
First came the gratitude, and it never wore off. High school tennis players who missed out on a season when the 2020 schedule was canceled in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic were eager to get back on the courts, and eager to get back to normal and vie for championships.
“Tennis is my favorite sport. Even if we didn’t have a season, I was going to get girls together just to hit it around,” said Hall-Dale No. 1 singles player Naomi Lynch.
Unlike high school sports in fall and winter in Maine, which played shorter schedules against regional competition with no statewide playoffs, spring sports was a step back to normal, with state team championships and the traditional statewide singles tournament in tennis.
“Everybody was really anxious to get back,” Hall-Dale girls tennis coach Guy Cousins said. “There was just a lot of gratitude that we had a season. Everyone was so positive. It was a season we didn’t know we’d have.”
Cousins’ Bulldogs played the regular season in masks, following social distance and disinfection protocols.
“We played with masks on almost all season. We didn’t take them off until we got to the playoffs. We were doing everything we could. We saw other teams shut down (due to Covid-19) and we weren’t.”
Lynch and Savannah Millay led an inexperienced Hall-Dale team to its first state title with a win over Orono in the state championship match. In Class B, the Waterville girls capped an undefeated season with a win over Cape Elizabeth in the state championship. Despite missing the 2020 season, the Purple Panthers were able to build off success enjoyed in 2019.
“In 2019, we reached the regional final. That gave us a glimpse of that success,” Inga Zimba, Waterville’s first singles player, said. “Our team was excited to see hoe we’d do.”
The Waterville boys tennis team reached the state championship for the first time since 1998, when the Panthers won the Class A state title. Waterville fell in a close match to Yarmouth after defeating John Bapst, 3-2, in the Class B North regional championship match.
In Class C South, the Winthrop boys reached the Class C South finals before falling to juggernaut Waynflete, which went on to win its 13th consecutive state championship.
The 2021 season also was a season for individual achievement, with a handful of central Maine players enjoying success in the state singles tournament. Lynch advanced to the quarterfinals of the girls tournament. Zimba reached the round of 16. Sarah Trost of Maine Central Institute and Lindsey Bell of Gardiner each advanced to the second round.
In the boys tournament, Charlie Haberstock of Waterville and Dawson Turcotte of Skowhegan each reached the quarterfinals. Owen Evans of Waterville advanced to the second round.

Texto completo: Police: Jessica Richards, 42, of New Portland, was taken by LifeFlight helicopter to be treated for a possible head injury and severe upper left arm injury.
BINGHAM — A woman was injured early Monday morning when her vehicle crossed the center line and collided with a fully-loaded tractor-trailer, police said.
Jessica Richards, 42, of New Portland, was driving north on Route 201 in Bingham around 1:25 a.m. when the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee she was driving veered into the opposite lane, according to Chief Deputy Michael Mitchell of the Somerset County Sheriff’s Office. The Jeep crashed into a tractor trailer truck that was hauling tree-length logs, heading south, Mitchell said.
Richards was taken by LifeFlight helicopter from the scene to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston to be treated for a possible head injury and severe upper left arm injury.
“Her current treatment and injury status is unknown at this time,” Mitchell said in a news release. “It is unknown if she was wearing a seatbelt. She was alone in her vehicle.”
The driver of the tractor trailer, Michel Langelier, 46, of Saint-Prosper, Quebec, was not injured.
The crash is under investigation by Deputy Tyler Lefreniere and he was assisted at the scene by Sgt. Ritchie Putnam, both of Somerset County Sheriff’s Office. Also assisting was Maine State Police, Bingham and Solon fire departments and Upper Kennebec Valley Ambulance Service.
The crash was reconstructed and forensically mapped by Deputy Brian Crater.

MS/KJ: Bill banning flavored tobacco loses funding in state budget compromise

Texto completo: Law that would ban sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, could be in jeopardy as bipartisan budget deal fails to backfill tax revenue loss.
A bill that would ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, could be on its way to defeat in the Legislature as a bipartisan budget compromised brokered over the weekend excluded funding for the measure.
The tobacco legislation, which would cost the state about $32 million in lost sales tax revenue if approved, is among about 45 bills lawmakers will take up when they return to session Wednesday morning.
The Legislature will also take votes on 11 vetoes issued by Gov. Janet Mills in recent days, including one on a bill that would force the closure of the Long Creek Youth Development Center, the state’s only juvenile prison.
Also on deck is a bill that would move Maine toward a statewide vote on whether a new consumer-owned electric utility should be created to takeover Central Maine Power and Versant Power companies.
Mills, a Democrat, had signaled her support for the tobacco bill last month in a budget proposal that set aside $32 million in surplus revenue to cover the cost of the measure. But the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee cast a unanimous vote Sunday on a budget change package that excludes funding for the bill.
Supporters of the measure, including health advocates who work to keep kids from smoking and vaping, expressed their disappointment Tuesday.
“Tobacco has taken over our schools and our children’s lives,” Dr. Deborah Hagler, a Brunswick pediatrician and President of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a prepared statement issued by Flavors Hook Kids, a coalition supporting the bill. “Menthol, candy, and dessert flavors lure them, then nicotine gets them hooked.”
As both a doctor and a parent, Hagler said she was “astonished” by the committee vote. “Our kids are being relentlessly targeted by the tobacco industry, and lawmakers are doing nothing to protect them,” she said.
The American Lung Association also criticized the Legislature’s decision. The organization noted that the state has also reduced funding for tobacco prevention programs in the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention by $5 million.
“In the midst of a respiratory pandemic, worsened by tobacco use, this is a double blow to the long-term health of Mainers,” the association’s senior advocacy director, Lance Boucher, said in a written statement. “Today, Maine is failing to protect our children, including the one in three Maine high school students who currently use some form of tobacco.”
The bill, L.D. 1550, enjoyed bipartisan support at a hearing in May but has since faced opposition from organizations supportive of small businesses, especially convenience store owners, who derive some of their income from the sale of tobacco products.
Mills’ press secretary, Lindsay Crete, said Mills supports the budget deal reached by lawmakers and was unlikely to try to make line-by-line changes to it.
“The Governor is interested in garnering broad, bipartisan support for the budget, not in line iteming portions of it,” Crete wrote in an email. “She applauds the Appropriations Committee’s unanimous, bipartisan agreement, which she believes will make important, meaningful and historic progress for Maine people, including finally meeting the state’s obligation to fully fund education, increasing revenue sharing and property tax relief, and making health care, like dental care, more accessible.”
Crete also confirmed Mills fully supports a provision in the budget deal brokered by minority Republicans that will send a $300 payment to those who worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Maine.
“Many Maine people worked hard throughout the pandemic to keep our economy going, despite the risk to themselves and their families, and she believes they deserve recognition for their efforts,” Crete wrote. “She applauds Republicans and Democrats for coming together to create this provision.”
Crete also reiterated Mills’ concerns around the power company takeover bill. That measure failed enactment in the Senate by one vote earlier this month but could face additional votes, including on a recent amendment aimed at addressing concerns over lost property tax revenue. Crete said the last-minute move to amend the bill was more evidence the legislation needed more work.
“The unveiling of this amendment — one day prior to a vote on it, which also will be the same day the Legislature is scheduled to consider a host of serious matters, including the budget — leaves little time for serious public consideration and feedback and simply underscores one of the Governor’s primary concerns: that proponents of the legislation are attempting to too quickly advance a bill that would have massive implications for the state without having addressed its serious questions in a robust way,” Crete wrote.
“(Gov. Mills) is sympathetic to the concerns about Maine’s utilities, but she continues to believe that this bill presents a rosy solution to a complicated problem and, if advanced, would create more problems than it actually solves.”
Also on Mills’ desk is a bill that would allow the four Native American tribes in Maine to open casinos on tribal lands. For decades the tribes have worked to regain gambling rights allowed to them under federal law but denied to them under a law that settled a land dispute between the tribes and the state in 1980.
Crete said Mills’ office would likely be announcing additional bills she had signed into law or vetoed over the next 48 hours, but she did not offer any specifics.
Both the state House and Senate are expected to convene at 10 a.m. Wednesday.

Texto completo: A bill that would ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, could be on its way to defeat in the Legislature as a bipartisan budget compromise brokered over the weekend excluded funding for the measure.
The tobacco legislation, which would cost the state about $32 million in lost sales tax revenue if approved, is among about 45 bills lawmakers will take up when they return to session Wednesday morning.
The Legislature also will take votes on 11 vetoes issued by Gov. Janet Mills in recent days, including on a bill that would force the closure of the Long Creek Youth Development Center, the state's only juvenile prison.
Also on deck is a bill that would move Maine toward a statewide vote on whether a new consumer-owned electric utility should be created to takeover Central Maine Power and Versant Power companies.
Mills, a Democrat, had signaled her support for the tobacco bill last month in a budget proposal that set aside $32 million in surplus revenue to cover the cost of the measure. But the Legislature's Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee cast a unanimous vote Sunday on a budget change package that excludes funding for the bill.
Supporters of the measure, including health advocates who work to keep kids from smoking and vaping, expressed their disappointment Tuesday.
"Tobacco has taken over our schools and our children's lives," Dr. Deborah Hagler, a Brunswick pediatrician and president of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a prepared statement issued by Flavors Hook Kids, a coalition supporting the bill. "Menthol, candy and dessert flavors lure them, then nicotine gets them hooked."
'kids ... relentlessly targeted'
As both a doctor and a parent, Hagler said she was "astonished" by the committee vote. "Our kids are being relentlessly targeted by the tobacco industry, and lawmakers are doing nothing to protect them," she said.
The American Lung Association also criticized the Legislature's decision. The organization noted that the state also has reduced funding for tobacco prevention programs in the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention by $5 million.
"In the midst of a respiratory pandemic, worsened by tobacco use, this is a double blow to the long-term health of Mainers," the association's senior advocacy director, Lance Boucher, said in a written statement. "Today, Maine is failing to protect our children, including the one in three Maine high school students who currently use some form of tobacco."
The bill, L.D. 1550, enjoyed bipartisan support at a hearing in May but has since faced opposition from organizations that support small businesses, especially convenience store owners, who derive some of their income from the sale of tobacco products.
Mills' spokeswoman, Lindsay Crete, said the governor supports the budget deal reached by lawmakers and was unlikely to try to make line-by-line changes to it.
"The governor is interested in garnering broad, bipartisan support for the budget, not in line-iteming portions of it," Crete wrote in an email. "She applauds the Appropriations Committee's unanimous, bipartisan agreement, which she believes will make important, meaningful and historic progress for Maine people, including finally meeting the state's obligation to fully fund education, increasing revenue sharing and property tax relief, and making health care, like dental care, more accessible."
Mills supports $300 payment
Crete also confirmed that Mills fully supports a provision in the budget deal brokered by minority Republicans that will send a $300 payment to those who worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Maine.
"Many Maine people worked hard throughout the pandemic to keep our economy going despite the risk to themselves and their families, and she believes they deserve recognition for their efforts," Crete wrote. "She applauds Republicans and Democrats for coming together to create this provision."
Crete also reiterated Mills' concerns around the power company takeover bill. That measure failed enactment in the Senate by one vote this month but could face additional votes, including on a recent amendment aimed at addressing concerns over lost property tax revenue. Crete said the last-minute move to amend the bill was more evidence the legislation needed more work.
"The unveiling of this amendment - one day prior to a vote on it, which also will be the same day the Legislature is scheduled to consider a host of serious matters, including the budget - leaves little time for serious public consideration and feedback and simply underscores one of the governor's primary concerns: that proponents of the legislation are attempting to too quickly advance a bill that would have massive implications for the state without having addressed its serious questions in a robust way," Crete wrote.
"(Gov. Mills) is sympathetic to the concerns about Maine's utilities, but she continues to believe that this bill presents a rosy solution to a complicated problem and, if advanced, would create more problems than it actually solves."
Also on Mills' desk is a bill that would allow the four Native American tribes in Maine to open casinos on tribal lands.

Mariners expected to become Bruins affiliate Portland's hockey team is expected to make an announcement today, a day after the news broke that the New York Rangers are out.

Texto completo: The Maine Mariners are expected to announce Wednesday that they are becoming an affiliate of the Boston Bruins.
The Press Herald confirmed the Bruins' affiliation Tuesday afternoon, hours before news broke that the New York Rangers are out as the affiliate of Portland's minor-league hockey team.
The Mariners had scheduled an affiliation announcement Wednesday morning at Cross Insurance Arena, and all signs point to the Bruins completing the trifecta of partnerships between professional sports teams in Greater Portland and their parent clubs in Boston.
The Sea Dogs are Double-A baseball partners of the Red Sox. The Red Claws recently changed their name to the Maine Celtics to better reflect their basketball relationship with the Boston Celtics.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Jacksonville Icemen announced a change in their ECHL affiliation from the Winnipeg Jets to the Rangers.
Nobody with the Mariners would publicly confirm the new partnership Tuesday. But when given the opportunity to deny that the Mariners would become a Bruins affiliate, two officials of the team declined to do so.
Since 2015, the Atlanta Gladiators have been the Bruins' ECHL affiliate. Based in Duluth, Georgia, the Gladiators halted play in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, as did the Mariners.
'it will help attract more fans'
The Mariners first hit the ice in Portland in 2018 as a Rangers affiliate and remained so through the 2019-20 season, which was cut short with the team on the verge of its first playoff run. Montreal also sent an occasional prospect to Portland, as did a few other NHL organizations without ECHL affiliates.
The original Maine Mariners played in the American Hockey League, one step above the ECHL, and were affiliated with the Philadelphia Flyers from 1977 to 1983, the New Jersey Devils until 1987, and (as an expansion franchise) the Boston Bruins until 1992. The franchise subsequently moved to Rhode Island to become the Providence Bruins.
By adding the Mariners as an ECHL partner, the Boston Bruins would have their top two farm clubs within an easy drive of TD Garden.
Adam Goldberg, vice president of business operations for the Mariners, would not confirm the Bruins' affiliation but had this to say about Wednesday's announcement: "I think the fan base will be excited. I think the media will be excited. It makes a lot of sense for us."
Chris Roy, a season-ticket holder from South Portland, said a Mariners-Bruins partnership makes a lot of sense from a marketing standpoint.
"I think it will help attract more fans into the arena, and at the end of the day that's the game," he said. "From what I know of the Bruins' minor league affiliate at the ECHL level, I don't see a ton of prospects, but the Mariners filled out their own roster."
'this area loves the bruins'
Scott Prue of North Waterboro has been a season-ticket holder since the AHL Portland Pirates played at what was then the Cumberland County Civic Center. Although he grew up in Maine, he was never a Bruins fan. Grudgingly, he said he would change.
"I'm not going to like it, but I'll do it," he said.
Prue said he has been hearing talk for months about the Mariners becoming affiliated with the Bruins.
"We're going with the Bruins," he said assuredly. "And you'll see an increase in attendance with having the Bruins there. There's no doubt about it."
Andrew Hart of South Portland, another season-ticket holder, sides with Prue.
"Let's be honest, this area loves the Bruins, so the Bruins coming in is going to be good for business," he said. "And whatever helps put people into the building is always going to be a plus, no matter what my feelings are about the Bruins' organization."
Hart said he figured Wednesday's announcement alone would result in another few hundred season tickets being sold. Coming on the heels of a pandemic-forced year without hockey, he said a new partnership would be "a refreshing start to a restart of the Mariners' operation."

Case of rare tick-borne illness reported in Maine
One person in Maine has contracted the Powassan virus, a rare tickborne disease, and the first case in the state this year.
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday that a Waldo County resident was hospitalized for the virus, and is now recovering at home.
"Cases of Powassan are rare in the United States, with about 25 cases reported each year since 2015," according to a Maine CDC news release. "Maine has identified nine cases since 2010. Humans become infected with Powassan through the bite of an infected deer tick or woodchuck tick."
Symptoms of Powassan virus include fever, headache, fatigue, vomiting, memory loss, and in severe cases, brain infections.
Deer ticks also transmit Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis and other diseases.
AUBURN
Two Massachusetts fugitives arrested
Two men wanted in Massachusetts were arrested Tuesday in Auburn on charges stemming from a weekend car crash involving an injured state trooper.
The U.S. Marshals Service tracked down Luis Gonzales, 29, and Andy Escarfuller, 22, at a home in Auburn about 9:45 a.m. after a leaving the scene of a crash in Massachusetts on Saturday in which a state trooper was injured, according to Deputy U.S. Marshal Ryan Guay.
Gonzales was arrested on Massachusetts warrants charging assault and battery with a deadly weapon, negligent operation, leaving the scene of a personal injury accident and other charges connected to the crash.
Escarfuller was arrested on a Massachusetts warrant charging child rape, Guay wrote in a media statement.
Gonzales had reportedly been driving a vehicle involved in a hit-and-run crash. Shortly afterward, Massachusetts State Police found him and the vehicle he had been driving, Guay wrote.
As police sought to apprehend Gonzales, the vehicle he was driving reportedly crashed head-on into a Massachusetts State Police vehicle. He backed up, then while trying to flee the scene, intentionally struck a trooper who was outside his cruiser, Guay wrote.
Escarfuller was apparently a passenger in the vehicle reportedly driven by Gonzales, Guay wrote.
The Massachusetts State Police Violent Fugitive Apprehension Section, Maine State Police and U.S. Marshals Service developed information that Gonzales had fled to a home in Auburn. U.S. Marshal Service Task Force members arrested Gonzales on Tuesday in a stolen from Massachusetts and found at the Auburn home.
Escarfuller also was at the home and was arrested.
Both men were taken to Androscoggin County Jail on fugitive from justice charges pending extradition to Massachusetts, Guay wrote.
PLYMOUTH, Mass.
Man charged with murder in father's death
A Massachusetts man charged with murder in the death of his father told police he was exorcising a demon and performing a baptism when he dunked his father's head in a shallow pond, prosecutors said in court Tuesday.
Jack Callahan, 19, of Duxbury, was held without bail after a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf at his arraignment.
Callahan is charged with killing Scott Callahan, 57, whose body was recovered from Island Creek Pond in Duxbury early Monday.
Plymouth Assistant District Attorney Shanan Buckingham said in court father and son had taken an Uber to the pond from Boston.
The younger man was at first trying to help his father, who had left a treatment center where he was being treated for alcohol abuse, Buckingham said.
The son dunked his father's head under water several times until he stopped struggling, the prosecutor said.
The younger man's attorney, Kevin Reddington, called his client a "very nice young man" with no criminal record and asked the judge to send him for a competency evaluation, which the judge denied.
Reddington said Callahan was suffering from a mental health issue.
BARNSTABLE, Mass.
Man denies destroying $12,000 worth of lobster
A man is facing charges connected to destroying thousands of dollars worth of live lobsters at a Massachusetts seafood market.
Joseph A. Vaudo pleaded not guilty to charges of vandalizing property and using another's commercial dumpster at Superior Lobster & Seafood in Sandwich on Monday, the Cape Cod Times reported.
Vaudo's bail was set at $1,000 and a judge instructed him to keep away from staff and the business.
Police records showed that Vaudo was the previous owner of Superior Lobster & Seafood when it was Mr. Vaudo's Fish Market.
According to the police report, Vaudo allegedly destroyed between $8,000 to $12,000 worth of lobsters.
Video footage obtained by police showed Vaudo arriving at the property on Thursday evening. Police described Vaudo retrieving garbage bags from his truck and disposing them in the dumpster at the market, and then turning off the power boxes.
The store manager told police that when he arrived to the market Friday morning, he noticed the power boxes that kept the live seafood tank circulating were turned off. The manager turned the power back on but the lobsters were "stressed beyond normal" because of the lack of oxygen and water circulation, the newspaper reported.
CONCORD, N.H.
Court hears bail case for driver in crash that killed 7
A truck driver charged with causing the deaths of seven motorcyclists in 2019 deserves a bail hearing despite a judge's ruling that he should remain jailed, a defense attorney argued before the New Hampshire Supreme Court on Tuesday.
Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 25, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, has been in jail since the crash happened in Randolph on June 21, 2019. He pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of negligent homicide, manslaughter, driving under the influence and reckless conduct. His trial is scheduled to start on Nov. 29.
His lawyers asked a judge for a bail hearing twice in 2020 and again in April. The judge denied the requests, agreeing with the state that Zhukovskyy is a danger to himself and others.
Christopher Johnson, appellate defender, said among the issues in dispute are statements Zhukovskyy made to police after the collision; the degree and extent of Zhukovskyy's impairment that day; the amount of reaction time available when the motorcyclists and Zhukovskyy came into each other's field of vision; whether Zhukovskyy did react by braking; and his lane location.
Johnson added that Zhukovskky has maintained his sobriety while he has been jailed for the last two years.
Johnson also said the state, in its written arguments supporting the judge's decision, relied on part of a statute that says people on probation have a right to a bail hearing. He said he didn't think the Legislature would need to make that right explicit in the law for people who are not on probation.

Texto completo: Crispy Gai, which has been operating out of the Public Market House in Portland, will open in its new location on Wednesday.
The restaurant - which sells take-out Thai-spiced fried chicken, chicken sandwiches and Thai-inspired salads - has moved to 90 Exchange St., the former home of Eaux. Jordan Rubin, who co-owns the business with Cyle Reynolds, said Crispy Gai will be open from 4 to 10 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays to start. Eventually, they plan to add lunch and late-night hours.
Rubin also owns the popular sushi bar Mr. Tuna in the Public Market House.
Knife store moves, a wee bit
Strata, the culinary knife store on Washington Avenue in Portland, has opened in its new, expanded location.
Owner Evan Atwell moved Strata from its original spot in one of the pocket-size shipping containers used by budding entrepreneurs to start small businesses, into a nearby storefront at 67 Washington Ave., the former Nissan Bakery building. The new location includes an impressive-looking knife display on one wall.
Hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. The store is closed Mondays and Tuesdays.
Presto change-o
When Peter and Orenda Hale made a surprise announcement earlier this month that they would be closing their new Portland restaurant, Pigeons, at 59 Washington Ave., they said they'd use the space instead to expand Maine & Loire, their adjacent wine shop. The shop/wine bar reopened this week with the new layout, and on Wednesday the Hales will host their first tasting in 17 months. The tasting, which features French picnic wines and runs from from 4 to 6 p.m., is free.
Bam Bam, one of these days
I've received a few emails from readers who are wondering when Bam Bam, a gluten-free bakery in Portland, will return. Owner Tina Cromwell closed the Commercial Street bakery last year, with plans to open in a larger space in East Bayside this spring. Cromwell recently told me that the East Bayside location has fallen through. She has her eye on another location but didn't want to divulge it just yet.
Limbo
Morse's Sauerkraut in Waldoboro closed its small restaurant during the pandemic, and it seems unlikely it will open again anytime soon - at least not in the same form.
Chef and co-owner Cody LaMontagne told me she wasn't yet ready to discuss her new plans. Meanwhile, if you are craving, say, a pastrami and swiss on rye (with kraut, of course), the popular Maine store is still selling grab-and-go sandwiches and prepared foods to take home. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays.
New Tiqa team
Tiqa, at 327 Commercial St. in Portland, has a new team in the kitchen: Emil Rivera, formerly of Sur Lie, is executive chef; Siddharta Rumma is chef de cuisine; and Seth Pelletier is sous chef. Look for the restaurant's new summer menu at tiqa.net.
Raise a glass to Hayley
Hayley Wilson, a bartender at Portland Hunt & Alpine Club, has been named to Punch Magazine's Bartender in Residence Class of 2021, a designation that honors bartenders who are considered to be a force in the future of the industry. In an article about Wilson, Briana Volk, co-owner of Hunt & Alpine, is quoted describing Wilson's style as "pulling from the classics but adding a kind of punk-meets-tropical edge."
follow in mom's footsteps?
Just think of it as the hipper version of a lemonade stand. Three 14-year-olds have launched a yakisoba stand behind Suzuki's Sushi Bar at 419 Main St. in Rockland to earn money for college.
Dylan Winslow, Gil Stewart and Takuma Suzuki Steinberger - who will be freshmen at Oceanside High School in the fall - got permission from the Rockland City Council to sell Japanese street food in the small park behind the sushi bar, which is owned by Steinberger's mother, Keiko Suzuki Steinberger. They'll be selling their take on yakisoba - noodles cooked on a griddle with pork or tofu, cabbage, onions, bean sprouts and carrots - to customers relaxing at picnic tables in the park on weekend evenings.
The food stand will open at 5:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays this summer. Access is from the parking lot on the water side of Main Street.
Persian nights
Louisa Shafia, author of "The New Persian Kitchen" (Ten Speed Press, $24.99), will teach two hands-on cooking classes in August at Nina June in Rockport.
Shafia will talk about Iranian cuisine and show participants how to make one of the country's most famous dishes - tahdig, the crunchy rice at the bottom of the pot. The class will create a tableful of dishes in Nina June's large open kitchen, then sit down with Shafia to eat in the dining room. Copies of Shafia's book will be available, along with her Persian Spice Set, made up of 11 spices essential for Iranian cooking. The classes will be held from 4 to 7 p.m. Aug. 15 and 16.
Help with hiring
Hospitality Maine has handed out $23,000 in grants this month to help restaurants and inns hire staff during this season of worker shortages. Forty-six businesses were chosen at random from participants of the Great Maine Comeback and ReUp ME campaigns that the association developed with O'Maine Studios last year to help struggling hospitality businesses stay afloat during the pandemic. Each grant is $500.
Help the hungry
The St. Hildegard Food Pantry Recipe Challenge has begun accepting recipes for this year's contest.
The challenge, sponsored by Catholic Charities Maine's Parish Social Ministry, supports parish food pantries, soup kitchens and other food-based ministries. Winners get a cash donation for their parish's food programs.
This year's challenge is based on the Food Network show "Chopped." The theme is Food Box + 1. What does that mean? To create a recipe, entrants can only use ingredients that would be found in a food pantry box destined for a family of four: cereal, crackers, powdered milk, canned soup, dried fruit, nuts, chickpeas, beans, instant potatoes, bread, canned vegetables, canned fruit, pork, chicken, beef, whole milk, butter, yogurt, sour cream, seasonal fresh vegetables and basic fruits. (Presumably that means no kiwi or star fruit.) One additional ingredient is allowed, but it must be something that's available at a local food pantry. Recipes must be main dishes or side dishes, and will be judged on nutritional value and ease of cooking.
Entries will be accepted through Aug. 22, and winners announced on Sept. 17, the Feast Day of St. Hildegard. Email recipes to psm@ccmaine.org with "Recipe Contest" in the subject line, or send them via snail mail to Recipe Contest, Catholic Charities Maine, P.O. Box 10660, Portland, ME 04104.
The Deering Center Community Church Food Pantry needs re-stocking. Items needed include peanut butter and jelly, spaghetti and spaghetti sauce, baked beans, cereal, juice, tuna and snacks. No canned vegetables, please. Pastor Don Drake tells me they use the peanut butter and jelly to make sandwiches for the homeless. Call (207) 773-2423 or email pastordon@deeringcenter.org with any questions.

Texto completo: A woman has pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection with a sex trafficking operation that stretched from China to Maine.
Derong Miao appeared in U.S. District Court in Portland on Tuesday. She and her husband, Shou Chao Li, were both indicted on a host of charges in 2018. Among other things, Miao admitted that she and her husband rented two properties in Portland that were used for commercial sex, and she helped organize the transportation of four separate women between New Hampshire and Maine for prostitution.
She pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in interstate transportation and travel for prostitution, as well as four counts of interstate transportation for prostitution. She also agreed to forfeit $2,000 to the federal government. The prosecutor agreed to dismiss two counts of sex trafficking by fraud or coercion, and one count of interstate transportation for prostitution.
A sentencing hearing has not yet been scheduled, but Miao agreed not to appeal any sentence that is less than four years and nine months. The conspiracy charge carries a possible penalty of five years in prison; the interstate transportation charges, up to 10 years each.
Miao is a Chinese citizen, and her conviction could have implications on her residency in the United States. She was 37 years old when she was arrested in 2018. Court documents filed so far contain few other details about her life, but the sentencing could bring forth other facts about her.
Li still faces the same charges, plus one count of possessing a victim's passport as part of the trafficking scheme. He has not pleaded guilty, and his case could go to trial as soon as August. His lawyer did not respond to an email or a voicemail Tuesday.
Attorney Jeffrey Langholtz, who represented Miao, did not answer a question about whether she would testify against her husband at a trial and said after the hearing that he did not have any comment on the case.
Both Miao and Li have been in federal custody since their arrests. Miao, who is held at the Cumberland County Jail, stood quietly next to her attorney during the hearing. U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby asked her a series of questions, including whether she received translated copies of the documents in her case and whether she understood her right to a trial. Miao answered through a Chinese interpreter, saying, "Yes, your honor," and "I understand, your honor."
Court documents do not identify any of the women who were exploited as part of the trafficking operation or say what happened to them after Miao and Li were arrested. None attended the court hearing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee said after the hearing that she could not answer questions from a reporter, including one about what happened to the women.
A 2015 assessment published by the Maine Sex Trafficking and Exploitation Network estimated that there are 300 to 400 victims of sex trafficking in Maine every year.
As part of her plea agreement, Miao agreed not to contest certain facts in a narrative filed last week by the government. That document mentions other conspirators but names only Li, and it describes activities that took place in 2016 and 2017.
The government says Miao and her husband were living in New Hampshire when they participated in the trafficking scheme. They leased four residential properties, including two in Portland, that were used for prostitution. Miao allegedly used a social media platform called WeChat to talk to Chinese women about engaging in prostitution in New Hampshire and Maine. The document says the women had mostly come to the United States on visas that did not legally allow them to work, and they hoped to find other jobs but were unable to repay debts associated with their travel. They spoke little or no English and had no other contacts in Maine or neighboring states.
The government says Miao and her husband "benefited financially" from the scheme, and they also made payments to unnamed conspirators. Miao helped with transportation and other logistics needed to bring the women to New England from other states, and she and her husband allegedly moved the women between hotels in the Portland area to avoid detection. Miao also stayed in contact with the women through WeChat "about location changes and the collection of prostitution proceeds." The document ties her to four separate women.
"Beginning on about August 18, 2016, and continuing until at least October 30, 2017, on at least 33 occasions, the defendant and her husband leased, rented, or agreed to pay for the cost of identified locations (houses of prostitution or hotel rooms) in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont where identified Chinese females were actual or registered guests," the document says.
Langholtz told the judge Miao did not remember the exact number of occasions, but she believed it to be less than 33. The attorneys said they agreed to disagree on that point in the record.

Health officials search for key to boosting vaccination numbers

Texto completo: The state and health care providers will try new approaches and settings for inoculating people.

Health officials and medical providers are exploring next steps in Maine’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign as plummeting demand for shots means it could be months before the state achieves widespread inoculation — if it ever does.
Maine continues to have among the highest vaccination rates in the nation alongside its New England neighbors. Yet the pace of vaccinations in Maine has slowed to the point where the total vaccine doses administered in Maine for all of last week — roughly 8,500 — was one half to one-third of the number delivered on many single days in April and May.
At the current pace, it would take another four months to achieve a vaccination rate of 75 percent of the state’s 1.3 million residents, according to tracking and projections by Bloomberg. Vermont, on the other hand, could hit that target in one month while Massachusetts and Connecticut could reach 75 percent within two months, according to the estimates.
Faced with softening — even cratering — demand, officials with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the state’s health care networks are conducting a “deep dive” to better understand who has yet to be vaccinated, the reasons why and how best to reach them.
“My goal for the next phase of vaccination, if I had to summarize it, it is going to be typified by removing barriers: removing barriers for people who want to get vaccinated, for doctor’s offices who want to order vaccine, so on and so forth,” said Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah.
Gone are the days of mass vaccination clinics. Instead, a growing number of primary care physicians are offering vaccinations in more personal, private settings for those who have opted not to take advantage of the no-appointment, walk-in jabs available for months at retail pharmacies and hospital clinics statewide.
Summer is fair and festival season in Maine, and Mainers can expect to see vaccination stations offered at some — but not all — of the popular events that are returning this year after a 2020 without funnel cakes, pig racing and live music.
At the North Atlantic Blues Festival, which returns to the Rockland waterfront on July 10-11, free vaccines will be available from 6:30-10 p.m. during Saturday evening’s “Club Crawl” near the park on Main Street. Rockland’s main drag is closed to traffic and the public is allowed to stroll the music-filled street for free during the crawl.
Festival organizer Paul Benjamin said he worked with city and county leaders to set up the vaccination station, which will offer both the “one and done” shot produced by Johnson & Johnson as well as the first shot of Pfizer for anyone 12 or over. Those who do will also receive a free book and DVD about the blues festival.
“There are probably 4,000 to 5,000 people down there,” Benjamin said of the free Saturday night portion of the festival. “There are a lot of families so we decided it would be a great place to offer COVID shots.”
Officials with the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry also plan to talk about the issue with representatives of Maine’s more than 20 agricultural fairs. Those fairs, which kicked off this month in Monmouth, draw hundreds of thousands of visitors, many from rural areas where vaccination rates are considerable lower than in southern and coastal Maine.
Leon Brillant, president of the Topsham Fair, said organizers met recently with representatives of Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick. Although details have yet to be ironed out for the fair, which takes place August 10-15, Brillant said he was “pretty sure we will do something” for the event, which typically pulls in 28,000 to 30,000 spectators.
“We want to do it,” Brillant said. “It’s a good thing.”
For health care providers, this next phase of the vaccination campaign will be about “trying everything — like throwing spaghetti against the wall,” said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth. While that spaghetti won’t always stick, Mills said, even the less-fruitful ventures can be educational.
For instance, MaineHealth vaccinated a total of 20 people during two recent Summer Sunsets Live music events that drew about 1,000 people each night to Thompson’s Point in Portland. MaineHealth’s trailer was located in a high-traffic area and well promoted throughout an event that catered to a younger crowd that likely included include a fair number of unvaccinated people, based on Maine CDC age data.
“We were the only place without a line,” Mills said with a laugh.
Mills, who is a former Maine CDC director and the sister of Gov. Janet Mills, said as she watched the crowd of mostly young people she realized not many would be interested in peeling off from their group to sit for a shot, plus the 15-minute post-jab monitoring period. And she couldn’t blame them, given the social aspect of the evening.
“It wasn’t a mistake and I’m glad we did it,” Mills said. “We did learn some good lessons — like maybe a concert is not the best venue.”
Instead, MaineHealth has found more success staging pop-up clinics at breweries and other businesses in both the Portland area as well as parts of the state with lower vaccination rates. Mills said in these smaller venues, people may be more likely to at least stop by the table to ask questions about the vaccines even if they don’t necessarily get the shot that day.
Likewise, Northern Light Homecare and Hospice is working with businesses and event organizers to stage pop-up clinics around the state. Recent events have been held at speedways, an ice cream shop, a seafood shack, the Bangor Pride observances, a recovery center and a YMCA.
Northern Light spokeswoman Karen Cashman said the network is also working with EMS agencies and other partners to vaccinate homebound individuals around the state as well as to hold clinics for homeless individuals through a program organized by the South Portland Fire Department.
“We look forward to continuing to serve our community by making vaccines available to all who want to be vaccinated,” Cashman said. “Moving forward, Northern Light Health’s focus is offering COVID-19 vaccinations in more personalized, localized, and easily accessible settings such as primary care offices, walk-in care, women’s health, pediatrics, as well as smaller clinic settings to help underserved communities.”
While the numbers are small compared to the large-scale clinics during the spring, event organizers say it is progress nonetheless. About 20 people took advantage of a vaccination event at the June 10 Portland Sea Dogs game, for instance, and received free food as well as a free ticket to a future game.
Geoff Iacuessa, president and general manager of the Sea Dogs, said the staff from Northern Light’s Mercy Hospital told him that “20 is better than zero and every little bit helps.”
“We are hoping to do at least one more prior to the end of the season but really we are open to doing as many as they want to do,” Iacuessa said. “They did all of the heavy lifting. We just provided the room to them.”
Shah, the Maine CDC director, said his agency is working closely with doctor’s offices to help them get vaccine doses. Whereas in the past groups of primary care offices had to commit to doing 1,000 doses a week because of scant supplies of vaccine, now Maine CDC is able to ship as few as 20 doses a week to offices that request them.
Shah said the Maine CDC also will be analyzing data, conducting surveys and potentially holding focus groups to get a better sense of who in Maine is still unvaccinated and why. Speaking during last week’s briefing, Shah said there are still barriers that have discouraged or prevented some Mainers from getting a shot and he is committed to helping remove those obstacles.
“In rural counties it may be ideological,” Shah said. “In other places, it may be social determinants: getting time off of work, having transportation, making hours for vaccination sites work for them. Time will tell. It will be an empirical question as much as anything else.”

Texto completo: Portland's hockey team is making an affiliation announcement Wednesday, a day after news broke that the Rangers are out.
The Maine Mariners are expected to announce Wednesday that they are becoming an affiliate of the Boston Bruins.
The Press Herald confirmed the Bruins affiliation Tuesday afternoon, hours before news broke that the New York Rangers are out as the affiliate of Portland’s minor-league hockey team.
The Mariners had scheduled an affiliation announcement Wednesday morning at Cross Insurance Arena, and all signs point to the Bruins completing the trifecta of partnerships between professional sports teams in Greater Portland and their parent clubs in Boston.
The Sea Dogs are Double-A baseball partners of the Red Sox. The Red Claws recently changed their name to the Maine Celtics to better reflect their basketball relationship with the Boston Celtics.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Jacksonville Icemen announced a change in their ECHL affiliation from the Winnipeg Jets to the Rangers.
Nobody with the Mariners would publicly confirm the new partnership Tuesday. But when given the opportunity to deny that the Mariners would become a Bruins affiliate, two officials of the team declined to do so.
Since 2015, the Atlantic Gladiators have been the Bruins’ ECHL affiliate. Based in Duluth, Georgia, the Gladiators halted play in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, as did the Mariners.
The Mariners first hit the ice in Portland in 2018 as a Rangers affiliate and remained so through the 2019-20 season, which was cut short with the team on the verge of its first playoff run. Montreal also sent an occasional prospect to Portland, as did a few other NHL organizations without ECHL affiliates.
The original Maine Mariners played in the American Hockey League, one step above the ECHL, and were affiliated with the Philadelphia Flyers from 1977 to 1983, the New Jersey Devils until 1987, and (as an expansion franchise) the Boston Bruins until 1992. The franchise subsequently moved to Rhode Island to become the Providence Bruins.
By adding the Mariners as an ECHL partner, the Boston Bruins would have their top two farm clubs within an easy drive of TD Garden.
Adam Goldberg, vice president of business operations for the Mariners, would not confirm the Bruins affiliation but had this to say about Wednesday’s announcement: “I think the fan base will be excited. I think the media will be excited. It makes a lot of sense for us.”
Chris Roy, a season ticket holder from South Portland, said a Mariners-Bruins partnership makes a lot of sense from a marketing standpoint.
“I think it will help attract more fans into the arena, and at the end of the day that’s the game,” he said. “From what I know of the Bruins’ minor league affiliate at the ECHL level, I don’t see a ton of prospects, but the Mariners filled out their own roster.”
Scott Prue of North Waterboro has been a season-ticket holder since the AHL Portland Pirates skated at what was then the Cumberland County Civic Center. Although he grew up in Maine, he was never a Bruins fan. Grudgingly, he said he would change.
“I’m not going to like it, but I’ll do it,” he said.
Prue said he has been hearing talk for months about the Mariners switching affiliations to the Bruins.
“We’re going with the Bruins,” he said assuredly. “And you’ll see an increase in attendance with having the Bruins there. There’s no doubt about it.”

Texto completo: Police: Justin Cardelli, 41, was arrested last Wednesday after he refused to stop for a warden in Waterville and eventually fled with a female passenger into the woods off Trafton Road, before a Maine State Police canine tracked him down and bit him on the leg.
A Portland man is expected to remain behind bars until his court appearance in August after he reportedly led a game warden and Maine State Police on a chase last week through Waterville.
Justin Cardelli, 41, eventually fled into the woods, where he was tracked down by a state police dog that bit him on the leg, according to police.
Cardelli was arrested last Wednesday by Maine Game Warden Sgt. Terry Hughes and charged with eluding an officer and reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon, because he caused a vehicle crash in Waterville during the chase, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife.
Hughes was on Kennedy Memorial Drive in Waterville at about 10:30 a.m. on June 23 when he saw a blue Chevrolet pickup truck being operated somewhat erratically, according to Latti. Hughes followed the truck down Silver Street and then Elm Street, where it cut off other vehicles, according to reports.
Hughes then attempted to stop the pickup truck, which was occupied by two people, but the vehicle kept going, Latti said.
Hughes pursued the truck for more than 3 miles, according to Latti.
“(Hughes) terminated the chase due to public safety concerns,” Latti said. “He lost contact and the vehicle kept moving but Fairfield police saw it go on Interstate 95, going south.
“As it was going south, Somerset County dispatch received numerous 911 calls about that same vehicle operating dangerously. State police set up various checkpoints to stop the truck, but the vehicle pulled over on the interstate, between Webb Road and Trafton Road, and stopped.”
The man who was driving the pickup truck, later identified as Cardelli, and a woman passenger got out and flagged down a tractor-trailer, which stopped, and the pair jumped in, Latti said.
The tractor-trailer attempted to drive away, but a state trooper pulled up behind it and the man and woman jumped out of the tractor-trailer and fled into the woods, according to Latti.
As state police pursued the pair into the woods, the woman walked out on her own and onto Trafton Road, where she was taken into custody, Latti said.
A state trooper with a trained dog tracked the man into the woods, according to Latti. The dog located the suspect and bit him on the leg. State police then arrested the man.
“He was taken to MaineGeneral in Augusta,” Latti said, “where he was treated and (then) brought to the Kennebec County jail.”
When arrested, Cardelli had three warrants for his arrest that included no bail, and he was on probation, according to Latti.
Police reportedly found narcotics in the pickup truck, and there is possibility further charges will be filed, either by state police or through the Kennebec County District Attorney’s Office, according to Latti.
Cardelli, who is being held without bail, is scheduled to appear Aug. 2 at the Capital Judicial Center in Augusta.
As of Tuesday, the woman with Cardelli had not been charged, according to Latti.

Texto completo: Waterville, Hall-Dale girls won state titles after the 2020 was wiped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
First came the gratitude, and it never wore off. High school tennis players who missed out on a season when the 2020 schedule was canceled in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic were eager to get back on the courts, and eager to get back to normal and vie for championships.
“Tennis is my favorite sport. Even if we didn’t have a season, I was going to get girls together just to hit it around,” said Hall-Dale No. 1 singles player Naomi Lynch.
Unlike high school sports in fall and winter in Maine, which played shorter schedules against regional competition with no statewide playoffs, spring sports was a step back to normal, with state team championships and the traditional statewide singles tournament in tennis.
“Everybody was really anxious to get back,” Hall-Dale girls tennis coach Guy Cousins said. “There was just a lot of gratitude that we had a season. Everyone was so positive. It was a season we didn’t know we’d have.”
Cousins’ Bulldogs played the regular season in masks, following social distance and disinfection protocols.
“We played with masks on almost all season. We didn’t take them off until we got to the playoffs. We were doing everything we could. We saw other teams shut down (due to Covid-19) and we weren’t.”
Lynch and Savannah Millay led an inexperienced Hall-Dale team to its first state title with a win over Orono in the state championship match.
In Class B, the Waterville girls capped an undefeated season with a win over Cape Elizabeth in the state championship.
Despite missing the 2020 season, the Purple Panthers were able to build off success enjoyed in 2019.
“In 2019, we reached the regional final. That gave us a glimpse of that success,” Inga Zimba, Waterville’s first singles player, said. “Our team was excited to see hoe we’d do.”
The Waterville boys tennis team reached the state championship for the first time since 1998, when the Panthers won the Class A state title.
Waterville fell in a close match to Yarmouth after defeating John Bapst, 3-2, in the Class B North regional championship match.
In Class C South, the Winthrop boys reached the Class C South finals before falling to juggernaut Waynflete, which went on to win its 13th consecutive state championship.
The 2021 season also was a season for individual achievement, with a handful of central Maine players enjoying success in the state singles tournament.
Lynch advanced to the quarterfinals of the girls tournament. Zimba reached the round of 16.
Sarah Trost of Maine Central Institute and Lindsey Bell of Gardiner each advanced to the second round.
In the boys tournament, Charlie Haberstock of Waterville and Dawson Turcotte of Skowhegan each reached the quarterfinals. Owen Evans of Waterville advanced to the second round.

Texto completo: The bill includes funding for two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, going against the president’s shipbuilding cut from earlier this year.

The House Appropriations Committee’s draft defense funding bill released Tuesday includes money for two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, reversing President Joe Biden’s cut to the defense budget earlier this year.
The Biden Administration had cut the number of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers — manufactured at Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi — requested next year from two to one. A contract between the Navy and shipyards, however, calls for two surface combat ships during the next fiscal year.
The House Appropriations Committee’s proposed bill provides $706 billion in funding, an increase of $10 billion above 2021. Of that, $24 billion is dedicated to procure eight Navy ships.
Maine’s delegation, in hearings and at BIW facilities, have spent weeks advocating to restore the ship funding. They argue cutting one ship would cripple the nation’s industrial base at Ingalls or BIW.
If Congress can’t regain the ship, one of those shipyards would be forced to lay off about 500 shipbuilders, Maine 2nd District Rep. Jared Golden said in a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee earlier this month. That potential cut to the workforce would hurt BIW especially because the company has been on a mission of bolstering its workforce over the past few years “at the request of the Navy,” Golden told The Times Record.
BIW employees about 7,300, and added almost 3,000 new employees in 2019 and 2020, with plans to hire at least 2,000 more this year.
On Tuesday, Golden, who is the vice-chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, stated: “Today’s news puts the delegation in a strong starting position to defeat this ill-advised cut proposed by the president’s administration.”
1st District Congresswoman Chellie Pingree stated that the cut “would have seriously impacted our highly-skilled shipbuilders.”
“I’m relieved the House Defense appropriations bill released today includes funding for a second DDG-51 ship, thus protecting BIW’s workforce and ensuring a competitive Navy,” Pingree stated.
Maine’s House and Senate delegation also argue that the reduction would slow the Navy’s effort to grow its fleet from 296 to 355 ships, hindering its ability to offset Pacific rival China.
With the drafted funding bill released, the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, then the full will markup for defense budget House Appropriations Committee markup the defense budget before the House votes on it. Golden warned this could happen any time between late July and early September.

Texto completo: Angry Lobster Disc Golf will open for the first time Thursday, July 1, on property that was previously used as a tree nursery.
New disc golf course highlights sport’s growing popularity
FAIRFIELD — Angry Lobster Disc Golf has transformed a tree nursery into central Maine’s latest disc golf course. Owner and manager Mark Andre is eager to get players, new and old, out there to enjoy it.
“We’re really looking forward to having our first people come through and getting feedback from them,” he said. “I’m sure there’ll be some things that we want to do to improve the course after we get feedback. But that’s really kind of what we want the course to be about — we want this to be the golfers’ course, and we’re here to maintain and improve it.”
Disc golf popularity continues to grow in the region. Quarry Road Trails in Waterville recently announced they will open a disc golf course, and Quaker Hill Disc Golf in Fairfield has been around since 2003, where they have seen steadily increased popularity over the years.
The Angry Lobster course, located at 11 Ten Lots Road in Fairfield, opens Thursday and will be open from dawn until dusk. It costs $7 per round, or $10 per day, and visitors can pay at the pro shop, or there will be an honor drop box if the shop is closed.
The course features wooded areas left over from the property’s time as a tree nursery. It will eventually have 18 holes, but two are still under construction. The course includes longer distances than other courses in the area, to help attract more advanced players, said Harley Lance Cole, Andre’s business partner, who helped design the course.
Once open, Cole will oversee the pro shop at the disc gold course.
“My main goal with the course was to try to help and elevate the game here in the state of Maine,” Cole said. “We have a lot of short courses, and I feel like it almost limits the talent that we’re able to reach for. So the main goal was to open it up and really give players a chance to reach their full potential.”
They have scorecards for both amateur and advanced players, so the course is accessible to any skill level.
There are plans to have a shop on the property as well, which will sell all the gear a disc golfer could dream of. The shop will be open in a limited capacity for now, with a few sets of discs for visitors to rent.
The original plan was for the full shop to open with the course, Andre said, but the pandemic has disrupted the supply chain for gear. Many suppliers are having difficulty providing for current clients and are not taking on new customers.
“We would love to have it up and running this year, but with the pandemic and everything, it made it very hard to get on a dealer level with some of the companies,” Cole said. “They’re having trouble even supplying their own dealers already, so they’re not accepting new ones.”
The name comes from Andre’s time as a commercial lobster fisherman in the Florida Keys. When he was fishing, Andre would use a fiberglass stick to “tickle” the lobsters out of the holes they were in. One time when he brought his partner with, she remarked that the lobsters looked angry as they were tickled out.
Later, when Andre was working on boat repairs, she said he looked like one of the “angry lobsters.” The nickname stuck, and Andre said it felt like the perfect name for the course.
The disc golf course is the latest iteration in the long history of the property. It was originally part of a land grant from the English monarchy back in the 1700s and was a working farm for more than two centuries.
“It would have been a shame to see it go under for a housing development or some other use,” Andre said. “Having a disc golf course here is a nice way to preserve the property, and the land.”
Andre brought the property in 2004, and ran a tree nursery — Thornridge Farms Nursery — growing shade, ornamental and Christmas trees.
The nursery was a joint project with his brother, Andre said. And in the last several years as his brother’s health declined, the two stopped planting new trees and began phasing out the nursery, before officially closing in 2020.
Andre himself is fairly well-known in the area, as he ran several times for the House District 110 seat in the Maine State House of Representatives, and was involved with disputes with Colby College in Waterville about student voter registration and tax rates.
The idea for a disc golf course came from employees at the nursery, Andre said, who had often mentioned that the area would make a great course. So once the nursery closed last year, he began working on the course.
“It’s probably the biggest landscape project I’ve ever done,” Andre said. “It was actually a really fun thing to do to, to go through and lay the course out, start building the stone walls, and all the tee boxes — it was just a lot of fun to put this together, and rewarding. It’s kind of like a big art project.”
And the terrain was surprisingly suitable for the course. In working on the landscaping, they only had to remove a few of the younger trees.
“It’s just a beautiful piece of property,” Cole said, “and we just want to share it with everyone.”

Texto completo: Program's classes of 2020 and 2021 faced similar challenges as they persevered through the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Sarah Colantonio credits her daughter, Adreiyanna, as the main reason she was able to walk across the stage Friday night at the Augusta Adult and Community Education program’s graduation to receive her high school diploma.
After a tough time at her original high school, Colantonio dropped out before her senior year. But over the past four years, she tested out of every exam needed to determine placement in the adult education program — except math. So she worked endlessly with teacher Tom Renckensto and finally passed.
But then the coronavirus pandemic hit and she had to move to online classes.
Inspired by her daughter’s perseverance as she “navigated a hearing world as a deaf person,” Colantonio knew she could do whatever she set her mind to, just like her daughter does everyday. She went from being someone who did not care much about school, to being at the top of her class and making the Dean’s list in her first year of college.
“I think when you have a child, the idea of being a role model changes,” Colantonio said. “My daughter is looking up to me.”
In addition to setting an example for her daughter, as a transgender woman, Colantonio wants to be a role model for the trans community. The 31-year-old has been “living authentically” for five years now.
“The transgender community is often overlooked,” she said, “and they need positive role models of people they can look up to.”
In addition to Colantonio, 16 other graduates from the Augusta Adult and Community Education program’s class of 2020 joined 28 members of the class of 2021 at a ceremony last week, celebrating their persevering through the pandemic to receive their high school equivalency diplomas.
Helen Emery, administrative assistant for the adult education program, said students in the program “kept plugging along,” and the celebration was “much needed.” The first Helen Emery Scholarship, named after her, was presented Friday to student William Osmond.
Colantonio’s favorite teacher, Renckens, presented her with the John B. Foster Scholarship.
Since finishing the program in 2020, Colantonio has enrolled at Kennebec Valley Community College to bec ome an occupational therapy assistant. She also credits that success to her 14-year-old daughter, and said she strives to use her education to help others in Maine’s deaf community.
“There is a need for deaf services in Maine,” Colantonio said. “When people think of that, usually they think of a therapist, or interpreter, or case manager, but I think OT’s are often overlooked.
“If I were to look for a signing individual who is an OT, I don’t think I would ever find that,” she added. “Using an interpreter is beneficial, but not optimal.”
While Colantonio did not have many of adult education classes online, a bulk of her KVCC courses have taken place online.
A member of the adult education program’s class of 2021, Amanda Lawson, however, has had most of hers online.
The 19-year-old enrolled in the AACE program about two years ago, when she was going into what would have been her junior year. Between home schooling and changing schools due to her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, Lawson was a couple of years behind, according to public school standards. When she was younger, she said had a hard time paying attention in public schools, so her family moved her to a special services program.
Lawson began in a traditional classroom, then the pandemic hit.
“The first year was a hard struggle. I wasn’t doing so great. But even if I wasn’t, they were working with me,” she said. “The second year, with COVID-19, was easier. We learned the stuff, did the Zoom calls. But it was a different environment (than public schools).”
One of the more-difficult aspects of remote learning was using Zoom and opening up her room to her classmates and teachers. She called her room her “safe space,” so to her it felt strange to “invite” them into it.
Lawson said she appreciated the time teachers took to ensure students were doing well and not falling behind academically, including during the ongoing pandemic.
“I never felt like I was alone,” Lawson said.
Like Colantonio, Lawson said she struggled with math, but her passion is art. Her goal is to attend the University of Maine at Farmington to pursue an art degree.
“It’s sad to graduate,” Lawson said. “It’s the most fun I’ve had in a long time.”

Texto completo: Portland's hockey team is making an affiliation announcement Wednesday, a day after news broke that the Rangers are out.
The Maine Mariners are expected to announce Wednesday that they are becoming an affiliate of the Boston Bruins.
The Press Herald confirmed the Bruins affiliation Tuesday afternoon, hours before news broke that the New York Rangers are out as the affiliate of Portland’s minor-league hockey team.
The Mariners had scheduled an affiliation announcement Wednesday morning at Cross Insurance Arena, and all signs point to the Bruins completing the trifecta of partnerships between professional sports teams in Greater Portland and their parent clubs in Boston.
The Sea Dogs are Double-A baseball partners of the Red Sox. The Red Claws recently changed their name to the Maine Celtics to better reflect their basketball relationship with the Boston Celtics.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Jacksonville Icemen announced a change in their ECHL affiliation from the Winnipeg Jets to the Rangers.
Nobody with the Mariners would publicly confirm the new partnership Tuesday. But when given the opportunity to deny that the Mariners would become a Bruins affiliate, two officials of the team declined to do so.
Since 2015, the Atlantic Gladiators have been the Bruins’ ECHL affiliate. Based in Duluth, Georgia, the Gladiators halted play in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, as did the Mariners.
The Mariners first hit the ice in Portland in 2018 as a Rangers affiliate and remained so through the 2019-20 season, which was cut short with the team on the verge of its first playoff run. Montreal also sent an occasional prospect to Portland, as did a few other NHL organizations without ECHL affiliates.
The original Maine Mariners played in the American Hockey League, one step above the ECHL, and were affiliated with the Philadelphia Flyers from 1977 to 1983, the New Jersey Devils until 1987, and (as an expansion franchise) the Boston Bruins until 1992. The franchise subsequently moved to Rhode Island to become the Providence Bruins.
By adding the Mariners as an ECHL partner, the Boston Bruins would have their top two farm clubs within an easy drive of TD Garden.
Adam Goldberg, vice president of business operations for the Mariners, would not confirm the Bruins affiliation but had this to say about Wednesday’s announcement: “I think the fan base will be excited. I think the media will be excited. It makes a lot of sense for us.”
Chris Roy, a season ticket holder from South Portland, said a Mariners-Bruins partnership makes a lot of sense from a marketing standpoint.
“I think it will help attract more fans into the arena, and at the end of the day that’s the game,” he said. “From what I know of the Bruins’ minor league affiliate at the ECHL level, I don’t see a ton of prospects, but the Mariners filled out their own roster.”
Scott Prue of North Waterboro has been a season-ticket holder since the AHL Portland Pirates skated at what was then the Cumberland County Civic Center. Although he grew up in Maine, he was never a Bruins fan. Grudgingly, he said he would change.
“I’m not going to like it, but I’ll do it,” he said.
Prue said he has been hearing talk for months about the Mariners switching affiliations to the Bruins.
“We’re going with the Bruins,” he said assuredly. “And you’ll see an increase in attendance with having the Bruins there. There’s no doubt about it.”

Texto completo: Waterville, Hall-Dale girls won state titles after the 2020 was wiped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
First came the gratitude, and it never wore off. High school tennis players who missed out on a season when the 2020 schedule was canceled in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic were eager to get back on the courts, and eager to get back to normal and vie for championships.
“Tennis is my favorite sport. Even if we didn’t have a season, I was going to get girls together just to hit it around,” said Hall-Dale No. 1 singles player Naomi Lynch.
Unlike high school sports in fall and winter in Maine, which played shorter schedules against regional competition with no statewide playoffs, spring sports was a step back to normal, with state team championships and the traditional statewide singles tournament in tennis.
“Everybody was really anxious to get back,” Hall-Dale girls tennis coach Guy Cousins said. “There was just a lot of gratitude that we had a season. Everyone was so positive. It was a season we didn’t know we’d have.”
Cousins’ Bulldogs played the regular season in masks, following social distance and disinfection protocols.
“We played with masks on almost all season. We didn’t take them off until we got to the playoffs. We were doing everything we could. We saw other teams shut down (due to Covid-19) and we weren’t.”
Lynch and Savannah Millay led an inexperienced Hall-Dale team to its first state title with a win over Orono in the state championship match.
In Class B, the Waterville girls capped an undefeated season with a win over Cape Elizabeth in the state championship.
Despite missing the 2020 season, the Purple Panthers were able to build off success enjoyed in 2019.
“In 2019, we reached the regional final. That gave us a glimpse of that success,” Inga Zimba, Waterville’s first singles player, said. “Our team was excited to see hoe we’d do.”
The Waterville boys tennis team reached the state championship for the first time since 1998, when the Panthers won the Class A state title.
Waterville fell in a close match to Yarmouth after defeating John Bapst, 3-2, in the Class B North regional championship match.
In Class C South, the Winthrop boys reached the Class C South finals before falling to juggernaut Waynflete, which went on to win its 13th consecutive state championship.
The 2021 season also was a season for individual achievement, with a handful of central Maine players enjoying success in the state singles tournament.
Lynch advanced to the quarterfinals of the girls tournament. Zimba reached the round of 16.
Sarah Trost of Maine Central Institute and Lindsey Bell of Gardiner each advanced to the second round.
In the boys tournament, Charlie Haberstock of Waterville and Dawson Turcotte of Skowhegan each reached the quarterfinals. Owen Evans of Waterville advanced to the second round.

Texto completo: The seven-day average of daily new cases stands at 25.1, compared to 192.9 a month ago.
Maine reported 32 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, as vaccinations continue to tamp down cases and the Mills administration is slated to end its state of civil emergency this week.
The seven-day average of daily new cases was 25.1, compared to 34.9 a week ago and 192.9 a month ago. During the pandemic’s peak in mid-January, Maine was often topping 600 new cases per day. There were no additional deaths Tuesday.
Because of the state’s high rate of vaccination, COVID-19 cases are under much better control, Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director, said Tuesday on Maine Public’s “Maine Calling” radio show.
“A year ago, COVID mostly controlled us. But now the tables have turned,” Shah said.
The state of emergency, in effect for 15 months, will end Wednesday. The emergency declaration gave Gov. Janet Mills’ administration sweeping powers to enact public health measures such as mandatory masking, gathering and indoor capacity limits, rules for operating schools and other restrictions.
Those restrictions have already been repealed, except for federal rules requiring masks when taking public transportation and in airports and on airplanes.
In another sign that conditions in Maine are improving, the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests has declined, from 1.18 percent two weeks ago to 0.77 percent Tuesday. A lower positivity rate means the state is finding most cases of the disease, and is able to more effectively limit its spread through measures such as quarantine and isolation for those who are unvaccinated.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 69,021 cases of COVID-19 and 858 deaths.
On the vaccination front, 775,491 people in Maine have received their final doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, representing 57.7 percent of the state’s 1.3 million population. Vaccination rates continue to vary widely among Maine counties, with 69 percent of Cumberland County’s population fully vaccinated — tops in the state — compared to 45.3 percent in Somerset County, which has Maine’s worst vaccination rate.
However, immunizations in Maine have slowed to a crawl, with 8,816 doses given in the most recent week ending Monday, compared to 19,699 the previous week. In late April, when Mainers were clamoring for shots, the state was giving about 85,000 to 90,000 doses weekly.
To try to further boost vaccination rates, Maine has launched the “Don’t Miss Your Shot: Vaccinationland Sweepstakes” — the winner will receive $1 for every person in Maine who has had at least one shot. The deadline to register is midnight Wednesday and the winner will be announced July 4.
By 8 a.m. Tuesday, 300,052 people had signed up for the sweepstakes, and the prize amount had risen to $889,014.
Meanwhile, the Maine Hospital Association wants the state to mandate that all health care workers be vaccinated against COVID-19, once federal regulators give full approval for the vaccines.
The vaccines currently in use — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — were approved in 2020 and early 2021 by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Studies show the vaccines have worked safely and effectively and they’ve been given to millions of people worldwide since December, but the full approval process takes longer.
Health care worker vaccination data published by the Maine CDC last week showed wide variations in vaccination rates among the state’s hospitals and nursing homes.
Shah said during the “Maine Calling” show that discussions with the hospital association about whether there should be a vaccine mandate for health care workers are in the very early stages.
“We are certainly thinking about it, and have had discussions about it,” Shah said. “No decisions have been made.”
Currently, there are 29 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Maine, including 19 people in intensive care.

Texto completo: Regarding the June 26 letter from a five-day visitor to Maine from Virginia, who apparently did not see enough American flags to instill confidence in Maine's patriotism and commitment to protecting our freedoms:
Perhaps he was looking in the wrong direction.
I recently witnessed the patriotism and respect paid to our veterans firsthand. My 14-year-old grandson recently invited me to join him in honoring a veteran being interred at the Southern Maine Veterans Cemetery in Springvale. The city of Sanford had invited its citizens to attend, as this veteran had apparently outlived his family and most of his friends.
When we arrived (a little early), there were a few members of local veterans groups, who helped organize the service. To our surprise, we were quickly joined by over 60 local citizens who wanted to pay their respects and gratitude for this man's service to our country. The New Hampshire chapter of the Rolling Thunder motorcycle club also arrived to honor the veteran. Each of us held an American flag (proudly) as the veteran was honored with full military and religious recognition.
I had an opportunity to ask several people why they were there. Each one said that even though they did not know the deceased, they though it only appropriate to pay their respects.
So I hope our friend from Virginia will come back to Maine. He can take a good look around and visit some of our historic sites and veterans homes. He will find that our blood is as red as his.

A different view about the dearth of U.S. flags
We thank retired Navy Cmdr.Andrew Bradick (author of a June 26 letter) for his years of service but have a different view about the lack of American flags on display in the Portland area.
After a five-day visit, he "observed a number of Black Lives Matter signs and gay pride flags" but bemoaned that "there were almost no American flags" and suggested that Mainers should be "compelled" to fly our nation's flag. First of all, Mainers love their freedom and certainly would not take kindly to being "compelled" to do almost anything that we consider to be optional.
We also suggest that after five days in Maine, he does not yet understand that most Mainers are devoted to our nation and because it is an integral part of who we are, we have no need to put that emotion on display.
We recognize, however, that we have a dreadful history of racism in America and we want to assure our neighbors that we are working toward a better U.S. and so we put the Black Lives Matter signs out to tell them that we understand. Similarly, the LGBTQ+ community has long suffered from discrimination and so we hang the Pride flag to indicate that in our community, all are welcome.
We hope that Commander Bradick will return to Maine and get to know us better.

Pine Tree Power will be in young Mainers' interests
As a young person, born and raised in Maine, I care deeply about this state and its future. Companies like Central Maine Power and Versant, Maine's major electricity providers, do not. Their decisions impact the lives of Mainers in many ways, but these decisions are motivated first by profit and are not necessarily in the best interests of Maine residents. These foreign-owned companies charge high prices for electricity and are slow to respond to power outages.
Also, despite their claims to support renewable energy, CMP and Versant have done little to suggest that they truly care about the future of the planet. Climate change is a threat to the future of my generation. One of the most important steps that Maine needs to take in response to climate change is transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy, and it is not likely that the current electricity providers will make this change in time. That is why it is so important for the Legislature, when it meets Wednesday, to pass L.D. 1708, An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a privately run, nonprofit, consumer-owned utility.
The first six communities in the United States to make the transition to 100 percent renewable energy did so through consumer-owned utilities. The Pine Tree Power Co. would help Maine make this transition as well. Because the Pine Tree Power Co. would have an elected board, it would put the interests of Mainers ahead of profit, and would give Maine residents a say over our energy future.

Collins right to oppose activist ATF nominee
Sen. Susan Collins recently announced that she will vote against the nomination of David Chipman as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, saying that she found this nomination to be "unusually divisive." I couldn't agree more.
As the executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, I work hard to preserve the rights and freedoms that we all enjoy as Americans. David Chipman, on the other hand, serves as a policy advisor for a national group that advocates for extreme gun control measures. In this role, he has been outspoken. If Mr. Chipman is confirmed to lead ATF, it will politicize a regulatory and law enforcement agency that depends on compliance to protect the public.
Mr. Chipman's nomination is no different from a Republican president putting forward the president of the National Rifle Association as a nominee. In both cases, putting forward and confirming a political activist to run a law enforcement agency will do irreparable harm to that already-controversial organization.
The Sportsman's Alliance of Maine would like to thank Sen. Collins for her thoughtful and reasonable approach to Mr. Chipman's nomination. We encourage Sen. Angus King to do the same.

Maine reported 32 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, as vaccinations continue to tamp down cases and the Mills administration is slated to end its state of civil emergency this week.

Texto completo: Police: Justin Cardelli, 41, was arrested last Wednesday after he refused to stop for a warden in Waterville and eventually fled with a female passenger into the woods off Trafton Road, before a Maine State Police canine tracked him down and bit him on the leg.
A Portland man is expected to remain behind bars until his court appearance in August after he reportedly led a game warden and Maine State Police on a chase last week through Waterville.
Justin Cardelli, 41, eventually fled into the woods, where he was tracked down by a state police dog that bit him on the leg, according to police.
Cardelli was arrested last Wednesday by Maine Game Warden Sgt. Terry Hughes and charged with eluding an officer and reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon, because he caused a vehicle crash in Waterville during the chase, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife.
Hughes was on Kennedy Memorial Drive in Waterville at about 10:30 a.m. on June 23 when he saw a blue Chevrolet pickup truck being operated somewhat erratically, according to Latti. Hughes followed the truck down Silver Street and then Elm Street, where it cut off other vehicles, according to reports.
Hughes then attempted to stop the pickup truck, which was occupied by two people, but the vehicle kept going, Latti said.
Hughes pursued the truck for more than 3 miles, according to Latti.
“(Hughes) terminated the chase due to public safety concerns,” Latti said. “He lost contact and the vehicle kept moving but Fairfield police saw it go on Interstate 95, going south.
“As it was going south, Somerset County dispatch received numerous 911 calls about that same vehicle operating dangerously. State police set up various checkpoints to stop the truck, but the vehicle pulled over on the interstate, between Webb Road and Trafton Road, and stopped.”
The man who was driving the pickup truck, later identified as Cardelli, and a woman passenger got out and flagged down a tractor-trailer, which stopped, and the pair jumped in, Latti said.
The tractor-trailer attempted to drive away, but a state trooper pulled up behind it and the man and woman jumped out of the tractor-trailer and fled into the woods, according to Latti.
As state police pursued the pair into the woods, the woman walked out on her own and onto Trafton Road, where she was taken into custody, Latti said.
A state trooper with a trained dog tracked the man into the woods, according to Latti. The dog located the suspect and bit him on the leg. State police then arrested the man.
“He was taken to MaineGeneral in Augusta,” Latti said, “where he was treated and (then) brought to the Kennebec County jail.”
When arrested, Cardelli had three warrants for his arrest that included no bail, and he was on probation, according to Latti.
Police reportedly found narcotics in the pickup truck, and there is possibility further charges will be filed, either by state police or through the Kennebec County District Attorney’s Office, according to Latti.
Cardelli, who is being held without bail, is scheduled to appear Aug. 2 at the Capital Judicial Center in Augusta.
As of Tuesday, the woman with Cardelli had not been charged, according to Latti.

Texto completo: Weather balloon carrying seven cubesats, created by teams of Maine students, reaches an altitude of 103,199 feet.
READFIELD — Students at Maranacook Community Middle School in Readfield had their shot recently at being NASA scientists.
Five students from Regional School Unit 38 collaborated with the University of Southern Maine in the college’s Cubesat Design Competition and ranked among the top-three middle schools in the state.
On Saturday, they put their cubesat — a 10-by-10-by-10-centimeter cube that poses as a satellite — to the test, as the middle schoolers sent their creation more than 100,000 feet into the air.
Marancook Community Middle School worked closely with Scott Eaton, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at the University of Southern Maine, and with USM students to design the cubesat over a couple of weeks.
The Maranacook middle schoolers chose to test Maine algae, to see if it could sustain a stable environment up in space. Roesner said the idea of the experiment is to see if the plant can reproduce as a viable food source for astronauts.
“The students chose the idea of algae,” Jean Roesner said. “Dr. Eaton helped us and said, ‘We want to design something to solve a problem, and one of the problems in long-term space missions is how to feed oneself.’ We thought working with algae might be cool.”
Ahead of Saturday, the team did not know how the algae would fair in space, so the whole experiment was authentic. It took about two hours for the water plant to reach 103,199 feet, or 19.5 miles, above the Earth’s surface.
The design competition was made possible through a grant from the Maine Space Grant Consortium, which is funded through the Space Grant from NASA. Every state across the country, along with Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., has its own network.
Along with the other schools, Maranacook was given the opportunity to “create their own mission” using a cubesat, according to Eaton.
For the project, there were two types of missions: One demonstrated technology, the other a science mission for which students measured something.
Along with the middle schools, four high schools made it to the final round of the competition, including Winslow High School, another central Maine team that decided to test a solar sail.
Eaton said the competition follows with USM’s becoming a “core expert” in this area of science, and Maine’s becoming a hub for space technology.
The three middle schools and four high schools all set their cubesats to go early Saturday at USM’s Lewison-Auburn campus. The cubesats, which were made of 3D printed materials, had a GPS inside to track where they landed. They also had radio and audio transmitters.
The cubesats went into the air like a weather balloon, using hydrogen, all the teams had their cubesat attached to the same balloon.
“Up there you can see the blackness of space, curvature of the Earth, it looks like a blue ball, it has very low pressure and low temperature,” Eaton said. “All the functionality of the satellite can be validated. There are sensors and a computer board recording the data. From that information, we can see how the algae fared. And once it comes back to Earth, we look at it under a microscope and see how it was impacted.”
The cubesat went up at a speed of 5 meters per second, Roesner said, and the University of Maine’s High Altitude Ballooning Team retrieved it once it landed.
The winners will be announced Wednesday and are being judged on build quality, completeness and the functionality of the design. The teams will also be judged on the ability to meet mission objectives.
Roesner, whose two children Emma and Myles were on the team, said the whole experience was “so cool.”
Other students on the team were Cooper Tarbuck, Natalie Stroot and Johnathin Beane. Emma Roesner and Tarbuck are rising high school freshmen, while Myles Roesner, Stroot and Beane will be seventh-graders.
The students nicknamed the cubesat their “Snot Rocket” for its green color. They are already planning a visit with Ike Levine, professor of natural and applied sciences at USM, to see how the algae fared.
“It’s been pretty neat to see,” Roesner said. “Hopefully, someday my kids will understand how cool this is.”

Texto completo: The seven-day average of daily new cases stands at 25.1, compared to 192.9 a month ago.
Maine reported 32 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, as vaccinations continue to tamp down cases and the Mills administration is slated to end its state of civil emergency this week.
The seven-day average of daily new cases was 25.1, compared to 34.9 a week ago and 192.9 a month ago. During the pandemic’s peak in mid-January, Maine was often topping 600 new cases per day. There were no additional deaths Tuesday.
Because of the state’s high rate of vaccination, COVID-19 cases are under much better control, Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director, said Tuesday on Maine Public’s “Maine Calling” radio show.
“A year ago, COVID mostly controlled us. But now the tables have turned,” Shah said.
The state of emergency, in effect for 15 months, will end Wednesday. The emergency declaration gave Gov. Janet Mills’ administration sweeping powers to enact public health measures such as mandatory masking, gathering and indoor capacity limits, rules for operating schools and other restrictions.
Those restrictions have already been repealed, except for federal rules requiring masks when taking public transportation and in airports and on airplanes.
In another sign that conditions in Maine are improving, the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests has declined, from 1.18 percent two weeks ago to 0.77 percent Tuesday. A lower positivity rate means the state is finding most cases of the disease, and is able to more effectively limit its spread through measures such as quarantine and isolation for those who are unvaccinated.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 69,021 cases of COVID-19 and 858 deaths.
On the vaccination front, 775,491 people in Maine have received their final doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, representing 57.7 percent of the state’s 1.3 million population. Vaccination rates continue to vary widely among Maine counties, with 69 percent of Cumberland County’s population fully vaccinated — tops in the state — compared to 45.3 percent in Somerset County, which has Maine’s worst vaccination rate.
However, immunizations in Maine have slowed to a crawl, with 8,816 doses given in the most recent week ending Monday, compared to 19,699 the previous week. In late April, when Mainers were clamoring for shots, the state was giving about 85,000 to 90,000 doses weekly.
To try to further boost vaccination rates, Maine has launched the “Don’t Miss Your Shot: Vaccinationland Sweepstakes” — the winner will receive $1 for every person in Maine who has had at least one shot. The deadline to register is midnight Wednesday and the winner will be announced July 4.
By 8 a.m. Tuesday, 300,052 people had signed up for the sweepstakes, and the prize amount had risen to $889,014.
Meanwhile, the Maine Hospital Association wants the state to mandate that all health care workers be vaccinated against COVID-19, once federal regulators give full approval for the vaccines.
The vaccines currently in use — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — were approved in 2020 and early 2021 by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Studies show the vaccines have worked safely and effectively and they’ve been given to millions of people worldwide since December, but the full approval process takes longer.
Health care worker vaccination data published by the Maine CDC last week showed wide variations in vaccination rates among the state’s hospitals and nursing homes.
Shah said during the “Maine Calling” show that discussions with the hospital association about whether there should be a vaccine mandate for health care workers are in the very early stages.
“We are certainly thinking about it, and have had discussions about it,” Shah said. “No decisions have been made.”
Currently, there are 29 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Maine, including 19 people in intensive care.

Texto completo: Health officials and medical providers are exploring the next steps in Maine's COVID-19 vaccination campaign as plummeting demand for shots means it could be months before the state achieves widespread inoculation - if it ever does.
Maine's vaccination rates of 57.7 percent for all residents and 65.5 percent for those old enough to get shots is among the highest in the nation alongside its New England neighbors. Yet the pace of vaccinations in Maine has slowed to the point where the total vaccine doses administered in Maine for all of last week -- roughly 8,500 -- was one-half to one-third of the number delivered on many single days in April and May.
At the current pace, it would take another four months to achieve a vaccination rate of 75 percent of the state's 1.3 million residents, according to tracking and projections by Bloomberg. Vermont, on the other hand, could hit that target in one month while Massachusetts and Connecticut could reach 75 percent within two months, according to the estimates.
Faced with softening - even cratering - demand, officials with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the state's health care networks are conducting a "deep dive" to better understand who has yet to be vaccinated, the reasons why and how best to reach them.
"My goal for the next phase of vaccination, if I had to summarize it, it is going to be typified by removing barriers: removing barriers for people who want to get vaccinated, for doctor's offices who want to order vaccine, so on and so forth," said Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah.
'a great place to offer COVID shots'
Gone are the days of mass vaccination clinics. Instead, a growing number of primary care physicians are offering vaccinations in more personal, private settings for those who have opted not to take advantage of the no-appointment, walk-in jabs available for months at retail pharmacies and hospital clinics statewide.
Summer is fair and festival season in Maine, and Mainers can expect to see vaccination stations offered at some - but not all - of the popular events that are returning this year after a 2020 without funnel cakes, pig racing and live music.
At the North Atlantic Blues Festival, which returns to the Rockland waterfront on July 10-11, free vaccines will be available from 6:30-10 p.m. during Saturday evening's "Club Crawl" near the park on Main Street. Rockland's main drag is closed to traffic and the public is allowed to stroll the music-filled street for free during the crawl.
Festival organizer Paul Benjamin said he worked with city and county leaders to set up the vaccination station, which will offer both the "one and done" shot produced by Johnson & Johnson as well as the first shot of Pfizer for anyone 12 or over. Those who do will receive a free book and DVD about the blues festival.
"There are probably 4,000 to 5,000 people down there," Benjamin said of the free Saturday night portion of the festival. "There are a lot of families so we decided it would be a great place to offer COVID shots."
Officials with the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry also plan to talk about the issue with representatives of Maine's more than 20 agricultural fairs. Those fairs, which kicked off this month in Monmouth, draw hundreds of thousands of visitors, many from rural areas where vaccination rates are considerably lower than in southern and coastal Maine.
Leon Brillant, president of the Topsham Fair, said organizers met recently with representatives of Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick. Although details have yet to be ironed out for the fair, which takes place August 10-15, Brillant said he was "pretty sure we will do something" for the event, which typically pulls in 28,000 to 30,000 spectators.
"We want to do it," Brillant said. "It's a good thing."
about to be 'trying everything'
For health care providers, this next phase of the vaccination campaign will be about "trying everything - like throwing spaghetti against the wall," said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth. While that spaghetti won't always stick, Mills said, even the less-fruitful ventures can be educational.
For instance, MaineHealth vaccinated a total of 20 people during two recent Summer Sunsets Live music events that drew about 1,000 people each night to Thompson's Point in Portland. MaineHealth's trailer was located in a high-traffic area and well promoted throughout an event that catered to a younger crowd that likely included include a fair number of unvaccinated people, based on Maine CDC data.
"We were the only place without a line," Mills said with a laugh.
Mills, who is a former Maine CDC director and the sister of Gov. Janet Mills, said as she watched the crowd of mostly young people she realized not many would be interested in peeling off from their group to sit for a shot, plus the 15-minute post-jab monitoring period. And she couldn't blame them, given the social aspect of the evening.
"It wasn't a mistake and I'm glad we did it," Mills said. "We did learn some good lessons - like maybe a concert is not the best venue."
Instead, MaineHealth has found more success staging pop-up clinics at breweries and other businesses in both the Portland area as well as parts of the state with lower vaccination rates. Mills said in these smaller venues, people may be more likely to at least stop by the table to ask questions about the vaccines even if they don't necessarily get the shot that day.
Likewise, Northern Light Homecare and Hospice is working with businesses and event organizers to stage pop-up clinics around the state. Recent events have been held at speedways, an ice cream shop, a seafood shack, the Bangor Pride observances, a recovery center and a YMCA.
Northern Light spokeswoman Karen Cashman said the network is also working with EMS agencies and other partners to vaccinate homebound individuals around the state as well as to hold clinics for homeless individuals through a program organized by the South Portland Fire Department.
"We look forward to continuing to serve our community by making vaccines available to all who want to be vaccinated," Cashman said. "Moving forward, Northern Light Health's focus is offering COVID-19 vaccinations in more personalized, localized, and easily accessible settings such as primary care offices, walk-in care, women's health, pediatrics, as well as smaller clinic settings to help underserved communities."
'every little bit helps'
While the numbers are small compared to the large-scale clinics during the spring, event organizers say it is progress nonetheless. About 20 people took advantage of a vaccination event at the June 10 Portland Sea Dogs game, for instance, and received free food as well as a free ticket to a future game.
Geoff Iacuessa, president and general manager of the Sea Dogs, said the staff from Northern Light's Mercy Hospital told him that "20 is better than zero and every little bit helps."
"We are hoping to do at least one more prior to the end of the season but really we are open to doing as many as they want to do," Iacuessa said. "They did all of the heavy lifting. We just provided the room to them."
Shah, the Maine CDC director, said his agency is working closely with doctor's offices to help them get vaccine doses. Whereas in the past groups of primary care offices had to commit to doing 1,000 doses a week because of scant supplies of vaccine, now the Maine CDC is able to ship as few as 20 doses a week to offices that request them.
Shah said the Maine CDC also will be analyzing data, conducting surveys and potentially holding focus groups to get a better sense of who in Maine is still unvaccinated and why. Speaking during last week's briefing, Shah said there are still barriers that have discouraged or prevented some Mainers from getting a shot and he is committed to helping remove those obstacles.
"In rural counties it may be ideological," Shah said. "In other places, it may be social determinants: getting time off of work, having transportation, making hours for vaccination sites work for them. Time will tell. It will be an empirical question as much as anything else."

Texto completo: The House Appropriations Committee's draft defense funding bill released Tuesday includes money for two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, reversing President Biden's cut to the defense budget earlier this year.
The Biden administration had cut the number of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers - manufactured at Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi - requested next year from two to one. A contract between the Navy and shipyards, however, calls for two surface combat ships during the next fiscal year.
The House Appropriations Committee's proposed bill provides $706 billion in funding, an increase of $10 billion above 2021. Of that, $24 billion is dedicated to procure eight Navy ships.
Maine's delegation, in hearings and at BIW facilities, have spent weeks advocating to restore the ship funding. They argue cutting one ship would cripple the nation's industrial base at Ingalls or BIW.
If Congress can't regain the ship, one of those shipyards would be forced to lay off about 500 shipbuilders, Maine 2nd District Rep. Jared Golden said in a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee earlier this month. That potential cut to the workforce would especially hurt BIW because the company has been bolstering its workforce over the past few years "at the request of the Navy," Golden told The Times Record.
On Tuesday, Golden, vice-chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, stated: "Today's news puts the delegation in a strong starting position to defeat this ill-advised cut proposed by the president's administration."
Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, stated that the cut "would have seriously impacted our highly skilled shipbuilders."
"I'm relieved the House Defense appropriations bill released today includes funding for a second DDG-51 ship, thus protecting BIW's workforce and ensuring a competitive Navy," Pingree stated.
Maine's House and Senate delegation also argue that the reduction would slow the Navy's effort to grow its fleet from 296 to 355 ships, hindering its ability to counter China's naval expansion in the Pacific.
With the draft bill released, the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, then the full House Appropriations Committee, will mark up the defense budget before the House votes on it. Golden warned this could happen any time between late July and early September.

Texto completo: SOUTH PORTLAND -- The first citywide property revaluation in 15 years has pushed up residential property assessments an average of 45 percent, with homes in popular waterfront neighborhoods increasing as much as 70 percent amid a pandemic-fueled real estate boom.
The residential tax rate has yet to be set, but tax bills to be mailed in the coming weeks are expected to increase an average of 18 to 20 percent, City Assessor Jim Thomas said.
Commercial property assessments, meanwhile, increased an average of 25 to 28 percent, although new values in that sector have yet to be finalized and fully analyzed, Thomas said.
"In 15 years, pretty much everything has gone up in value," Thomas said Tuesday. "We didn't count on the craziness of the last three years and the COVID-19 pandemic. We delayed the revaluation because we thought real estate prices would tumble. But that didn't happen."
Instead of tanking, housing prices soared across Maine, where single-family home sales increased more than 9 percent in 2020, and the median home price increased nearly 14 percent, to $256,000, according to the Maine Association of Realtors.
With such a hot market, even cities and towns that had recently updated assessed values were suddenly outdated, and pressure increased in South Portland and neighboring Portland, where revaluations had been put off for more than a decade. Portland residents, who have been bracing for similar increases, began receiving their new assessed property values this week.
In South Portland, even in less tony areas, 55 percent of homes sold for more than the listing price in 2020, according to Redfin.com. A home in the Willard Beach area that sold for $400,000 in 2018 went for $585,000 two years later - a 46 percent increase, Thomas said. A home in the Cash Corner neighborhood, where Broadway crosses Route 1, sold for $275,000 in 2019 and again in 2020 for $407,100 - a 48 percent increase. Neither house had been significantly improved, Thomas said.
living 'close to the bone'
Based on new home values posted in South Portland last week, residential tax bills are expected to increase an average of 18 to 20 percent, Thomas said. The residential portion of the taxpayer pie - currently 54 percent - is expected to increase about the same amount, fulfilling concerns about a shift in tax responsibility from commercial to residential property owners.
With the revaluation, the median assessed value of single-family homes in South Portland increased 41 percent, from $204,000 to $287,000, Thomas said. The tax impact of that increase will be mitigated somewhat because the tax rate is expected to drop, from $19.75 to $16 or less per $1,000 of assessed property value.
Thomas expects to set the new tax rate late next week. Tax bills would be mailed a couple weeks later.
In the meantime, many homeowners are checking their new assessments and trying to figure out what their tax bills will be, including Diane and Dan Romano, who raised their concerns with city officials last spring.
The assessed value of their Simonton Street bungalow, a few blocks from Willard Beach, has increased 53 percent, from $283,000 to $433,100. Their annual property tax bill is set to increase about $1,400, or 27 percent, from $5,100 to more than $6,500, based on the estimated $16 tax rate and after the $25,000 homestead exemption. That's a big jump from the usual $100 annual increase.
"That's close to $120 a month," said Diane Romano, an accounting clerk. "I feel a sense of relief that it's not worse. I was thinking it might be a $2,500 increase."
Some of Romano's neighbors have seen their assessed values increase 60 to 65 percent, she said. Last spring, Romano told city councilors that she was prepared to sell her plasma to cover the tax increase. Now, she plans to ask her boss for a small raise. Her husband is self-employed.
"We live pretty close to the bone as it is. We don't even have cable television," Romano said Tuesday. "But I feel for people living on fixed incomes. Fortunately, we're only 57. If we were retired, that $1,500 might as well be $15,000."
A revaluation is a community-wide update of assessed property values that are tied to market values and are the basis for annual tax bills. In general, property owners whose new assessed values have increased more than the average will see their tax bills go up, while property owners whose values have increased less than the average will see their tax bills drop.
fears about tax base
Both South Portland and Portland put long-delayed revaluations on hold last year because of the pandemic. Neither had updated property values citywide for 15 years and their overall property assessments had fallen below 70 percent of market value, a major legal trigger for revaluations.
The state Constitution also says revaluations must be done at least once every 10 years - a law that isn't generally enforced - and it requires property taxes to be apportioned and assessed equally according to just value, which the courts have determined is market value.
In South Portland, the old precept about revaluations is expected to hold true: About one-third of tax bills will go up, one-third will go down and one-third will stay the same. However, the first category likely will be mostly homeowners given the recent spike in residential market values.
In communities where commercial properties have gained value but haven't kept up with residential values, revaluations are shifting some of the tax responsibility onto homeowners.
Thomas is concerned that South Portland's revaluation may further erode a commercial tax base that was under significant strain before the pandemic, including the retail area around the Maine Mall.
"Right now my real worries are restaurants and retail strips," he said.
Marty Riehle shares Thomas' concern for preserving the commercial tax base. Riehle and Janice Childs bought their single-family home on Simonton Street in 2009. They paid $450,000 for their cape, which was assessed at $351,800 before the revaluation.
Now, it's assessed at $541,700 - a 54 percent increase - with a taxable value of $516,700 after the $25,000 homestead exemption. Their annual tax bill is set to increase about $1,817, or 28 percent, from $6,455 to $8,272. Riehle said they can afford the increase but worries about others who are on fixed incomes.
"It's why people in South Portland should be concerned about businesses," said Riehle, a retired hospital administrator who sits on the city's Economic Development Committee.
Riehle said South Portland has developed a reputation for being anti-business in recent years, and while the city should be selective in the types of businesses it promotes, it must recognize that a thriving business community helps shoulder the tax burden.
"People have got to support our businesses," Riehle said.

Texto completo: The Legislature's Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee on Sunday reached an agreement on a $8.5 billion two-year budget proposal that invests in the well-being of Maine people and, by extension, the state's future.
The full Legislature will take up the proposal as it returns to the State House on Wednesday. Lawmakers should pass the budget so that it can immediately begin its work.
The proposal would supersede the budget passed, with Democratic votes only, in March. Since then, Maine's revenue picture has only gotten better, allowing the state to take care of a number of its outstanding needs while still contributing to the rainy day fund.
The proposal represents a compromise between Democrats, who have a majority in the Legislature - though not the two-thirds required to pass emergency legislation - and the minority Republicans. There appears to be little hangover from March's contentious party-line budget vote.
Included in the budget plan are a number of issues our Editorial Board has long considered priorities.
If the budget is approved, the state will for the first time fund 55 percent of K-12 education costs, a goal since 2004. That means tens of millions of dollars more for Maine schools - and for reducing the property tax burden in our communities.
Also reducing that burden in the budget are the restoration of municipal revenue sharing to its statutory level of 5 percent in the second year; an expansion of the property tax fairness credit, and an increased reimbursement to cities and towns from the Homestead Exemption Program.
The budget also provides breakfast and lunch for all students, with no strings attached. Students who now struggle to get enough food will know they'll have at least two healthy meals a day, and that hunger won't keep them from achieving at school.
The budget also addresses the lack of support for direct care workers by increasing wages paid through MaineCare to 125 percent of the minimum wage. If nothing else, the pandemic showed how essential these workers are. Maine families desperately need people to fill these jobs, and those workers should be valued. Raising their wages does both.
It also would extend, through MaineCare, preventative dental care to an estimated 217,000 Mainers who now have to wait for an emergency to get help. It includes $40 million for the Land for Maine's Future conservation program, as well as funding for the discovery and mitigation land contaminated with "forever chemicals."
The large-scale investments in the budget will make an enormous difference in people's lives.
What's more, a minimum of $60 million to the rainy day fund, which would then be at a record high of $328 million. Additionally, Republicans sought and achieved a "hazard payment" of around $300 for workers who meet income guidelines - further tax relief, essentially. That extra cash will certainly be welcomed by the many Mainers who have struggled in the last year.
There's a lot to like in the budget proposal - there's a reason it gained unanimous support in the Appropriations committee.
Now, it will need a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate to pass into law immediately upon the governor's signature. Legislators should give it those votes.

Texto completo: A third straight day of oppressive heat and humidity is on tap for Maine on Wednesday, but relief from the scorching temperatures should arrive overnight, the National Weather Service said.
Portland on Tuesday tied its record high of 96 degrees, a mark set in 1944, at the Portland Jetport at 2:55 p.m., according to weather service meteorologist Chris Kimble.
With just one day left to sweat through, this is shaping up to be Maine's hottest June on record, Kimble said. The June record was set in 2001 with an average temperature of 67.1. But this year, the average temperature stands at 67.8 and that is not likely to change by the end of the day Wednesday.
Kimble said the National Weather Service is forecasting a high of 94 Wednesday in Portland. If that happens, Portland and most of Maine will have experienced an official heat wave - defined as three consecutive days of highs of 90 or higher. Sunday's high was 87, but highs of 97 and 96 were recorded Monday and Tuesday in Portland.
Things should start to cool down late Wednesday, accompanied by scattered, severe thunderstorms packing heavy rain and damaging winds starting in the afternoon. Forecasts call for a high of about 81 forecast for Thursday and 68 for Friday, Kimble said. In the meantime, the weather service is urging people to stay hydrated and seek shade or air conditioning whenever possible. A heat advisory will be in effect from 11 a.m. through 8 p.m. Wednesday.
Wednesday's heat index will be dangerously high, the combination of heat and humidity making it feel like 100 degrees, Kimble said. That happened Tuesday around 4 p.m. in Portland with the temperature reaching 96 and the heat index making it feel like 101 degrees.
More records could be tied or broken Wednesday. Portland's high of 96 degrees for June 30 was recorded in 1971.
"It's not out of the question, we could tie or set a new record on Wednesday," Kimble said, adding that it has not been this hot in Maine since 2016, when a high of 99 was recorded in Portland on Aug. 12.
The combination of extreme heat and lack of precipitation prompted the South Berwick Water District to issue a mandatory water conservation notice Tuesday. The outdoor water conservation measures will remain in place until further notice.
Water customers asked to refrain from all outdoor uses of water including the use of sprinklers and irrigation systems, washing vehicles and filling swimming pools.
Cities and towns across Maine opened cooling centers Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the Maine Emergency Management Center.
Among the cooling centers open Wednesday are the Augusta Civic Center 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Falmouth Ice Center on Hat Trick Drive from 4 a.m. to midnight; the South Portland Community Center from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.; and the Troubh Ice Arena, 225 Park Ave. in Portland, from 9 a.m. through 4 p.m.
Beaches were a popular destination Wednesday. Popham Beach State in Phippsburg reached capacity at 11 a.m. and was forced to turn away visitors.
Power outages plagued some communities Tuesday, but Central Maine Power Company said it has been closely monitoring the power distribution system.
"Persistently hot days create a huge demand for energy," CMP tweeted Tuesday night. "CMP is closely monitoring the system through the heat and proactively managing the demand to provide reliable power."
Nearly 1,500 CMP customers in nine counties were without power as of 8 p.m. Tuesday. The number of outages dropped to 854 at 9 p.m. Only 329 Versant Power customers were without power Tuesday evening. Versant serves customers in northern and Down East Maine.
Maine is not alone in its suffering. A record breaking heat wave has been scorching the Pacific Northwest with temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees. Portland, Oregon, hit 108 Saturday, 112 Sunday and 116 on Monday.

Texto completo: After spending more than a year dealing with COVID-19, our country is finally starting to open back up. But our return to normal has been marred by senseless acts of violence around the country. These tragedies serve as stark reminders that it's long past time to confront our nation's other epidemic: gun violence.
Gun violence threatens Americans in every facet of our daily lives. Whether we are sending our kids to school, picking up groceries from the store or praying in our houses of worship, the threat of gun violence is nearly omnipresent in many parts of our country.
There have already been over 300 mass shootings in 2021 alone (according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four people are shot or killed, not including the shooter). Our hearts broke when eight people, six of whom were Asian American women, were killed in spas across Atlanta in March - and then again not even a week later, when 10 more were killed at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, including a brave law enforcement officer who tried to stop the perpetrator. Here in Maine, an average of three people die from gun violence - from suicide or homicide - every week.
I fully support the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners. But I also know that unregulated guns can make a community less safe. In Maine, the presence of firearms exacerbates the risk of death by domestic violence and suicide, and causes heartache for families when children access unsecured firearms, such as what occurred in West Bath in May when a 2-year-old discharged an unsecured, loaded firearm, shooting and injuring his mother and father while an infant sibling lay nearby.
The normal we return to as the pandemic ends contains even more firearms, given that gun sales spiked sharply during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic and have continued to increase in the United States. Nevertheless, our new normal should not be one of fear. That's why we need the U.S. Senate to act on gun violence, and Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins to support the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.
This bill, which has already been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, is simple, yet incredibly important. It would ensure that background checks are part of every gun sale. Right now, millions of firearm sales happen without background checks every year, online, person to person and at gun shows. This bill would close that dangerous loophole.
And that's it. That's all it does. It's not an attack on guns, or on law-abiding people displaying good judgment every day. This is a common-sense approach to make sure that those who are legally prohibited from owning a gun because of things like felony convictions and commitments to psychiatric institutions can't get their hands on a gun. We conduct extensive background checks on the people we hire, the equipment we utilize and the policies we deploy. Why shouldn't we apply these same methods to something as critical as the sale of firearms?
According to new polling, a stunning 70 percent of Mainers support the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. Not only does this include both Democrats and Republicans, but it also includes gun owners: Sixty-three percent of them support the bill.
I ran for office because I want families in my community to live their lives to the fullest extent possible. I want my constituents to be able to live, work and raise a family safely, without the fear of gun violence. Enacting state laws that mandate safe storage of loaded firearms around children, and working nationally to close the loopholes in our background checks system, will bring us closer to this safer future. I ask our U.S. senators to find the courage to act and vote for universal background checks.

Texto completo: Six new solar projects and one existing wind farm were selected Tuesday by the Maine Public Utilities Commission as the best clean-energy choices to supply power for Central Maine Power and Versant Power customers.
Among solar developers, Glenvale LLC and Walden Renewables were awarded two projects each, and Swift Current and C2 Energy Capital LLC were awarded one project each. These new solar projects will sign contracts for 100 percent of their energy output.
The one existing project winner, for 50 percent of its 132-megawatt output, was Helix Maine Wind Development LLC. The wind farm is in the Boundary Mountains of Franklin County.
"Today's announcement by the PUC is further evidence of extraordinary momentum in Maine's clean energy sector, which is creating good-paying jobs across our state, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, and continuing our fight against climate change," said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor's Energy Office. "The projects selected by the PUC will provide renewable energy at competitive prices, which will benefit Maine ratepayers and move Maine toward its nation-leading climate and energy goals."
More details about the projects will be available when the PUC releases its formal order.
In total, the projects have a generation capacity of 289 megawatts. They will provide power for first-year contract prices that are very competitive in New England's wholesale power market.
"I am again pleased with the results of this procurement, as participation was robust and the bids were very competitive," PUC Commission Chairman Philip Bartlett said. "Initial prices range from 2.8 cents to 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. These prices, combined with the economic and environmental benefits that the projects will provide, are a positive outcome for Maine."
Based on estimates provided by the bidders to the PUC, the projects also will:
n
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 260,000 tons per year.
n
Create roughly 175 full-time-equivalent jobs during construction and 14 full-time-equivalent jobs in each year of operations.
n
Lead to initial capital spending with Maine-based entities of more than $86 million, and purchases of goods and services averaging more than $2.6 million annually during the 20-year contract term.
n
Pay taxes to Maine entities and host communities averaging $4.1 million annually during the 20-year contract term.
highly competitive bidding
Tuesday's selection was the second part of a bidding process set up to satisfy a 2019 law to expand the amount of clean energy that Maine utilities must have in their supply mix.
Known as a renewable portfolio standard, the law upped the target level of green power to 80 percent of electricity sales by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050. These levels are considered an essential element of Maine's strategy to combat climate change and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
Interest groups that support clean energy reacted favorably following the decision.
A spokesman for the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a trade group representing clean energy generators in the state, said the outcome will be a good deal for electric customers.
"Today's unanimous approval by the Maine PUC demonstrates (that) a highly competitive bidding process will help to bring low-cost, high-value Maine-made solar and wind for the benefit of all Maine ratepayers," said Jeremy Payne, the association's executive director. "As expected, the solicitation attracted a high number of bids. The approved contract pricing was between 2.85 and 3.95 cents/kwh, which offers tremendous short, medium and long-term value to homeowners and businesses alike."
clean energy future
The Natural Resources Council of Maine said the project awards create a future in which Maine residents and businesses are powered by clean energy from local resources.
"The PUC's approval of seven very competitive solar and wind energy projects is further proof that Maine's vital transition to 100 percent clean energy is accelerating and beginning to deliver vast economic, environmental and public health benefits," said David Costello, the group's climate and clean-energy director.
Last September, the PUC approved contracts for 17 renewable power projects - largely solar, but also wind, biomass and hydroelectric. Taken together, those projects will have a generating capacity of 492 megawatts. They represent the largest procurement of clean-energy initiated by the state since at least the 1980s and 1990s, when laws designed to reduce dependence on imported oil spawned a fleet of wood-fired, hydroelectric and waste-to-energy projects.
cost competitve alternatives
More than 70 renewable energy developers presented proposals to the PUC, which analyzed them and drew up a short list.
Those first-pick projects were expected to create 450 jobs during construction and 30 jobs during each year of operation. They also were projected to spur an estimated $145 million in spending, including roughly $11 million in wood harvesting payments.
In both cases, the PUC scored each bidder through an evaluation process that put the greatest weight on customer benefits, notably competitive rates. They will be achieved mostly through 20-year contracts with CMP and Versant. Advantages for the state's economy, such as job creation, capital investment and benefits to host communities, also were part of the scoring.
Both rounds of contracts also highlighted how large-scale solar power has emerged as a cost-competitive alternative to natural gas, the dominant form of power generation in New England.
The number of homes powered by a megawatt of solar power can vary significantly from state to state, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. In Maine, roughly 130 homes would be powered by 1 megawatt, the trade group estimates.
Based on legislation, when all the projects are online, they will generate energy equal to 14 percent of Maine's retail electricity sales during 2018, or a total of 1.7 million megawatt-hours.

Texto completo: The bill includes funding for two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, going against the president’s shipbuilding cut from earlier this year.

The House Appropriations Committee’s draft defense funding bill released Tuesday includes money for two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, reversing President Joe Biden’s cut to the defense budget earlier this year.
The Biden Administration had cut the number of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers — manufactured at Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi — requested next year from two to one. A contract between the Navy and shipyards, however, calls for two surface combat ships during the next fiscal year.
The House Appropriations Committee’s proposed bill provides $706 billion in funding, an increase of $10 billion above 2021. Of that, $24 billion is dedicated to procure eight Navy ships.
Maine’s delegation, in hearings and at BIW facilities, have spent weeks advocating to restore the ship funding. They argue cutting one ship would cripple the nation’s industrial base at Ingalls or BIW.
If Congress can’t regain the ship, one of those shipyards would be forced to lay off about 500 shipbuilders, Maine 2nd District Rep. Jared Golden said in a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee earlier this month. That potential cut to the workforce would hurt BIW especially because the company has been on a mission of bolstering its workforce over the past few years “at the request of the Navy,” Golden told The Times Record.
BIW employees about 7,300, and added almost 3,000 new employees in 2019 and 2020, with plans to hire at least 2,000 more this year.
On Tuesday, Golden, who is the vice-chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, stated: “Today’s news puts the delegation in a strong starting position to defeat this ill-advised cut proposed by the president’s administration.”
1st District Congresswoman Chellie Pingree stated that the cut “would have seriously impacted our highly-skilled shipbuilders.”
“I’m relieved the House Defense appropriations bill released today includes funding for a second DDG-51 ship, thus protecting BIW’s workforce and ensuring a competitive Navy,” Pingree stated.
Maine’s House and Senate delegation also argue that the reduction would slow the Navy’s effort to grow its fleet from 296 to 355 ships, hindering its ability to offset Pacific rival China.
With the drafted funding bill released, the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, then the full will markup for defense budget House Appropriations Committee markup the defense budget before the House votes on it. Golden warned this could happen any time between late July and early September.

MS/KJ: Bill banning flavored tobacco loses funding in state budget compromise

Texto completo: Law that would ban sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, could be in jeopardy as bipartisan budget deal fails to backfill tax revenue loss.
A bill that would ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, could be on its way to defeat in the Legislature as a bipartisan budget compromised brokered over the weekend excluded funding for the measure.
The tobacco legislation, which would cost the state about $32 million in lost sales tax revenue if approved, is among about 45 bills lawmakers will take up when they return to session Wednesday morning.
The Legislature will also take votes on 11 vetoes issued by Gov. Janet Mills in recent days, including one on a bill that would force the closure of the Long Creek Youth Development Center, the state’s only juvenile prison.
Also on deck is a bill that would move Maine toward a statewide vote on whether a new consumer-owned electric utility should be created to takeover Central Maine Power and Versant Power companies.
Mills, a Democrat, had signaled her support for the tobacco bill last month in a budget proposal that set aside $32 million in surplus revenue to cover the cost of the measure. But the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee cast a unanimous vote Sunday on a budget change package that excludes funding for the bill.
Supporters of the measure, including health advocates who work to keep kids from smoking and vaping, expressed their disappointment Tuesday.
“Tobacco has taken over our schools and our children’s lives,” Dr. Deborah Hagler, a Brunswick pediatrician and President of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a prepared statement issued by Flavors Hook Kids, a coalition supporting the bill. “Menthol, candy, and dessert flavors lure them, then nicotine gets them hooked.”
As both a doctor and a parent, Hagler said she was “astonished” by the committee vote. “Our kids are being relentlessly targeted by the tobacco industry, and lawmakers are doing nothing to protect them,” she said.
The American Lung Association also criticized the Legislature’s decision. The organization noted that the state has also reduced funding for tobacco prevention programs in the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention by $5 million.
“In the midst of a respiratory pandemic, worsened by tobacco use, this is a double blow to the long-term health of Mainers,” the association’s senior advocacy director, Lance Boucher, said in a written statement. “Today, Maine is failing to protect our children, including the one in three Maine high school students who currently use some form of tobacco.”
The bill, L.D. 1550, enjoyed bipartisan support at a hearing in May but has since faced opposition from organizations supportive of small businesses, especially convenience store owners, who derive some of their income from the sale of tobacco products.
Mills’ press secretary, Lindsay Crete, said Mills supports the budget deal reached by lawmakers and was unlikely to try to make line-by-line changes to it.
“The Governor is interested in garnering broad, bipartisan support for the budget, not in line iteming portions of it,” Crete wrote in an email. “She applauds the Appropriations Committee’s unanimous, bipartisan agreement, which she believes will make important, meaningful and historic progress for Maine people, including finally meeting the state’s obligation to fully fund education, increasing revenue sharing and property tax relief, and making health care, like dental care, more accessible.”
Crete also confirmed Mills fully supports a provision in the budget deal brokered by minority Republicans that will send a $300 payment to those who worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Maine.
“Many Maine people worked hard throughout the pandemic to keep our economy going, despite the risk to themselves and their families, and she believes they deserve recognition for their efforts,” Crete wrote. “She applauds Republicans and Democrats for coming together to create this provision.”
Crete also reiterated Mills’ concerns around the power company takeover bill. That measure failed enactment in the Senate by one vote earlier this month but could face additional votes, including on a recent amendment aimed at addressing concerns over lost property tax revenue. Crete said the last-minute move to amend the bill was more evidence the legislation needed more work.
“The unveiling of this amendment — one day prior to a vote on it, which also will be the same day the Legislature is scheduled to consider a host of serious matters, including the budget — leaves little time for serious public consideration and feedback and simply underscores one of the Governor’s primary concerns: that proponents of the legislation are attempting to too quickly advance a bill that would have massive implications for the state without having addressed its serious questions in a robust way,” Crete wrote.
“(Gov. Mills) is sympathetic to the concerns about Maine’s utilities, but she continues to believe that this bill presents a rosy solution to a complicated problem and, if advanced, would create more problems than it actually solves.”
Also on Mills’ desk is a bill that would allow the four Native American tribes in Maine to open casinos on tribal lands. For decades the tribes have worked to regain gambling rights allowed to them under federal law but denied to them under a law that settled a land dispute between the tribes and the state in 1980.
Crete said Mills’ office would likely be announcing additional bills she had signed into law or vetoed over the next 48 hours, but she did not offer any specifics.
Both the state House and Senate are expected to convene at 10 a.m. Wednesday.

Texto completo: The state and health care providers will try new approaches and settings for inoculating people.

Health officials and medical providers are exploring next steps in Maine’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign as plummeting demand for shots means it could be months before the state achieves widespread inoculation — if it ever does.
Maine continues to have among the highest vaccination rates in the nation alongside its New England neighbors. Yet the pace of vaccinations in Maine has slowed to the point where the total vaccine doses administered in Maine for all of last week — roughly 8,500 — was one half to one-third of the number delivered on many single days in April and May.
At the current pace, it would take another four months to achieve a vaccination rate of 75 percent of the state’s 1.3 million residents, according to tracking and projections by Bloomberg. Vermont, on the other hand, could hit that target in one month while Massachusetts and Connecticut could reach 75 percent within two months, according to the estimates.
Faced with softening — even cratering — demand, officials with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the state’s health care networks are conducting a “deep dive” to better understand who has yet to be vaccinated, the reasons why and how best to reach them.
“My goal for the next phase of vaccination, if I had to summarize it, it is going to be typified by removing barriers: removing barriers for people who want to get vaccinated, for doctor’s offices who want to order vaccine, so on and so forth,” said Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah.
Gone are the days of mass vaccination clinics. Instead, a growing number of primary care physicians are offering vaccinations in more personal, private settings for those who have opted not to take advantage of the no-appointment, walk-in jabs available for months at retail pharmacies and hospital clinics statewide.
Summer is fair and festival season in Maine, and Mainers can expect to see vaccination stations offered at some — but not all — of the popular events that are returning this year after a 2020 without funnel cakes, pig racing and live music.
At the North Atlantic Blues Festival, which returns to the Rockland waterfront on July 10-11, free vaccines will be available from 6:30-10 p.m. during Saturday evening’s “Club Crawl” near the park on Main Street. Rockland’s main drag is closed to traffic and the public is allowed to stroll the music-filled street for free during the crawl.
Festival organizer Paul Benjamin said he worked with city and county leaders to set up the vaccination station, which will offer both the “one and done” shot produced by Johnson & Johnson as well as the first shot of Pfizer for anyone 12 or over. Those who do will also receive a free book and DVD about the blues festival.
“There are probably 4,000 to 5,000 people down there,” Benjamin said of the free Saturday night portion of the festival. “There are a lot of families so we decided it would be a great place to offer COVID shots.”
Officials with the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry also plan to talk about the issue with representatives of Maine’s more than 20 agricultural fairs. Those fairs, which kicked off this month in Monmouth, draw hundreds of thousands of visitors, many from rural areas where vaccination rates are considerable lower than in southern and coastal Maine.
Leon Brillant, president of the Topsham Fair, said organizers met recently with representatives of Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick. Although details have yet to be ironed out for the fair, which takes place August 10-15, Brillant said he was “pretty sure we will do something” for the event, which typically pulls in 28,000 to 30,000 spectators.
“We want to do it,” Brillant said. “It’s a good thing.”
For health care providers, this next phase of the vaccination campaign will be about “trying everything — like throwing spaghetti against the wall,” said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth. While that spaghetti won’t always stick, Mills said, even the less-fruitful ventures can be educational.
For instance, MaineHealth vaccinated a total of 20 people during two recent Summer Sunsets Live music events that drew about 1,000 people each night to Thompson’s Point in Portland. MaineHealth’s trailer was located in a high-traffic area and well promoted throughout an event that catered to a younger crowd that likely included include a fair number of unvaccinated people, based on Maine CDC age data.
“We were the only place without a line,” Mills said with a laugh.
Mills, who is a former Maine CDC director and the sister of Gov. Janet Mills, said as she watched the crowd of mostly young people she realized not many would be interested in peeling off from their group to sit for a shot, plus the 15-minute post-jab monitoring period. And she couldn’t blame them, given the social aspect of the evening.
“It wasn’t a mistake and I’m glad we did it,” Mills said. “We did learn some good lessons — like maybe a concert is not the best venue.”
Instead, MaineHealth has found more success staging pop-up clinics at breweries and other businesses in both the Portland area as well as parts of the state with lower vaccination rates. Mills said in these smaller venues, people may be more likely to at least stop by the table to ask questions about the vaccines even if they don’t necessarily get the shot that day.
Likewise, Northern Light Homecare and Hospice is working with businesses and event organizers to stage pop-up clinics around the state. Recent events have been held at speedways, an ice cream shop, a seafood shack, the Bangor Pride observances, a recovery center and a YMCA.
Northern Light spokeswoman Karen Cashman said the network is also working with EMS agencies and other partners to vaccinate homebound individuals around the state as well as to hold clinics for homeless individuals through a program organized by the South Portland Fire Department.
“We look forward to continuing to serve our community by making vaccines available to all who want to be vaccinated,” Cashman said. “Moving forward, Northern Light Health’s focus is offering COVID-19 vaccinations in more personalized, localized, and easily accessible settings such as primary care offices, walk-in care, women’s health, pediatrics, as well as smaller clinic settings to help underserved communities.”
While the numbers are small compared to the large-scale clinics during the spring, event organizers say it is progress nonetheless. About 20 people took advantage of a vaccination event at the June 10 Portland Sea Dogs game, for instance, and received free food as well as a free ticket to a future game.
Geoff Iacuessa, president and general manager of the Sea Dogs, said the staff from Northern Light’s Mercy Hospital told him that “20 is better than zero and every little bit helps.”
“We are hoping to do at least one more prior to the end of the season but really we are open to doing as many as they want to do,” Iacuessa said. “They did all of the heavy lifting. We just provided the room to them.”
Shah, the Maine CDC director, said his agency is working closely with doctor’s offices to help them get vaccine doses. Whereas in the past groups of primary care offices had to commit to doing 1,000 doses a week because of scant supplies of vaccine, now Maine CDC is able to ship as few as 20 doses a week to offices that request them.
Shah said the Maine CDC also will be analyzing data, conducting surveys and potentially holding focus groups to get a better sense of who in Maine is still unvaccinated and why. Speaking during last week’s briefing, Shah said there are still barriers that have discouraged or prevented some Mainers from getting a shot and he is committed to helping remove those obstacles.
“In rural counties it may be ideological,” Shah said. “In other places, it may be social determinants: getting time off of work, having transportation, making hours for vaccination sites work for them. Time will tell. It will be an empirical question as much as anything else.”

Texto completo: The National Women's Hockey League champion Boston Pride selected two Massachusetts forwards, Weston's Finley Frechette and Beverly's Abby Nearis, in Tuesday night's NWHL Draft, with Boston College forward Maegan Beres taken third overall to lead a strong New England contingent of draftees.
The Pride didn't choose until the 21st pick in the 30-selection draft, having traded away their choices in the first three rounds. It was in Boston's original first round spot that the Toronto Six chose Beres, a BC captain last season who had just two points in 19 games, but was fourth nationally among forwards in blocked shots.
Her college coach, Katie Crowley, announced the selection.
Still on the board for the Pride was Frechette, a St. Paul's School alumna and 2016 ISL All-Star whose senior season at Cornell was erased by the coronavirus pandemic. The same happened at Brown for Nearis, who went 27th overall. A Kent School product, the 6-foot Nearis was a captain and member of the ECAC All-Academic Team for the Bears.
Quinnipiac's Taylor Girard went with the top selection to the Connecticut Whale, followed by defender Emilie Harley of Robert Morris (to Buffalo) and Beres. The Beauts chose four players with New England connections: Maine defender Anna Zikova (No. 14), former Rivers School forward Missy Segall (No. 15); Holy Cross forward Allison Attea (No. 19); and English defender Casey Traill (No. 25), who played at Castleton University in Vermont.
Among the other choices were Caroline Ross (No. 11, Metropolitan Riveters), who played two seasons at BC before transferring; New Hampshire defender Julia Scammell (No. 17, Metropolitan); Sacred Heart defender Jordan Sanislo (No. 23, Metropolitan); New Hampshire forward Grace Middleton (No. 26, Connecticut); and Maine forward Daria Tereshkina (No. 28, Toronto).

Mainers need fair drug prices - now

Texto completo: The BDN Opinion section operates independently and does not set newsroom policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.com. Jane Margesson is the acting state director of  AARP Maine. Ann Woloson is the executive director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care. There are few political issues that an overwhelming majority of Americans support across party lines. One of the rare exceptions is the need to bring down the prices of prescription drugs. For too long, Americans have paid some of the highest drug prices in the world. Mainers have had to make impossible choices between paying for their medications or other necessities such as rent, utilities or food. Thankfully, our state Legislature has recognized the need for policy that will hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and work to lower prescription prices for Maine. We were encouraged to see the Legislature pass the Making Health Care Work for Maine bill package with overwhelming support. This package provides vital and common sense approaches to reining in escalating drug prices. AARP has been tracking the prices of the most commonly used prescription drugs for well over a decade. The most recent AARP Rx Price Watch Report examined pricing trends among 260 widely used brand name medications. The report found that even in the middle of a global pandemic and financial downturn in 2020, retail prices for these medications increased by an average of 2.9 percent. In contrast, the general inflation rate was 1.3 percent over the same period. Maine has the highest percentage of residents 65 and over in the nation. Across the country, on average, older adults take four or five prescriptions each month, usually due to a chronic illness. With an average annual price tag of $6,600 for just one brand name drug, that quickly adds up to more than the median annual income for people on Medicare. To give one example, a common cancer medication, Revlimid, has more than tripled in price since 2005. These price increases are simply unsustainable. The Maine Health Data Organization reports that more than $165 million was spent by Mainers on the 25 drugs with the highest cost increase over the previous year. These increases affect all of us, through higher health insurance premiums and higher costs of public health coverage programs that help provide health care to our teachers, municipal, community college and university employees. Older Mainers will also likely continue to face increases in what they pay for their prescription drug plans under Medicare. It was estimated that two-thirds of Part D stand-alone drug plan enrollees who were not receiving low-income subsidies could face higher monthly premiums if they kept their current plan in 2020 -- and that, on average, the costs of a monthly premium would more than double. We have heard directly from Mainers about how the high cost of prescription drugs has impacted them and their families. Some shared their very personal stories during the public hearings for the bill package. Susan from Kennebec County is a mom to a daughter who will soon age out of being able to stay on her parents' health plan. Susan's daughter needs a prescription drug that costs nearly $5,000 every other month without which she would likely end up in the hospital. Patricia from Hancock County spoke about her husband, whose only income is a monthly Social Security check. While he watches his diet and does everything he can to control his diabetes, he still needs drugs to control this disease. They charge the costs to Patricia's credit card, thereby incurring an increasing debt. It is time to ensure that all Mainers have access to the life-saving prescription drugs they need. AARP Maine and Consumers for Affordable Health Care applaud the state Legislature for their tireless dedication in passing the Making Health Care Work for Maine package with such strong support. We have come so far in realizing this goal. We thank our legislators for recognizing that Mainers need access to lower drug prices now, and look forward to seeing each of the bills included in the package being passed into law.

Getting vaccinated
Getting vaccinated is the most important thing people can do to help protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccines were made to save lives. They are safe and effective, and they help people's bodies develop immunity to the virus. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines cannot give someone COVID-19 because they do not contain the live virus that causes the illness.
The vaccines prevent nearly 100 percent of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19, and now,  everyone age 12 and older in the U.S. is eligible to be vaccinated for free, regardless of citizenship status. In fact,  over 170 million people in the U.S. have received at least one dose of the vaccine to date.
To find a vaccination provider nearby, people can go to vaccines.gov, text their ZIP code to 438829 on their mobile device, or call 1-800-232-0233.
If someone has been vaccinated, they should encourage others to do so. They can learn about how to talk to their friends and family about getting vaccinated at wecandothis.hhs.gov.
Every person who chooses to get vaccinated brings us a step closer to moving past the pandemic.

Collins' PFAS action
Over the last few years, we've heard a lot about how toxic forever chemicals, called PFAS for short, are destroying farm soils and water sources, and about how they are present in common food items such as milk and dairy products. These chemicals are of grave concern because, as the nickname indicates, they are persistent and once they make it into our bloodstreams, they accumulate.
Exposure to PFAS is shown to cause various serious health issues including cancers, weakened immune systems, thyroid disease, liver damage, fertility issues and hormone disruption. That's why Sen. Susan Collins has taken a recent study, which shows that these chemicals are a common ingredient in cosmetic products, very seriously.
Recently, Collins introduced the bipartisan No PFAS in Cosmetics Act to ban the intentional addition of these toxic chemicals in cosmetics. This bill should absolutely pass with flying colors. There is no reason for products intended to be applied to our skin, face and hair to include toxic chemicals with known serious health risks.

Gun safety and storage
I support the concept discussed in the BDN ("Janet Mills and Jared Golden's safe-storage push shows middle ground approach on guns" from June 25) regarding grants for distribution of firearm-locking materials and educational material on gun safety. Education around the issue of safe firearm storage is sorely needed in our state, as the recent spate of incidents involving children and firearms proves. Also needed are clarity and accountability in our laws, such as what is spelled out in LD 759, An Act to Amend the Child Endangerment Laws to Include Certain Unauthorized Access to a Loaded Firearm, which I sponsored.
At that bill's public hearing, testimonies from gun owners, educators, physicians, and law enforcement reinforced the need for a safe storage law in Maine, such as what is found on the books in  27   other state s. Testimony from one mother, whose child went to play at a friend's house and was killed when the two accessed an unsecured firearm, was particularly powerful.
This scenario is a legitimate fear of Maine parents, one that I have heard from my constituents, and is what started me on my journey to pass a safe storage law in our state. Safe storage saves lives, and LD 759 would make clear that unsecured, loaded firearms pose a real danger to children under 16. Combined with education around this issue and incentives for safe storage devices, LD 759 can make Maine children safer and quell every parent's worst nightmare.

RETURN TO ACTION -- Josh Harvey , left, and Dominic Jones battle during their mixed martial arts bout as part of NEF 40 in September 2019 at the Collins Center of the Arts on the campus of the University of Maine in  Orono. NEF will hold its first show since the start of the pandemic in August in Milford, New Hampshire.
By Ernie Clark, Bangor Daily News Staff
The Ultimate Fighting Championship was the first major sports franchise to resume operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, initially with fanless shows based mainly in Las Vegas and on an island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The world's top mixed martial arts promotion -- whose president Dana White is a 1987 Hermon High School graduate -- could afford the lack of ticket revenue because of its five-year, $1.5 billion television deal with ESPN.
Smaller, regional mixed martial efforts without such resources have not been as fortunate and 16 months after being shut down are now just starting to reemerge as mass-gathering and social-distancing limits have been eased.
That includes New England Fights, a Maine-based promotion that has relied heavily on Pine Tree State competitors since debuting at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston in February 2012 but has been silent since hosting NEF 42 at Portland's Merrill Auditorium on Feb. 20, 2020.
NEF will hold its first show since then on Aug. 21 at the Hampshire Dome in Milford, New Hampshire, then hopes to follow that up soon after with a return to Maine, where it hosted 41 of its first 42 shows before NEF 43 was postponed indefinitely in June 2020.
"It's definitely been challenging for everybody," said Matt Peterson of Rumford, a former state legislator and co-owner of NEF with Massachusetts attorney Nick DiSalvo. "I certainly had my share of naysayers who thought [the coronavirus] would result in the death of the sport here, who thought a regional promotion like ours would never come back.
"I didn't know when, but I knew eventually it would come back. I wish it had been a lot sooner, but we can only work with what we're allowed and hopefully it's smoother sailing from here."
What had been a vibrant mixed martial scene throughout New England before the pandemic has been slow to rebound.
The only shows held since the pandemic's arrival to date have involved empty arenas and connections with major television or live-streaming outlets.
A show promoted by Classic Entertainment & Sports, better known as CES, in Warwick, Rhode Island, last October was live-streamed on UFC Fight Pass, while Bellator -- considered the sport's second-biggest MMA promotion -- has hosted nationally televised shows at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut.
But that's beginning to change. Bellator has announced it will open its events to at least a limited number of fans beginning with Bellator 261 at Mohegan Sun Friday night, and the Massachusetts-based Cage Titans Fighting Championship has scheduled a July 10 show in Plymouth, Massachusetts.
"It's not lost on me that every business was touched by this in some capacity, every person was affected in some way," Peterson said. "I know we're just one small piece of it but we were certainly in the trenches with everyone else."
NEF 44 will be the promotion's first card in New Hampshire and that state's first MMA show since COVID-19 arrived, though the Granite State has hosted several boxing events since last fall.
"Fighters and fans have waited long enough," said DiSalvo in announcing plans for NEF 44 on June 7. "With Maine not fully open for combat sports events yet, the Hampshire Dome and the New Hampshire Boxing Commission presented the perfect opportunity to get fighters back in the cage and active again before summer was over."
Peterson has been communicating with state officials and the Combat Sports Authority of Maine in an effort to get approval to resume shows in Maine, and while he said that has been frustrating at times he is confident NEF will return to its home turf soon.
"We'll be back in the fall, for certain," he said.
Among those eager to compete again is Josh Harvey, a Dexter Regional High School School graduate who trains at Primo Bellarosa's Vision Quest Muay Thai and Fitness in Newport and will take a 7-1-1 professional record into his return to the cage at NEF 44.
"This couldn't have come at a better time or at a worse time considering my last fight was my first loss and I've been able to stew on that ever since," Harvey said. "But it's been good because instead of just training for fight after fight as if I were fighting every two or three months, the time off has allowed me to actually grow as a martial artist and not just be getting into shape for a fight."
Harvey has been training regularly since Vision Quest opened to a limited capacity last November, and he plans to spend time in July at South Tampa Jiu-Jitsu in Florida training with the likes of UFC regulars Calvin Kattar and Rob Font.
Another Mainer set to appear at NEF 44 is Lewiston's Brandon Maillet-Fevens, who will battle Nathanial Grimard of Exeter, New Hampshire, for the vacant NEF amateur featherweight championship in a matchup originally scheduled for NEF 43.
"It's been a long year and a half," Maillet-Fevens said, "but we never stopped working, never stopped perfecting our skills because we knew this day was coming."
One question that awaits promotions like NEF is whether the hiatus from competition will prompt other mixed martial arts competitors to give up the grueling sport.
"I've been in touch with a lot of people throughout the entire quarantine period and had a lot of people expressing what a challenge it was to stay motivated and stay in shape when gyms were closed down, to continue to develop their skill set without the framework of competition throughout the year," Peterson said.
"I think what COVID ultimately is going to do in that sense is find out which people are really serious and hungry and want to excel and accelerate to the next level, while others probably are going to fall by the wayside."

Summertime shooting keeps skills sharp

Texto completo: Shooting is a degenerative skill; whether you favor a bow, handgun, rifle or shotgun, abilities decline with lack of practice. It's just like playing any musical instrument; any period of neglect will lead to a notable deterioration in competence. It's not the piano or guitar that changes, and it's not the gun, scope or cartridge. It's the operator's comfort and familiarity.
That said, shooters need to make a special effort to head to the range this summer and not postpone efforts until hunting season arrives this fall.
There are a surprising number of shooters who don't hunt; and a lot of others who chase upland birds or perhaps waterfowl but have no interest in big game. Regardless of plinking metal targets, shooting holes in paper or busting flying clay targets, whichever you choose involves fresh air, sunshine and the now-vogue social distancing. Practicing marksmanship not only involves hands-on gun safety, comfort of handling and establishing muscle memory that will carry over into "meat on the table" outings, it's just plain fun for family and friends.
Many Aroostook towns and villages have Fish and Game or Rod and Gun clubs that have been established for decades. Some have trap and skeet fields, a couple boast sporting clays courses, and most have bench rest shooting ranges of at least 100 yards. A few clubs feature rifle ranges at 200 and 300 yards for big-game rifles and long-range varmint guns, and some even feature a short 50-yard range for .22s and handguns.
If you travel downstate there are even indoor shooting clubs that operate year around. There's a chance for Mom and the youngsters to join Dad for some plinking, winter or summer. Under current COVID-19 conditions and social distancing guidelines, staying near home makes family shooting outings a better idea. Crown of Maine outdoor enthusiasts enjoy the options of lots of wide open fields and woodlots nearby; some may even be family-owned.
There's bound to be a safe location on your own land, or a friend or nearby farmer who will give permission for a shooting session. Any selected location obviously needs to be away from houses, farm buildings and machinery, roads, ATV and hiking trails. It's also essential to have a raised backdrop like a hill or thick woods to stop bullets from going astray. To this end, Aroostook agri-land abounds with hundreds of gravel pits, every shape and size, and from years of personal experience I've found these high walled enclosures to be safe shooting locales.
Whatever location you chose for a plinking session, leave it in better shape than you found it. Do not use glass containers as targets. It's dangerous on so many levels. Gather and pack out your cans and paper targets, pick up your brass or shotgun shells, and if you use wooden frames or cardboard backdrops, take them with you.
While I do like to fire a few rounds from my hunting rifles to stay comfortable and familiar, I'd much rather enjoy the reduced cost of ammunition and milder recoil and noise of my .22 rifle or handgun. Everyone in the family can have fun with this favorite old caliber. The same basics for mounting, steadying, righting, breathing and trigger controls are utilized and will easily transfer to larger hunting guns when the time comes.
For shotgunners who want to powder a few fast-flying clay pigeons, it's not necessary to visit a commercial site. A simple hand thrower will suffice or a multi-bird mechanical machine that can be staked into the ground or attached to a vehicle bumper or trailer hitch. Prices range from $10 for a handheld to a couple of hundred for a good, multifunction, long-lasting middle-of-the-field machine. Then all you need is a secluded field.
Some scattergunners insist on using the guns they prefer to hunt with, usually a 12 gauge; but I try to save money on shells and a bruised shoulder by opting for a 20 gauge, or even a 28 or .410. The youngsters and smaller-framed women will like these lighter shotguns as well, and busting and dusting clay targets is a bit more a challenge with the lighter loads.
There are plenty of commercial targets -- metal animal silhouettes that clang and fall over when struck, some that spin and even a few that fall then reappear. Newer paper targets feature high-visibility colors that appear when a bullet strikes, and even have self-sticking dots to cover holes for reuse over and over. I'm still happy with a package of paper plates, tape and a staple gun.
For the kids, it's fun to blow up colored balloons, or fill a couple of plastic bottles with colored water. Once in a while I'll take a tomato or carrot from the garden or an apple from my tree and hang it from a string for an extra challenge. It's all fun and there's an underlying teaching experience for future hunters.
Current restrictions limit a lot of activities for old and young alike, so why not get out in nature with an age-old pastime that is literally a page in Maine's outdoor hunting heritage? A summer shooting outing will have a lot of benefits for all involved.

Officiating shortage looms ahead of Maine high school football's fall return

Texto completo: By Ernie Clark, Bangor Daily News Staff
The prospect of a return to high school sports as usual this fall revives a question that's been posed during the best of times in recent years.
Who will officiate the games?
A shortage of game officials in virtually every interscholastic sport has become a growing challenge not only in Maine, but around the country.
The National Federation of State High School Associations launched a recruiting campaign for prospective sports officials in 2017, but the shortfall lingers and may be exacerbated this coming school year by COVID-19.
In Maine, opportunities for people interested in reconnecting with competitive sports through becoming an official abound.
"It's not just football, it's everything," said Maine commissioner of officials Jeff Benson, who estimated that as many as 30 to 40 percent of the officials statewide did not work during the recently completed school year. "Soccer, football, field hockey, we have a need for officials in everything we have coming up for the fall."
Football, among other sports, has dealt with a gradually reduced, aging membership among its officials, and it now faces possible further reductions from officials who choose not to return after sitting out last fall due to COVID concerns or chose or opting not to officiate non-tackle versions of the sport that were offered when tackle football was sidelined after being considered high risk in state community sports guidelines.
The Bangor chapter of the Maine Association of Football Officials, which provides officials for high-school, middle-school and youth football programs throughout the northern half of the state, began last year with 60 officials available to work games.
This year, chapter assignor Doug Ferguson said that, as of June 24, only 47 officials are expected to be available.
"The numbers are way down," said Dan Campbell, a veteran football and baseball official who will teach the Bangor chapter's annual class for new officials that begins Aug. 12. "People are retiring each year. Some of the guys that retired coming into this season really wanted to retire two years ago and they came back for another year and then COVID last year really put a damper on a lot of things."
Whether that chapter or others around the state are able to field a sufficient number of game officials on their own may hinge on the availability of those members who chose not to work games in 2020.
"In speaking with some of the assignors and knowing how many people were out in the fall and the winter, I think the biggest question is how many of those people who sat out are going to return to us and not opt out again," Benson said.
"That will be the big challenge for us and our officiating boards. How many of those officials that opted out will come back so we can provide the service we need to do for the schools?"
A shortage could be addressed in a couple of ways.
One is sharing officials with neighboring chapters, a practice which has been used occasionally in recent years.
"There's one night this fall when we'll need 50 officials and another night when we'll need 55," Ferguson said. "We do use officials from other boards to help out."
Another option is for some games to be worked by four-official crews rather than the preferred five-person crews, though that places added demands on the smaller crews.
"The keys are different and the responsibility [for each official] increases because you have more to look for," Campbell said. "The fewer officials, the more you're not going to be able to see because you have more responsibility as you're scanning your keys.
"It's a big deal going from five to four."
That's particularly true on pass plays, as the fifth official typically is the back judge, whose responsibilities include working in concert with the wing officials to cover plays downfield.
"But with a four-man crew you only have the two [wing] officials out there so something right down the middle of the field is tougher," Ferguson said. "Plus, we're not as young as we used to be. We're an aging board, so it's easier to get out of position when you're 62 years old than it is when you're 32. And the kids seem to get faster every year."
The longer-term solution to this annual dilemma is to attract new officials, but that has been a tough challenge in Maine and beyond.
"In my opinion, the number one reason why people are not attracted to officiating is because social media is very quick to criticize," Campbell said, adding that people are quick to criticize.
"But what keeps you coming back is the love of the game, the sport, and the enjoyment that I take from seeing the kids get it, have fun and just having that whole experience."
Campbell added that the teamwork involved in officiating creates a unique level of camaraderie among peers.
"You go out on a Friday night with four other guys and you bring in conversations from all walks of life," he said. "Everybody's got a story to tell on the way to the game, and on the way back you share the experience of what you just went through."
Anyone interested in taking the free prospective officials' course through the Bangor chapter of the Maine Association of Football Officials may sign up by contacting Campbell at 207-478-0822 or dcampbell@rsu71.org.

Jared Entwistle is a graduate student studying ecology and environmental sciences and business administration at The University of Maine. This column reflects his views and expertise and does not speak on behalf of the university.

Members' columns appear in the BDN every other week.
In April 2020, and for the third time in a week, my roommates and I reviewed the list of restaurants still open for takeout service. We were hungry and the local grocery store had been emptied of our favorite Friday night foods for weeks. As a household that tries to be conscious of our environmental and economic impact, this presented a dilemma: helping out local restaurants by ordering takeout also meant we would likely send several containers to the landfill.
For many of us, convenience and a sense of comradery won out in this dilemma. Prior to the pandemic, we would have reused the takeout containers, but increased calls to our local eateries overwhelmed our storage abilities. Reflecting on this has made me wonder "if a restaurant can reuse a plate, why can't they reuse a takeout container?" For that matter, why can't all packaging be reused?
The first few months of the pandemic produced a massive amount of trash. While some noticed the build-up in their houses, others noticed it on the streets. But the largest disruptions hit municipalities, where certain districts noticed waste increases as high as  50 percent.
In Maine, the pandemic has posed a particular challenge to our waste reduction goals and distracted us from our hierarchy of methods to reduce waste. Yet, according to Maine's 2021 Generation and Disposal Capacity Report, per capita waste generation was growing even before the lockdowns. This was partly due to China's so-called "National Sword" policy, which highlighted the inherent issues of single-sort recycling as much of that material was rerouted to local processors, who struggled to keep up.
Additionally, takeout and online purchases increased by 15 percent leading into 2020. Tragically, we were already heading towards a 50 percent increase in waste, the pandemic just got us there faster.
While a lot of attention has been paid to the lower end of the waste hierarchy (recycling and composting) by finding compostable or biodegradable plastics, there are problems with these solutions. The first issue is that these strategies won't reduce the amount of waste, but simply replace one waste material for another. This wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't for the fact that many of these "green" packaging products aren't any better for the environment and don't break down as intended.
Recently, reusable packaging systems have started to rise in popularity. Reusable packages have been used in shipping and manufacturing to good success, providing proof that we have the technology and materials to implement reusable systems safely and effectively. So why haven't we? While durable products that can be reused do take more resources to produce, the ability to reuse a package, even just a few times, causes its per-use environmental impact to be much less than the equivalent amount of disposable packaging.
There are other challenges, too. The food service industry and local governments will need to adopt updated food safety protocols, ensuring containers are reused safely. Customers will need to participate in the return process. Our mindset towards packaging will need to shift.
But -- if enough of us takeout aficionados participate -- we can significantly reduce food packaging waste. In total, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that  23 percent of American waste is made up of disposable packaging, a large portion of which is food containers. If we all had the option to transition from a consumer into an active patron earlier in the pandemic, maybe we wouldn't have seen such an uptick in waste creation. For my part, it would definitely have made ordering out less of a dilemma knowing that the packaging I was using wouldn't wind up as somebody else's problem.

Texto completo: Registration for the Maine Woods Rambler -- a gravel ride scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 26 in and around Millinocket -- has opened, the Bicycle Coalition of Maine announced.
Co-hosted by Katahdin Area Trails, the Rambler will feature two fully supported and marked gravel routes open exclusively for this event which will be held at the New England Outdoor Center on the shores of Millinocket Lake.
"We are excited to offer riders what we are calling a 'wilderness bike adventure' featuring challenging routes over mixed terrain, breathtaking views and even a water crossing via ferry on the longer ride," said Bicycle Coalition of Maine Event Director Will Elting.
Participants can choose between 50 kilometer or 100 kilometer options, and the event also includes a complimentary post-ride cookout and optional activities like mountain biking, rafting, kayaking, hiking and fishing.
Registration is $90 regardless of which route is selected, and on-ride support includes maps, rest stops, SAG vehicles and mechanical and medical assistance. Lodging is not included in the fee, but camping at NEOC and local accommodations are available.
The Coalition says the Rambler will be capped at 150 riders. Registration and additional information is available at bikemaine.org/the-maine-woods-rambler.

Texto completo: Y a estaba tarde and Canutito was very tired.
Había trabajão y trabajão all day long trying to do his homework pero - por alguna razón - he just couldn't hacer ningún progreso. Primero he had tried de figurar su arithmetic pero no podía hacer add up todos los números . And until he could finish su addition, no podía comenzar con sus fractions.
Usually Grama Cuca podía hacer find alguna manera para ayudar porque ella era muy creative. Pero hoy, she had gone to offer help a la vecina quien había tenido un baby y no podía hacer nada.
Grama Cuca always offered her help a todas las personas; it was just su naturaleza . Era como un angel of mercy.
Canutito estaba all alone en la cocina con el grampo pero he was worse than Canutito was at understanding todo ese "new math."
As Grampo Caralampio sat there leyendo el papel, out of the corner del ojo, vio que el muchito estaba struggling. He volunteered, "M'hijo, whenever I am doing something y yo no puedo hacer progreso , I just put it aside y hago work en algotra cosa before I come back to the original work. Usually la problema se hace resolve sola."
Canutito had almost given up trying to come up con la idea del grampo cuando de repente Grama Cuca came back por la puerta de la cocina exclaiming que la neighbor lady estaba mejor y ya no necesitaba her help.
Right away Canutito sacó su geography book y le dijo a la grama: "Grama, tengo que aprender dónde están todos los Estados de los United States of America y no sé cómo comenzar."
Grama Cuca sat down y dijo: "Es la cosa más fácil en el mundo, m'hijo," she smiled.
Y luego she called Grampo Caralampio y le dijo: "Viejo, let me borrow you por un momento. El Canutito needs to learn los nombres de todos los states in the union y necesitamos un visual aid. Tú vas a ser un map of the United States so párate allí front and center con tus brazos y tus piernas spread far apart como un mapa."
Grampo Caralampio no sabía que hacer pero he did as Grama Cuca ordered him to do with his arms and legs spread apart.
She pointed to his left hand and she said to Canutito: "¿Cómo se dice 'hand' in Spanish?"
He answered: "Mano."
"Good," she said. "Entonces ese state se llama 'Maine' como la 'mano.'" Canutito smiled.
"Now," she said, what letter is formed por el shape del 'elbow'?"
Canutito looked down y dijo : "Es una 'V.'"
"Bueno," Grama Cuca said. "The state below Maine es Vermont como la 'V.'" Now she pointed to Grampo's heart y preguntó, "¿Cómo se dice 'heart' en español, m'hijo?"
"Heart in Spanish is 'corazón,' Grama," Canutito replied.
"Bueno," said Grama. " La 'C' en corazón stands por la first letter en 'Connecticut.'"
Canutito realized que él estaba aprendiendo las locations y los nombres de los United States uno a la vez just by looking al mapa humano del grampo. Estaba bien excited porque he was learning geografía al modo de la grama.
He asked her: "Grama, ¿dónde está Florida?"
Grama Cuca replied: "Florida es un estado largo toward the bottom left del mapa and it points un poco pa'l lão and down."
Grampo Caralampio se hizo colorão, colorão and he quickly se puso las manos en la bragueta exclaiming: "Es todo para ahora - no more geography lessons!"
He sat down quickly y ya no miraba pa'arriba, preferring mejor de esconderse behind the newspaper.

Auburn Police Chief Stephen Smyc has received a ‘thank you letter from the Auburn Fire Department. Friday during heavy rain, communications were out for a period of time at Central Station and police assisted in setting up temporary communications, by way of walkie talkies. The letter from Deputy Harry A Berry reads as follows: I wish to highly commend the members of your department for their cooperation and fine assistance rendered to the Fire Department during the communications emergency Friday night, Oct 23. In my opinion, this is an outstanding example of Public Service at its best. Two calls for fires in buildings were received during the emergency and without the cooperation and assistance mentioned above large losses would have occurred to the owners, occupants and to the city. Chief Giberti is on vacation and upon his return to duty, I know that he will be more than pleased to learn of the results of the emergency operations.

Cutesy baby outfits are nice, but what expectant mothers really need at their baby showers are health and safety tips, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday. Mrs. Clinton, who is writing a parenting book, told an audience of mothers and expectant mothers that some people question the need for her book, claiming parents already know what to do. “And I said, ‘Well, I didn’t. I didn’t get an instruction manual when my daughter was born. Much of it was trial by error and, luckily, I had family and friends and other people who were there for me telling me what I needed to do to keep my baby safe and healthy.'”

Texto completo: LEWISTON — After coming off Friday’s loss to the Northeast Generals, the Maine Nordiques relied on veteran presence Saturday night.
The Nordiques split the weekend series with the Generals with a 3-1 victory at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee.
Isaiah Fox, Stefan Owens and Caden Pattison, all three returning players from the 2019-20 team scored in the victory.
“Veteran guys coming through again. They know what it takes to win in this league and they weren’t going to let us be denied,” Nordiques coach Nolan Howe said.
The Generals opened the scoring in the first period when University of New Hampshire commit Aidan Curran put the initial shot on goal from the left circle. Nordiques goaltender Avery Sturtz made the save with his left pad, but the rebound kicked into the slot, where Liam McCanney sent the puck into the half-open net.
The goal came eight minutes into the period.
Howe was pleased with Sturtz’s 33-save effort in the game, including making that initial save on McCanney’s goal.
“That’s on us,” Howe said. “He made an unbelievable first save. We have to clean up our net-front coverage. Again, all three goals they scored this weekend were in front of our cage. We will work on that Monday and get ourselves ready for (the) Danbury (Jr. Hat Tricks on Tuesday).”
Maine (7-2-0, 14 points) started the second period strong as defenseman James Philpott found Fox heading into the offensive zone and Fox’s backhand shot slid through Hugo Haas’ five-hole to tie the game.
The tally came 73 seconds into the middle frame.
Fox just committed to Long Island University this past week, the newest NCAA Division I hockey program.
Fox continued to attack the net in the second period. Maine commit Tyler Gaulin found Fox on a 2-on-1 where Fox dove at a puck that just went over the crossbar. Haas was able to stop Fox later in the period on a breakaway.
In the third period, Fox found his linemate Stefan Owens in the slot and Owens fired the puck past Haas to give the Nordiques a 2-1 lead. Just like the second period, it was a quick goal, just 94 seconds into the period.
“I was looking for Gaulin honestly for a pass,” Owens said. “When the defenseman slid over I pulled (the puck) back and shot it. Thankfully it went in.”
Gaulin joined the top line with Owens and Fox while Cannon Green went to the second line with Aiden Connolly and Ignat Belov. Belov took Reese Farrell’s place on the second line as Farrell was a scratch Saturday.
“We are trying to find something different that might work for the team,” Owens said. “I guess it did today.”
The Nordiques looked to extend the lead with about seven minutes remaining in the game, but Haas made two point-blank saves on Green.
Haas made 31 saves.
The Generals (2-5-0, 4 points) pressured in the final two-plus minutes as they had two offensives zones faceoffs. The second faceoff came with 36 seconds remaining. They ran a set play but the shot went wide.
Caden Pattison capped the game with an empty net goal with one second remaining.
The Nordiques were 0-for-1 on the man advantage while the Generals were 0-for-2.
Howe liked the team’s discipline on the weekend as the two penalties Saturday were the only two they took all weekend.
“It was something we wanted to focus on coming into the year,” Howe said. “We play fast and we are in peoples faces and we try to do it legally. We try to play between the whistles and I was proud of our discipline this weekend.”
Maine hosts the Danbury Jr. Hat Tricks on Tuesday at 7 p.m.

TURNER — Leavitt junior midfielder Eve Martineau offered a reasonable explanation for the Hornets’ three-goal surge in the fourth quarter of Saturday morning’s field hockey game with St. Dom’s.
“We had a bit of a rough third quarter.” said Martineau, who earned an assist and watched her Hornets upend St. Dom’s 4-2. “I think once a couple of people really wanted it then everybody else sees that and then we just worked really hard in that last quarter.”
“I think we played a really good game. I think we played really hard,” she said. “We had a lot of little passes that we are trying to focus on and then we really moved the ball.”
The score was tied 1-1 heading into the third quarter. The Saints, who continued to press hard, conjured up their second goal when sophomore forward Isabella Pelletier scored her second goal on Lorelei Bonney’s assist with just 14 seconds left in the quarter.
But the Hornets used a young group of athletes and opened up on the Saints in the fourth quarter with a blistering, unanswered three-goal rally.
“We played Lewiston yesterday so we were dragging a little bit early in that third quarter,” Leavitt coach Wanda Ward-MacLean said. “The kids were really disappointed in themselves. We put a couple of subs in that hadn’t played very much in the game so they had a little more energy. So that kind of of sparked us.
“Overall, I think we did well,” the coach said. “We made some nice passes in the circle. We were touching the ball a lot. Earlier in the game, we were hitting the ball at the goalie instead of tipping it around her. We really improved on that as the game went on.”
Leavitt sophomore midfielder/forward Jazzlyn Clark tied the game with her first goal thanks to senior midfielder Ginny Twitchell’s feed. With the score tied at 2-2, there were signs that the teams might be heading into overtime.
With 5:16 left in the game, sophomore forward Cierra Barker set up the next two crucial Leavitt goals to collect back-to-back assists late in the final stanza.
Freshman forward Emma Beady scored Leavitt’s go-ahead goal with 5:16 left in the game, allowing the Hornets to overtake Saints with a 3-2 lead.
For insurance purposes, Clark knocked in her second goal 42 seconds later, giving the Hornets breathing room and a 4-2 victory.
St. Dom’s struck first, with Pelletier scoring her first goal on junior forward Julianne Cook’s assist at with 3:52 left in the first quarter. The Hornets tied the game two-and-a-half minutes latter on a Twitchell goal with assistance from Martineau. Leavitt goalie Paige DeMascio got the win in net.
“The first three quarters we were up and competing with them,” St. Dom’s coach Abigail Bowie said. “It was definitely like an equally matched game and then these things happen, and in the last quarter, sometimes you can’t finish.
“But I think the effort that they put forward was really, really great,” she added. “I think the girls really put in an A+ effort and they should not hang their heads.”

Texto completo: Oct. 31, 1879: Prolific Maine author Jacob Abbott dies at 75 in Farmington, where he resided. Abbott produced 180 books, consisting of works of juvenile fiction, history, biography, religion and science. Many of them were translated into other languages.
<img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-13690530 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/Me200-Verticle-SMALL-e1577809540930.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="161" />
The Hallowell native, Bowdoin College graduate and ordained minister taught mathematics and natural philosophy for four years at Amherst College, then directed the Mount Vernon Female School in Boston. He organized a Congregational church in 1834 in Roxbury, Massachusetts, then left it in the care of his brother John Abbott.
While still a young man, he moved to Farmington, where his brother Samuel Abbott had founded the Abbott Family School for Boys at Little Blue. Samuel Abbott died a few years later, so Jacob Abbott took over its management briefly with his sisters. They sold it and moved across the road to Few Acres, which remained their home after that, although Abbott spent winters in New York.
Abbott’s brothers John Abbott and Gorham Dummer Abbott also were authors, as were his sons, Benjamin, Austin, Lyman and Edward.

Outdoors in Maine: Everything under the sun, or moon, about deer rut peaks

Texto completo: For Maine residents, the firearms season for deer began Saturday, Oct. 31. All other deer hunters can legally start their deer a hunt a half-hour before sunrise on Monday, Nov. 2.
Many sportsmen count the November deer hunt as the highlight of all of their outdoor passions. It is a special time. Frosty mornings and quiet moments in a tree stand with hand warmers, a thermos of hot coffee mixed with the anticipation of a big buck in the crosshairs is a deer hunter’s daydream. Or, for the most hardy and driven among the hunt fraternity, the dream is to follow a big track on fresh snow.
And, of course, the Maine deer camp is also the centerpiece of the hunt, part of the heritage and the history. These camps come in all sizes and description and locales, many of them passed along from generation to generation, along with unique histories and huntin’ yarns that get carried on year after year.
A mouse in the corner — a graying one that has been hiding in the food bin for more than a year or two — knows that many of the same old topics get worked over at the card tables year after year. Among them: the best deer gun, the time of day that bucks move, tracking methods, and the Daddy of them all, when is the peak period of the all-important rut?
In general, if you can figure out what time of the month the rut is at its peak, you stand the best chance of catching a buck when he is distracted with his guard down and his focus is not on danger. Since there is only educated guesswork about rut times, mixed with some well-grounded anecdotal evidence, the deer rut can be the subject of spirited debate at deer camp.
There are two clear schools of thought on this subject. The conventional wisdom of highly respected wildlife biologists like Gerry Lavigne is straightforward and has nothing to do with the moon phases. Lavigne will tell you, unequivocally, that the rut always peaks on November 15th year after year, period. This theory holds that the breeding season is guided or dependent upon the length of daylight.
The more romantic theory, if you will, is that the rut, although occurring over a period of 40 days, has a “sweet spot” that lasts about 10 days. This is the lunar theory as articulated by well-known deer researcher Charles Alsheimer from Bath, New York. In a chapter in his book titled “Anatomy of the Rut,” Alsheimer postulates that the whitetail rut is regulated by the lunar cycle.
He theorizes that the Rutting Moon, or the Hunter’s Moon, determines the sweet spot, which begins three days after the Rutting Moon and lasts, as said earlier, about 10 days. Unlike the Lavigne rutting theory, this lunar theory dictates a different rut peak year after year, and takes a little calculation on the hunter’s part. For example, the Rutting Moon is always the second full moon after the autumnal equinox. Last fall the Rutting Moon fell on Nov. 12, which put the sweet spot in mid-November, about the same as Lavigne’s date for the rut peak. This fall, however, the second full moon is 12 days earlier, Oct. 31!
So what does this mean? It really depends upon which theory you elect to go with, lunar cycle or length of day. If you opt for the lunar theory and really want to maximize your odds for catching a rutting buck in deep distraction, you might want to reconsider the date you have set for your hunt week vacation. If Alsheimer is right, the buck of your dreams is more likely to make a mistake in your favor from Nov. 3-Nov 13.
One other thing: If you really want to “play the numbers,” and you have a tree stand in good deer country, be in that stand every day at 8 a.m. on Nov. 6,7,9 and 10.
Good luck, and hunt safely!

Prosecutors in Connecticut said Friday that they would not retry Michael Skakel for the killing of his 15-year-old neighbor 45 years ago, ending a case that transfixed much of the country and went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 2002, Skakel, a cousin of the Kennedys, was convicted of beating Martha Moxley to death with a golf club in 1975 when they were both 15 and living in Greenwich, Connecticut.
In 2018, his conviction was overturned by the state’s highest court.
On Friday, prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to try Skakel again.
“It is my belief that the state cannot prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt,” Richard Colangelo Jr. said Friday in state Superior Court.
He said that of 51 potential witnesses, 17 were dead and there was no additional forensic evidence in the case.
Skakel, now 60, was initially sentenced to 20 years to life for murder and spent more than a decade behind bars. He was released in 2013 after a judge vacated the sentence, ruling that his lawyer had not provided effective representation.
In 2016, the state Supreme Court reinstated the conviction but later reviewed its decision after a request from the defense.
In 2018, the same court said that Skakel’s lawyer, Michael Sherman, did not present evidence of an alibi. The court called Sherman’s failure to obtain such evidence “constitutionally inexcusable.” It said that it undermined “confidence in the reliability” of the conviction.
The announcement by prosecutors of their decision Friday coincided with the 45th anniversary of the killing, which set off decades of speculation and legal twists and turns that became fodder for tabloids, books and television movies.
OCT. 30, 1975
Moxley fails to show up at home after roaming her neighborhood in Greenwich with friends. Her body is found bludgeoned and stabbed, half-hidden beneath pine trees. A broken golf club found nearby is believed to have been used in the killing. The killing rattles the town, which is considered extremely safe.
JUNE 1977
Nearly two years after the teenager’s death, many Greenwich residents wonder why a broad police investigation has yielded no arrests. Martha was last seen alive on the lawn of a friend, Thomas Skakel, 17, Michael’s older brother. The brothers are nephews of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy. The police trace the golf club used in the killing to the collection of the Skakel family. Thomas and another young man are considered suspects, although both pass lie detector tests.
1978-1980
For two years, Michael Skakel attends the Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine, a private institution which, at the time, catered to children with mental health and substance abuse problems. According to numerous accounts, Skakel blurted out during a group-therapy session that he had killed Moxley. But Joe Ricci, the school’s owner, denied that such a confession had occurred.
EARLY JUNE 1998
A book written by Mark Fuhrman, a former Los Angeles police detective known for his role in the O.J. Simpson case, singles out Skakel as the likely killer, reigniting interest in the case two decades later.
MID-JUNE TO AUGUST 1998
The state of Connecticut appoints an investigator and a one-man grand jury in the Moxley case. Soon after, a possible break in the investigation surfaces when a former suspect, Kenneth Littleton, who lived next door to Moxley, testifies before the grand jury in exchange for immunity. The focus now falls on Thomas and Michael Skakel, but both deny involvement in the killing. Then a close Skakel family friend and a neighbor of Martha’s, Mildred Ix, talks to the grand jury. Her daughter, Helen, then 15, had been with Martha, Thomas and Michael, then 15, the night of the killing.
SEPTEMBER 1998
Ricci, the Elan School director, refuses to testify during grand jury proceedings. Prosecutors contend that Ricci “overheard Michael Skakel make admissions to the murder of Martha Moxley,” according to court papers filed in Maine.
JAN. 19, 2000
Nearly a quarter-century after Moxley was killed, the police charge Michael Skakel, now 39, with murder as a minor because he was 15 at the time of the October 1975 killing.
MARCH 15, 2000
Amid a news media stakeout reminiscent of the Simpson trial, Skakel appears in court to face the charge that he murdered his neighbor. After the hearing concludes, he walks to the railing by the first row of spectators and stands face-to-face with Moxley’s mother, Dorthy. “I feel your pain,” he says, looking Dorthy Moxley in the eyes. “But you’ve got the wrong guy.”
JUNE 21, 2000
Two witnesses who were both former classmates of Skakel’s at the Elan School testify. One of them, John Higgins, describes a confused and tearful admission in which Skakel said he had only fragmented memories of the crime. The other witness, Gregory Coleman, says Skakel brazenly told him: “I am going to get away with murder. I am a Kennedy.”
FEB. 1, 2001
A judge orders Skakel to be tried as an adult, noting that Connecticut’s juvenile system was not equipped to punish a 40-year-old defendant. Skakel was charged as a juvenile because he was 15 at the time of the killing. Conviction as an adult could carry a life sentence, while conviction by a juvenile court judge would mean little or no jail time.
JUNE 8, 2002
During the trial, the jury is offered no direct physical evidence linking Skakel to the crime but hears testimony about incriminating statements and erratic behavior from Skakel over the years. As the clerk polls each juror, the victim’s mother, Dorthy Moxley, and her son, John, clutch each other in their front-row seats, astonished smiles on their faces, tears in their eyes.
AUG. 30, 2002
After he tearfully insists that he is innocent, Skakel is sentenced to a prison term of 20 years to life. Just before the sentencing, he gives a rambling 10-minute statement full of biblical references, proclaiming his innocence and his faith in God. It was the first time he had spoken during his trial.
NOV. 23, 2003
Skakel’s lawyers challenge the conviction on seven grounds, including whether the prosecution inflamed the jury by referring to the defendant as a “spoiled brat” and whether Skakel should have been tried as an juvenile since he was 15 at the time of the killing.
JAN. 13, 2006
An appeals court rejects a variety of arguments advanced by Skakel’s lawyers.
OCT. 23, 2013
A Connecticut judge orders a new trial for Skakel, saying his original lawyer had not represented him effectively.
NOV. 21, 2013
After spending more than a decade behind bars for the killing of Moxley, Skakel is ordered free on bail. Judge Gary White of Stamford Superior Court, speaking in a courtroom packed with family and friends of both Skakel and the victim, sets bail at $1.2 million.
FEBRUARY 2016
Hubert Santos, a lawyer for Skakel, tells a panel of six justices on the Connecticut Supreme Court that he deserves a retrial. The lawyer says that Skakel’s older brother, Thomas Skakel, was the most likely perpetrator of one of the state’s most notorious crimes.
State prosecutors say that Michael Skakel does not deserve a new trial and that his conviction should be reinstated.
JULY 2016
Skakel’s cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former prosecutor and environmental lawyer, releases a book titled “Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent Over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn’t Commit.”
The book explores what Kennedy says was a botched police investigation as well as prosecutorial misconduct, and plumbs alternate theories of who killed the girl. It claims to have definitively solved the killing, identifying two Bronx teenagers.
DEC. 30, 2016
The Connecticut Supreme Court reinstates Skakel’s murder conviction. The justices, reversing a lower court decision that had led to his release from prison, find that Skakel’s legal representation at trial was competent.
MAY 4, 2018
The Connecticut Supreme Court, acting on a defense request to review its 2016 decision, reverses itself and vacates the murder conviction. The justices rule, 4-3, that Skakel’s lawyer, Michael Sherman, should have presented evidence of an alibi. A retrial is possible.
JAN. 7, 2019
The U.S. Supreme Court denies the prosecutors’ attempts to revive Skakel’s conviction. Other than retrying Skakel, it was the prosecutors’ last chance to keep the case alive. They had argued that the U.S. Supreme Court should be able to address the decision by the state court because the decision was “grounded exclusively on federal constitutional law.”
The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court not to hear the prosecution’s appeal means the state court’s ruling stands.
OCT. 30, 2020
Skakel walks out of a Connecticut courthouse a free man after prosecutors announce that they do not have enough evidence to try him again.
His lawyer, Stephan Seeger, calls the decision the “right result.”
“Michael Skakel was innocent then; he’s innocent now,” Seeger says. “It’s no stretch of the imagination that they can’t prove the case within a reasonable doubt. It’s not simply a technicality that ends the case.”
Dorthy Moxley says that she still believes that Skakel killed her daughter but that she does not need for him to spend any more time in prison.
“I will never forget the day they found him guilty,” she says. “It gave me all the sense of justice I needed.”

Republican Susan Collins grapples with Trump presidency in bid to win fifth Senate term

Texto completo: During a heated debate recently hosted by WMTW in Portland, Maine, incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, refused to say whether she plans to vote for President Trump on Tuesday.
For Collins, Trump’s presidency has left her stuck in the middle with voters in Maine, a state that was nearly split on supporting the president in 2016 but is backing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden by double digits in 2020, polls indicate.
“I’m not getting into presidential politics,” Collins told moderator Steve Bottari during the Wednesday night debate.
But presidential politics will likely play a significant role in determining whether Collins, one of the few remaining centrists in Congress, will return to the Senate in January for a fifth term.
Polls show Democratic challenger Sara Gideon, Maine’s state House speaker, with a narrow but consistent lead.
More daunting for Collins are poll numbers showing that Biden, the former vice president, leads Trump among Maine voters by about 13 points.
Trump’s poor performance at the top of the ballot could drag down Collins, although her supporters note that she always performs better with voters than anyone at the top of the ticket.
In 2008, for example, Collins beat Democratic challenger Tom Allen by 33% even though President Barack Obama trounced Republican Sen. John McCain by a nearly 18-point margin.
But it could be difficult for Collins to win this time if Trump loses by double digits, polls suggest.
Collins, the only New England Republican left in Congress, is fighting to survive against a massive influx of outside spending on behalf of Gideon, who has held a consistent lead in all polls.
Gideon, 48, has outraised Collins by about $31 million and has outspent the Collins campaign by nearly $7 million in the most recent quarter, according to the Bangor Daily News. Overall, more than $170 million have been spent on the race.
Out-of-state liberal organizations have dumped money into the race, eager to unseat Collins since 2018, when she voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The groups are hoping to flip the Senate, currently in the hands of the Republican Party, and give the gavel to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.
The race is one of several toss-up Senate contests that will determine which party controls the majority in January.
Collins has sought to show voters she operates independently and is focused on serving constituents, not the party leaders.
“The focus of this race has always been on the people of Maine and what she has and can still do for them,” Collins's campaign spokeswoman Annie Clark told the Washington Examiner. “For two years, national Democrats have flooded the state with millions of dollars in false attack ads urging them to vote against their own self-interests solely to make Chuck Schumer the majority leader of the Senate.”
Gideon has worked to tie Collins to Trump, whom Mainers view poorly when it comes to handling the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare, and other top issues, polls show.
An October poll taken by Portland-based Pan Atlantic Research found nearly 60% of likely voters viewed Trump’s handling of the pandemic as “poor” or “very poor.” The same poll gave Biden a 10-point lead over Trump and found Gideon with a 7-point lead over Collins.
It’s a bigger lead for Gideon than internal GOP polls, which, according to one campaign aide, show the race is “brutally close.”
Gideon has criticized Congress, and Collins, for failing to pass a new round of federal aid that would include “hazard pay” for workers deemed essential during the pandemic, and she added that Collins has done little to criticize Trump for appearing to downplay the virus.
Collins has promoted her leading role in passing the Paycheck Protection Program, a nearly $700 billion loan program included in the last round of federal coronavirus aid, which has helped thousands of Maine's small businesses to survive economic lockdowns.
Collins criticized Gideon for shutting down the state legislature in March due to the pandemic. The United States Senate has mostly remained in session.
Collins, 67, is also touting her seniority. She’s in line for the top post on the Senate Appropriations Committee, one of the most powerful panels in Congress. The role would allow Collins to steer billions of federal dollars to Maine for infrastructure projects and other programs.
While Collins voted against confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, arguing that the confirmation process took place too close to the election, Democrats are linking Collins to the Senate GOP’s historic confirmation of hundreds of federal judges selected by the Trump administration. The conservative picks will potentially reshape the courts for decades to come.
“You hand-delivered Donald Trump’s and Mitch McConnell’s judiciary agenda,” Gideon said during Wednesday’s debate.
Collins pointed out that, in most cases, Democrats also voted for the judicial nominees.
Those in Collins’s corner believe she uniquely can pull off a victory even if Trump badly loses the state because she’s a centrist willing to buck the party at times.
“She is independent in many ways, and that leaves more of a pool of people who really have to think about how they are going to vote rather than automatically going in lockstep, like they would with other candidates,” Republican strategist Brent Littlefield, who served as a senior political adviser for former Maine Gov. Paul LePage, told the Washington Examiner.

Fueled by Cash, Health Care and Trump’s Woes, Democrats Aim for Senate Control

BOZEMAN, Mont. — Voters caught up in this state’s exceedingly close Senate race could be forgiven for believing Gov. Steve Bullock, the Democratic candidate, was sharing the ballot with Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader.
An incessant stream of Republican-funded advertisements depicts Bullock, a popular two-term governor, alongside Schumer and other leading Democrats such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Sen. Steve Daines, the Republican incumbent battling for political survival in the conservative-leaning state, regularly tries to tie his opponent to the national party, asserting that Bullock is Schumer’s “lap dog.”
“Steve Bullock in the Senate puts Chuck Schumer in charge,” the latest ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee said. “Think about that.”
Bullock doesn’t think much about it.
“I say it is all B.S.,” he said in an interview as snow descended upon Montana and shut down campaign appearances already curtailed by the coronavirus, which has hung over the election season and was surging anew in the Mountain West. “Montanans see through some of the stuff where they are trying to turn me into something they don’t recognize.”
But while the governor resented the ad’s implication, in one respect it was absolutely true: If Bullock is elected to the Senate, Schumer will almost certainly be in charge as the majority leader.
Here in Montana and in crucial battleground states across the country, Republicans are playing defense in a struggle for control of the Senate. Dragged by President Donald Trump’s struggles even in conservative states and confronting a phalanx of Democratic opponents who have raked in extraordinary sums of cash to challenge them, Republicans privately acknowledge that their majority is hanging by a thread.
The Montana race, described by strategists for both parties as a coin flip, is one of a handful of contests that will determine control of the Senate and the ability of the next president to pursue his agenda, fill a cabinet and win the judicial confirmations suddenly at the forefront of the nation’s political dialogue. Democrats have other narrow paths to Senate power, but a Bullock victory would essentially assure it and signal Democratic gains elsewhere.
As the race entered its final days, Republicans led by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, were being forced to shore up candidates in traditionally safe locations such as Alaska, Kansas and South Carolina. Democrats believe they are already on track to win Arizona and Colorado and are on the hunt for a half-dozen others starting with Iowa, Maine and North Carolina. Georgia is suddenly looming as a real opportunity for Democrats, with both of the state’s Republican senators at risk.
Democrats conceded they were likely to lose in Alabama, where Sen. Doug Jones is running for reelection after an upset victory in a special election in 2017, and are keeping a close watch on Michigan, where Sen. Gary Peters is facing John James, a Republican who was receiving a last-minute surge of outside money. But they were eyeing significant pickups elsewhere.
With Republicans holding the Senate majority by a margin of 53-47, a net gain of three seats would put Democrats in control should former Vice President Joe Biden win the presidency; four would be required if Trump is reelected.
Schumer called the battle for the Senate a “nail-biter,” but said the outlook for Democrats was far brighter than it was only a few months ago.
“If you would have told me in early January that we would have a good chance of winning the Senate, I would have said that is a real long shot,” he said in an interview. “Now we are in the ballpark because of the strategic decision to expand the seats that are in play.”
Republicans quietly agree that their prospects have dimmed considerably. One Senate Republican leader said privately that the party could end up with anywhere from 47 to 52 seats.
“It is a 50-50 proposition,” said McConnell, R-Ky., who appears to be safely headed toward reelection himself, about his chances for remaining majority leader. “We have a lot of exposure. It is a dogfight out there.”
Republicans are battling the brawl from a weakened position, given Trump’s woes and the record-crushing levels of money Democrats have raised for Senate races. Democratic challengers have flipped the usual formula on its head and outperformed Republican incumbents when it comes to contributions, providing ample resources for TV advertising even as the traditional campaign model has been upended by the pandemic.
Here in Montana, at least an estimated $120 million will be spent, while in Maine, more than $100 million is being poured into the showdown between Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican seeking a fifth term, and Sara Gideon, the Democratic speaker of the state House. The race in North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, is trying to hold on against Cal Cunningham, a Democrat, is set to be the most expensive Senate contest ever, with well over $200 million expended.
While Democratic candidates are still outspending Republicans in most of the marquee races during the final weeks, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with McConnell, has dumped more than $82 million into the effort since early October, helping close a money gap Republicans attribute to the success of online small-donor Democratic fundraising.
“We are being outspent dramatically, like so many other races around the country,” said Sen. John Cornyn, a three-term Texas Republican who finds himself in an unexpectedly tough match against M.J. Hegar, a Democrat and veteran. “We have been a little late to the dance and I think we are going to have to learn from the way Democrats raise money. It is no longer like going to a dinner and a cocktail party.”
The fact that Cornyn finds himself sweating is testament to how Democrats have opened multiple potential routes to a Senate majority while Republicans have failed to put their usual strongholds out of reach. Democrats have been unable to put away Collins, whom they saw as exceptionally vulnerable after her vote in 2018 to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. But Republicans now worry the voting system in Maine — in which voters’ second-choice candidate is counted if no candidate earns 50% — could cost her on Tuesday.
Democrats have focused relentlessly on health care in their campaigns, scorching Republicans for their yearslong drive to overturn the Affordable Care Act and its protections for preexisting conditions. The power of the message has been amplified by the pandemic and public anxiety about health costs. Republicans have pushed back with pledges to guarantee coverage but have not produced specifics on how they would do so.
The challenge for Democrats is that to win the Senate, they must prevail in states Trump carried in 2016 and is likely to carry again this year such as Iowa and Montana, though Biden victories in places like Arizona and North Carolina would make their task easier.
As Biden shows surprising momentum in Georgia, where two Republican Senate seats are up for grabs, Republicans have become increasingly concerned about the outlook for Sen. David Perdue, who drew widespread criticism for appearing to mock the name of Sen. Kamala Harris, his colleague and the Democratic vice presidential candidate. Polls show the Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff near the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff on Jan. 5, though the race for Perdue’s seat could spill into next year along with the fight for the one occupied by Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican who was appointed to the Senate last year. Such runoffs make it conceivable that control of the Senate will not be decided until January.
With Trump in real danger of losing, Senate Republicans are raising the alarm in more conservative states that a Republican Senate is needed to maintain a check on Democrats should Biden win the presidency and Democrats hold the House as expected. Republicans are pointing to Democratic support for calls to eliminate the filibuster and add seats to the Supreme Court as evidence of what Democrats plan.
“What happens if they have all the power?” a new National Republican Senatorial Committee ad airing against the Democratic candidate for Senate in Iowa, Theresa Greenfield, asks as ominous background music plays. “They will change the Senate rules to advance their liberal agenda.”
In Montana, a state awash in campaign advertising and negative political attacks, Republicans have sought to portray Bullock, whose job performance ratings have remained strong as he has managed the state response to the pandemic, as a politician who turned to the left during a failed presidential primary run.
“Steve Bullock is too liberal for Montana,” Daines said in a brief interview.
But Bullock proved in 2016 that he could draw the support of conservatives, narrowly winning reelection even as Trump easily carried the state. As a result, Republicans are trying to persuade voters that sending him to Washington would be more dangerous than putting him in charge of their state.
“They might like him as governor, but ultimately he is playing for the wrong team and would greenlight Democrats’ extreme agenda in the Senate,” said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for Republicans’ Senate campaign organization.
Bullock scoffs at the characterizations. His campaign advisers believe that a final campaign push focused on digital advertising targeted at the few remaining undecided voters and an intense outreach operation can bring a victory in a contest that both sides believe will be settled by a few thousand votes at most.
“The same person that Montanans elected twice governor and is now running for the Senate is going to be the same person when I show up in D.C.,” he said. “I’m not going to drink the water.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Facing a pandemic, record unemployment and unknown future costs for COVID-19 treatments, health insurers selling Affordable Care Act plans to individuals reacted by lowering rates in some areas and, overall, issuing only modest premium increases for 2021.
"What's been fascinating is that carriers in general are not projecting much impact from the pandemic for their 2021 premium rates," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
Although final rates have yet to be analyzed in all states, those who study the market say the premium increases they have seen to date will be in the low single digits -- and decreases are not uncommon.
That's good news for the more than 10 million Americans who purchase their own ACA health insurance through federal and state marketplaces. The federal market, which serves 36 states, opens for 2021 enrollment Nov. 1, with sign-up season ending Dec. 15. Some of the 14 states and the District of Columbia that operate their own markets have longer enrollment periods.
The flip side of flat or declining premiums is that some consumers who qualify for subsidies to help them purchase coverage may also see a reduction in that aid.
Despite the ongoing debate about the ACA -- compounded by a Supreme Court challenge brought by 20 Republican states and supported by the Trump administration -- enrollment and premium prices are not forecast to shift much.
"It's the third year in a row with premiums staying pretty stable," said Louise Norris, an insurance broker in Colorado who follows rates nationwide and writes about insurance trends. "We've seen modest rate changes and influx of new insurers."
That relative stability followed ups and downs, with the last big increases coming in 2018, partly in response to the Trump administration cutting some payments to insurers.
Those increases priced out some enrollees, particularly people who don't qualify for subsidies, which are tied both to income and the cost of premiums. ACA enrollment has fallen since its peak in 2016.
> Archiving note: A shorter version of this article appeared in print. Additional text, in parentheses below, is from the online article at stltoday.com.
(Charles Gaba, a web developer who has since late 2013 tracked enrollment data in the ACA on his ACASignups.net website, follows premium changes based on filings with state regulators. Each summer, insurers must file their proposed rates for the following year with states, which have varying oversight powers.
Gaba said the average requested increase next year nationwide is 2.1%. When he looked at 18 states for which regulators have approved insurers' requested rates, the percentage is lower, at 0.4%.
Another study, by Kaiser Family Foundation, of preliminary premiums filed this summer had similar findings: Premium changes in 2021 would be modest, only a few percentage points up or down.
IT'S STILL WORTH IT TO SHOP AROUND.
Actuaries and other experts say premiums vary by state or region -- even by insurer -- for a number of reasons, including the number and relative market power of insurers or hospitals in an area, which affects the ability of insurers to negotiate rates with providers.
Because subsidies are tied to each region's benchmark plan, and those premium costs may have gone down, subsidies also could decrease. (Benchmark plans are the second-lowest-priced silver plan in a region.)
Switching to the benchmark plan can help consumers maintain how much they spend in premiums.
Enrollees should update their financial information, particularly this year when many are affected by work reduction or job losses. "They might be eligible for a bigger" subsidy, said Myra Simon, executive director of commercial policies for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry lobbying group.
Enrollees can update their information online, or call their federal or state marketplace for assistance. Insurance brokers, too, can aid people in signing up for ACA plans. When shopping, consumers should check whether the doctors and hospitals they want to use are included in the plan's network.
Premiums are just one part of the equation. Consumers should also look closely at annual deductibles, because the trade-off of going with a lower-cost premium may well be higher annual deductibles that must be met before much of the coverage kicks in.
"We encourage people to consider all their options," said Simon.
WHAT'S BEHIND THE VARIATION.
Enrollees in some states next year will see premium decreases, according to Gaba's website: Maine, for example, shows a 13% drop in weighted average premium prices, while Maryland's is down almost 12%. At the same time, Indiana's average is up 10%. And Kentucky is up 5%.
Both Maine and Maryland attribute the decrease to state programs that provide reinsurance payments to health insurers to help offset high-cost medical claims.
In Florida, regulators say insurance premiums will rise about 3%, while the state exchange in California is reporting just over a half-percent increase, its lowest average increase since opening in 2014. Officials in California cite factors that include an influx of healthier enrollees and a reduction in fees that insurers pay.
Other factors affecting rates include how much state regulators step in to alter initial rate filings, along with a provision of the ACA that requires insurers to spend at least 80% of revenue on direct medical care. If insurers don't meet that standard, they must issue rebates to policyholders. Many insurers were already on the hook to return money in 2020 for previous years.
Most insurers did not cite additional COVID treatment or testing costs as factors in their requested rate increase, Gaba said. Even those that did, however, mainly found them unnecessary because of reduced expenditures resulting from patients delaying elective care during the spring and summer.
Indeed, many insurers in the second quarter posted record profits.
"Some of them thought, 'We're going to make more than we thought this year in profits, so let's not be aggressive with pricing next year,'" said Donna Novak, a member of the American Academy of Actuaries' Individual and Small Group Markets Committee.
A smaller factor may be the repeal of a fee paid by insurers on premiums. Part of the ACA, the fee was permanently eliminated by the Trump administration effective for 2021.
YOUR CHOICE OF INSURERS MAY HAVE WIDENED.
More insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, either stepped back into that individual market or expanded into new counties.
"Insurers are seeing a profit or potential for it," said John Dodd, an insurance broker in Columbus and past president of the Ohio Association of Health Underwriters.
Rates are down in general across his state for ACA plans, he said, and he expects agents to be busier than ever, simply because there are more plan offerings and choices to make and people want help.
Insurers, he said, like the way the ACA is working.
"People on TV who say it's not working, they don't know what they're talking about," said Dodd. "It's working well [for insurers] and every year it gets better."
NEW STUFF IN SOME STATES, INCLUDING A PUBLIC OPTION.
Residents of New Jersey and Pennsylvania will buy coverage from new state-based marketplaces for 2021, after those states pulled out of the federal healthcare.gov, which now covers 36 states.
Lawmakers in those states said running their own marketplaces gives them more control and may save them money over time.
In 19 Washington state counties, insurers are offering "public option plans," which have all the standard benefits, including lower deductibles, and must meet additional quality standards.
As envisioned, the public option plans aimed to be less expensive, with the legislation tying payment rates to Medicare. Insurers offering a public option must stick to an aggregate cap of paying doctors, hospitals and other medical providers an average of 160% of what Medicare would pay for the same services.
When the premium rates came in, however, the five insurers offering the plans had varying prices. Not all parts of the state have the option, but where they do, two of the public option insurers have premiums that are either lower than other plans in the area or are the lowest-cost plan the insurer offers.
But three are more expensive.
The state's marketplace staff said the higher prices may reflect a number of things, from difficulty getting the program started during COVID-19 to a lack of incentives to get providers to participate.
It could also just be normal first-year jitters.
"It's Year One. As with any market entry strategy, people are pretty conservative," said Michael Marchand, chief marketing officer of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange.

Texto completo: Facing a pandemic, record unemployment and unknown future costs for COVID-19 treatments, health insurers selling Affordable Care Act plans to individuals reacted by lowering rates in some areas and, overall, issuing only modest premium increases for 2021.
"What's been fascinating is that carriers in general are not projecting much impact from the pandemic for their 2021 premium rates," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
Although final rates have yet to be analyzed in all states, those who study the market say the premium increases they have seen to date will be in the low single digits - and decreases are not uncommon.
That's good news for the more than 10 million Americans who buy their own ACA health insurance through federal and state marketplaces. The federal market, which serves 36 states, opens for 2021 enrollment on Sunday, with sign-up season ending Dec. 15. Some of the 14 states and the District of Columbia that operate their own markets have longer enrollment periods.
The flip side of flat or declining premiums is that some consumers who qualify for subsidies to help them purchase coverage may also see a reduction in that aid.
Here are a few things to know about 2021 coverage:
It might cost about the same this year - or less
Despite the ongoing debate about the ACA - compounded by a Supreme Court challenge brought by 20 Republican states and supported by the Trump administration - enrollment and premium prices are not forecast to shift much.
"It's the third year in a row with premiums staying pretty stable," said Louise Norris, an insurance broker in Colorado who follows rates nationwide and writes about insurance trends. "We've seen modest rate changes and an influx of new insurers."
That relative stability followed ups and downs, with the last big increases coming in 2018, partly in response to the Trump administration cutting some payments to insurers.
Those increases priced out some enrollees, particularly people who don't qualify for subsidies, which are tied both to income and the cost of premiums. ACA enrollment has fallen since its peak in 2016.
Charles Gaba, a web developer who has since late 2013 tracked enrollment data in the ACA on his ACASignups.net website, follows premium changes based on filings with state regulators. Each summer, insurers must file their proposed rates for the following year with states, which have varying oversight powers.
Gaba said the average requested increase next year nationwide is 2.1%. When he looked at 18 states for which regulators have approved insurers' requested rates, the percentage is lower, at 0.4%.
Another study, by KFF, of preliminary premiums filed this summer had similar findings: Premium changes in 2021 would be modest, only a few percentage points up or down. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)
It's still worth it to shop around
Actuaries and other experts say premiums vary by state or region - even by insurer - for a number of reasons, including the number and relative market power of insurers or hospitals in an area, which affects the ability of insurers to negotiate rates with providers.
Because subsidies are tied to each region's benchmark plan, and those premium costs may have gone down, subsidies also could decrease. (Benchmark plans are the second-lowest-priced silver plan in a region.)
Switching to the benchmark plan can help consumers maintain how much they spend in premiums.
Enrollees should update their financial information, particularly this year when many are affected by work reduction or job losses. "They might be eligible for a bigger" subsidy, said Myra Simon, executive director of commercial policies for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry lobbying group.
Enrollees can update their information online, or call their federal or state marketplace for assistance. Insurance brokers, too, can aid people in signing up for ACA plans. When shopping, consumers should check whether the doctors and hospitals they want to use are included in the plan's network.
Premiums are just one part of the equation. Consumers should also look closely at annual deductibles, because the trade-off of going with a lower-cost premium may well be higher annual deductibles that must be met before much of the coverage kicks in.
"We encourage people to consider all their options," said Simon.
What's behind the variation
Enrollees in some states next year will see premium decreases, according to Gaba's website: Maine, for example, shows a 13% drop in weighted average premium prices, while Maryland's is down almost 12%. At the same time, Indiana's average is up 10%. And Kentucky is up 5%.
Both Maine and Maryland attribute the decrease to state programs that provide reinsurance payments to health insurers to help offset high-cost medical claims.
In Florida, regulators say insurance premiums will rise about 3%, while the state exchange in California is reporting just over a half-percent increase, its lowest average increase since opening in 2014. Officials in California cite factors that include an influx of healthier enrollees and a reduction in fees that insurers pay.
Most insurers did not cite additional COVID treatment or testing costs as factors in their requested rate increase, Gaba said. Even those that did, however, mainly found them unnecessary because of reduced expenditures resulting from patients delaying elective care during the spring and summer.
Indeed, many insurers in the second quarter posted record profits.
A smaller factor may be the repeal of a fee paid by insurers on premiums. Part of the ACA, the fee was permanently eliminated by the Trump administration effective for 2021.

The Ocean-Based Climate Solutions Act is a win for Maine

Kathleen Meil of Camden is the director of policy and partnerships for Maine Conservation Voters/Maine Conservation Alliance.
From coast to coast, our nation has been rocked by disasters this year -- and not just from the pandemic. Record-breaking hurricanes, unprecedented wildfires, and severe droughts have made too many Americans painfully aware of how vulnerable our health, safety, and economy are to climate change.
Mainers know those vulnerabilities well -- from extreme heat to surging high tides. We know we're facing a climate emergency here in Maine and across the globe. We must act now, and we need to use every tool at our disposal. One source of solutions has been largely overlooked, even though it covers more than 70 percent of the planet: our ocean.
Like so many Mainers, the ocean shapes my days. My coastal community teems with sailors and hardy open-water swimmers; my children have grown up clamoring on rocks and jumping off seawalls at high tide. The ocean is an ever-changing constant that provides jobs and recreation, backdrop and main course for rites of passage and random moments. The ocean matters here.
Still, you don't have to live in a coastal community to care about the ocean -- or to notice that it's in trouble. Scientists have extensively documented the toll climate change is taking on the ocean, which has become hotter, more acidic, and less hospitable to fish and marine wildlife as we've pumped heat and carbon into the atmosphere. Climate and fisheries research reveals that surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have increased faster than 99 percent of the global ocean over the last 15 years. These changes have harmed, and will continue to harm, our coastal economies and communities.
But the ocean is not just a victim of climate change. It's also a powerful source of solutions, with the potential to provide one-fifth of the annual cuts of greenhouse gas emissions needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C.
The new Ocean-Based Climate Solutions Act encourages our nation to once more be a global leader in novel and critical approaches to climate change solutions. It was introduced on Oct. 20 by Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who hails from the land-locked state of Arizona, and other members of the Natural Resources Committee. Whether the ocean feels personal or not, its health is essential to all of us.
Building on recent recommendations from the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and the growing recognition by scientists, policy experts and ocean advocates, the bill makes the ocean an integral part of the climate solution. Specifically, it promotes coastal resiliency and adaptation to protect our coasts from the climate impacts we can't avoid. In addition to supporting grants and research, it authorizes $3 billion to support shovel-ready coastal restoration projects with priority to projects that help stimulate the economy, provide jobs for workers affected by COVID-19, and assist communities of color, as well as low-income, tribal and rural communities. With over 3,000 miles of coastline in Maine, this kind of investment in coastal restoration and resilience is a win-win-win for our economy, our frontline communities, and our environment.
The ocean nourishes us in so many ways, and it could be restored in as little as 30 years if we mitigate major pressures like climate change. The Ocean-Based Climate Solutions Act will help us harness the ocean's capacity to address the climate crisis while we protect and restore it. That's something coastal and inland residents across the political spectrum can agree on.
Rep. Chellie Pingree has been a fierce advocate for our oceans, working tirelessly to protect our coastal and marine ecosystems, and just signed on to co-sponsor this important legislation. Rep. Jared Golden consistently supports climate action. The Ocean-Based Climate Solutions Act presents another opportunity for Maine's representatives to be leaders on our nation's efforts to advance ocean climate action now.

Texto completo: The race for the presidency hinges on about a dozen swing states that could provide either Republican President Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden a path to victory.
The dozens of polls covering the swing states generally show Biden ahead in most. But many are close enough to say the race is still in flux as Election Day approaches.
Biden is clearly ahead in overall national polls and is expected to win the majority of votes. But as Americans know, it's not taking the overall vote that matters, but the electoral votes that come with winning individual states.
Here's a look at the swing states, polls and electoral combinations:
Pennsylvania: They call it the Keystone State and, like in 2016, it will play a key role in either candidate's chances. Trump more so.
Heading into the final weekend of the campaign, Biden led in six of the eight most recent polls, according to Real Clear Politics - including a 5-point advantage in a Fox News poll. All surveys combined, Biden has roughly a 3.5-percentage-point lead.
But there are some important points to make about this swing state.
Because of pandemic-driven increase in absentee ballots, Pennsylvania is one that could show Trump ahead on election night, only to have Biden surge to the lead once mailed ballots are counted.
FiveThirtyEight.com has posited that Trump could lead Pennsylvania by as much as 16 points on election night, but the margin shifts 21 points in Biden's favor once all votes are tallied - giving Biden a narrow win here.
Plus, Pennsylvania is one of the last states to begin counting absentee ballots. Whereas some states will have the bulk of their absentee ballots tabulated on Election Day or the day after, it could take days in the Keystone State.
Finally, forecasters have noted that Pennsylvania has been "under-polled," making it tougher to really see a consensus hardening. 
Florida: It has 29 electoral votes and Trump's win here in 2016 was essential to his victory. Right now, the dozen or so polls show Biden with a razor-thin margin - 1.2 points on average, according to Real Clear Politics.
FiveThirtyEight.com currently projects a 51-49 win for Biden.
Note, Trump came from behind to win here last time around. He almost must have Florida again to reach the 270 electoral votes to win the election.
Side note: Republicans have registered more new voters than Democrats here since 2016.
Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio: Trump's wins in Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016 were viewed as his most surprising and key to crumbling the Democrats' "Blue Wall" of Midwest states.
This time, however, polls show Trump trailing in each by wider margins than in '16.
In Wisconsin, Biden is ahead by an average of about 6 points - though forecasters note this state is known as hard to poll. That's why you see such fluctuations as the Susquehanna survey saying the race is tied to the ABC News/Washington Post survey saying Biden by 17.
Like it's neighbor, Michigan shows Biden with an average 6-point lead. But unlike Wisconsin, Michigan polls don't vary widely; it's been much more consistent.
Ohio is in a dead heat. Like with Florida, Trump won here in '16 and almost has to have it again to win this time.
Georgia, North Carolina: These traditionally have voted Republican but are viewed now as toss-up states. Both are considered dead heats. The forecasts have changed more for Georgia than any other state. In September, it was considered solidly Trump.
Iowa, Minnesota: Though not as crucial as Wisconsin and Michigan, these states will play a role.
The Iowa poll average shows Biden with a 1-point lead. But some forecasters still believe the state will back Trump again.
Biden has a 5-point lead in Minnesota, a margin that's grown slightly and held since September.
Nevada, Arizona, Texas: In the West and Southwest, Democrats are hoping a younger and more Latino electorate can turn the election in their favor.
Nevada has become a more reliable Democratic supporter; currently, Biden leads it by an average of 4 points.
Texas hasn't been traditionally competitive, but Trump's lead there is just over 2 points.
Arizona, like Georgia, has seen a shift toward Biden since summer. Trump won Arizona by 4 in 2016; currently, it's a dead heat.
The split-vote states: Nebraska and Maine aren't winner-take-all states. Rather, each congressional district has an electoral vote. And if it comes down to it, the 2nd Congressional District of Maine and 2nd C.D. of Nebraska could cast deciding votes. Trump won both in '16; both fall into the tossup categor

Texto completo: The adult education and community centers, as well as CareerCenters will provide help.
JAY — Representatives from state and local education centers are ready to help the 67 people who lost their jobs this week at the Androscoggin Mill.
The 110 people who previously lost their jobs at the mill in July and September are already being helped by the Maine Department of Labor, according to department spokeswoman Jessica Picard.
Department representatives have scheduled Rapid Response services for the newest wave of dislocated workers.
Rapid Response is a program to assist affected workers who have lost their jobs due to downsizing or closures, according to the Maine CareerCenter website.
The Rapid Response Team provides laid-off workers with information on what services are available, showing them how to apply for unemployment insurance, and letting them know what other options there are such as training, job search assistance, and health insurance, Picard said.
The department “always include and invite the local adult education center to participate in Rapid Response sessions,” she wrote.
“Our Rapid Response team connects with any company where there have been layoffs to offer informational sessions and services,” Picard wrote in an email Thursday. “These sessions with affected workers, which has been expanded to also include virtual sessions during the pandemic, provide information and answer questions on unemployment insurance, CareerCenter resources and training options available, and health care information.”
CareerCenter services are open to everyone, and information on what types of reemployment services and workshops CareerCenters provide can be found online at mainecareercenter.gov.
CareerCenters also offer 1-on-1 services to look at what someone’s career goals or next steps may be, and how to help them get there. Whether someone is eligible for unemployment insurance benefits ultimately depends on each individual’s earnings and circumstances. Eligibility cannot be determined until they apply for benefits, according to Picard.
Robyn Raymond, director of Spruce Mountain Adult and Community Education in Livermore Falls, and Nancy Allen, director of Franklin County Adult and Community Education in Farmington, say they have a lot of educational options available for dislocated workers and anyone else who loses a job.
Classes include teaching people how to put together resumes, cover letters, career exploration, college transition, technology and workforce training.
Raymond said among the course offerings at the Spruce Mountain center are IT professional classes and certified medical assistant, culinary, Occupational Safety and Health Administration certification and paralegal classes. A list of courses can be found at rsu73.maineadulted.org/.
The Spruce Mountain center is in the RSU 73 Central Office building at 9 Cedar St. in Livermore Falls. The telephone number is 207-897-6406. Raymond’s email is RRaymond@rsu73.com.
“We have a full line of courses,” Allen said. “What may be of significant help is our Community Support days. Every Thursday we are offering no cost classes in resume writing, career exploration, cover letter writing, and all sorts of technology.”
Other courses include certified nursing assistant, medical technician and emergency medical technician. The website is rsd9.maineadulted.org.
The center is at 129 Seamon Road, Suite 1A, in Farmington at Mt. Blue Campus. The telephone number is 207-778-3406. Allen’s email is nallen@mtbluersd.org.

Texto completo: The inpatient caseload is spread over an unusually wide number of hospitals, while Portland’s are remarkably quiet.
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Maine ticked up in the past week, with a geographic pattern that parallels the wider distribution in new cases as the state experiences a record surge of positive tests.
Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 inpatient admissions have been concentrated at major hospitals in Maine’s three southernmost counties. But this week’s increases were primarily at hospitals in other parts of the state, with an unprecedented number of small hospitals having inpatients at the same time.
The total number of COVID-19 inpatients statewide is still low compared to other states. The count stood at 17 on Friday, according to Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, well below the peak of 60 on May 26. But the agency Friday reported a record-breaking 103 new cases of the disease, which is spreading at twice the rate of a month ago.
“It’s a strong warning for all of us,” said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, the state’s largest hospital network and parent of Maine Medical Center. “I would not say we are in a surge, but that we have all the ingredients for a surge and it’s baking.”
“We knew we would probably have a surge in the winter,” she added, “but I am concerned that all the ingredients are there and it’s still fall.”
In a given week during the crisis, one or two of Maine’s smaller hospitals might have reported having a pandemic inpatient or two for a few days but would go weeks or even months without one. But this week many of these smaller hospitals had inpatients, including Franklin Memorial in Farmington, Waldo General in Belfast, York Hospital, Bridgton Hospital and A.R. Gould in Presque Isle.
PenBay Medical Center in Rockport and Rumford Hospital both had a higher average daily inpatient load than Maine Med this week, reporting 2 and 1.3 cases, respectively. In PenBay’s case, this week’s total of nightly COVID-19 inpatient counts — 14 — represented two-thirds of the hospital’s total tally for the entire pandemic.
York Hospital had its busiest week since late August with 1.1 patients a day. Erich Fogg, who oversees COVID-19 testing at the hospital and its drive-thru rapid testing locate on Route 1, said it has also seen a steady rise in the proportion of tests coming back positive, with Thursday’s total count of 80 being the largest daily figure yet. “We’re heading into a concerning trend line,” he said.
Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor had its busiest week since July, averaging 1.7 COVID-19 inpatients a day for the period, while MaineGeneral in Augusta had 2.4 a day, its busiest week since the late May surge.
By contrast, Portland’s hospitals were both unusually quiet for the week ending Thursday, with Maine Med reporting an average of only 0.9 patients per day, down from the low-to-mid 30s per day during the disease’s peak surges in early April and late May. Mercy Hospital hasn’t had a COVID-19 inpatient since Sept. 28.
The largest hospital in York County, Southern Maine Health Care Medical Center, also had 0.9 patients per day, while Mid Coast in Brunswick last had a COVID-19 inpatient on Oct. 2.
Androscoggin County’s major hospitals were quiet. Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston had 0.9 inpatients a day, less than half its burden in late September and the first half of October. Lewiston’s other hospital, St. Mary’s, had no COVID-19 inpatients at all for the period, whereas it had at least one every day from Sept. 26 to Oct. 19.
“The window is getting narrower to get this under control, and it’s all in our hands,” said Mills, a former director of the Maine CDC and younger sister of Gov. Janet Mills. “It’s the ‘three W’s’: Watch your distance, wear a mask, and wash your hands.”
Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator in that they typically occur one to three weeks after a person is exposed to the disease, but unlike other metrics, it is not dependent on who and how many people were tested. They can end three ways: recovery, death or transfer to another facility.
The Press Herald’s survey is for the seven days ending Oct. 29. It compiles data received directly from the hospitals and hospital networks. The data do not include outpatients or inpatients who were suspected of having the virus but never tested. The survey includes most of the state’s hospitals and accounts for the vast majority of the statewide hospitalizations reported each week by the Maine CDC.

Texto completo: The adult education and community centers, as well as CareerCenters will provide help.
JAY — Representatives from state and local education centers are ready to help the 67 people who lost their jobs this week at the Androscoggin Mill.
The 110 people who previously lost their jobs at the mill in July and September are already being helped by the Maine Department of Labor, according to department spokeswoman Jessica Picard.
Department representatives have scheduled Rapid Response services for the newest wave of dislocated workers.
Rapid Response is a program to assist affected workers who have lost their jobs due to downsizing or closures, according to the Maine CareerCenter website.
The Rapid Response Team provides laid-off workers with information on what services are available, showing them how to apply for unemployment insurance, and letting them know what other options there are such as training, job search assistance, and health insurance, Picard said.
The department “always include and invite the local adult education center to participate in Rapid Response sessions,” she wrote.
“Our Rapid Response team connects with any company where there have been layoffs to offer informational sessions and services,” Picard wrote in an email Thursday. “These sessions with affected workers, which has been expanded to also include virtual sessions during the pandemic, provide information and answer questions on unemployment insurance, CareerCenter resources and training options available, and health care information.”
CareerCenter services are open to everyone, and information on what types of reemployment services and workshops CareerCenters provide can be found online at mainecareercenter.gov.
CareerCenters also offer 1-on-1 services to look at what someone’s career goals or next steps may be, and how to help them get there. Whether someone is eligible for unemployment insurance benefits ultimately depends on each individual’s earnings and circumstances. Eligibility cannot be determined until they apply for benefits, according to Picard.
Robyn Raymond, director of Spruce Mountain Adult and Community Education in Livermore Falls, and Nancy Allen, director of Franklin County Adult and Community Education in Farmington, say they have a lot of educational options available for dislocated workers and anyone else who loses a job.
Classes include teaching people how to put together resumes, cover letters, career exploration, college transition, technology and workforce training.
Raymond said among the course offerings at the Spruce Mountain center are IT professional classes and certified medical assistant, culinary, Occupational Safety and Health Administration certification and paralegal classes. A list of courses can be found at rsu73.maineadulted.org/.
The Spruce Mountain center is in the RSU 73 Central Office building at 9 Cedar St. in Livermore Falls. The telephone number is 207-897-6406. Raymond’s email is RRaymond@rsu73.com.
“We have a full line of courses,” Allen said. “What may be of significant help is our Community Support days. Every Thursday we are offering no cost classes in resume writing, career exploration, cover letter writing, and all sorts of technology.”
Other courses include certified nursing assistant, medical technician and emergency medical technician. The website is rsd9.maineadulted.org.
The center is at 129 Seamon Road, Suite 1A, in Farmington at Mt. Blue Campus. The telephone number is 207-778-3406. Allen’s email is nallen@mtbluersd.org.

Texto completo: Students at the Sidney school for the arts perform for family and friends despite the cold weather Friday morning during a walk-through recital in what some call a return to normalcy.
Family and friends of students at the Maine Arts Academy in Sidney braved cold temperatures Friday morning for an outdoor, walk-through recital that gave students the opportunity to display their talents to an in-person, socially distanced audience.
Attendees looped around the campus, located on Messalonskee Lake, and stopped at eight locations to watch students perform monologues, sing, dance and play musical instruments.
The recital ended with an art show that included pieces made by the visual arts students.
Head of School Heather King said the idea to have a hybrid-style recital has been part of the ongoing effort to be creative during the coronavirus pandemic.
“This has really helped us be creative,” King said. “We’ve really just had to think outside the box. So we were just brainstorming, and I think I was like, ‘We could have an outdoor recital because we had an outdoor graduation.’ Our graduation was a drive-thru format, so we thought, since we already did it for graduation, we could do this as well.”
Attendees, as well as dancers, singers and some students who played instruments, wore protective masks during the event.
Students who performed monologues and those who played brass or wind instruments removed their masks during their performances.
Hand sanitizer and extra masks were available at several stops along the recital route.
After the final dance performance, attendees walked through a gallery in groups of 10 to view the art.
“We really wanted to make sure that everybody was safe,” King said.
King emphasized her excitement to be able to have the recital, especially with the uncertainty the pandemic has brought.
“I’m thrilled we were able to do this. Especially as a teenager, this is all such a hard time, and I feel like they can feel isolated,” King said. “I’m so happy especially because when we have these recitals, we can really see the purpose of why we have this school.”
Now in its fifth year, Maine Arts Academy is a public charter school that serves 250 students from almost 80 Maine communties.
With the coronavirus pandemic, Maine Arts Academy opted for a hybrid-learning model, where students alternate days of in-person and remote learning. Some students have opted for fully remote learning.
King, who has been with the school since its inception, said the school made a seamless transition to remote learning in the spring, which made planning for the fall much easier. Spring performances were held via Zoom, so having an in-person element this fall felt more normal.
While one cohort is on campus, the other livestreams into class. In-person class sizes are limited to 10 students. The school is responsible for transporting about 120 students to school each day, using five buses and two vans.
King said she hoped to organize another walk-thru style recital later this year.
Many students who participated in Friday’s recital noted how grateful they were to perform this year after having the spring semester moved online.
“This feels really good, especially since I’m a senior,” said Shelby Lyons, 17, who performed in the advanced dance segment of the show. “It’s really nice to be able to perform and actually do things my senior year.”
Senior piano player Dawud Bloomstein, 17, who performed a rendition of Beethoven’s “Pathétique” sonata, agreed with Lyons.
“It’s really, really amazing,” Bloomstein said. “I’ve been working at the piano for so long, so it’s really nice to be able to play my final year, and maybe an inspiration for any incoming students. It’s just really great.”
Kloe McEachirn, 16, who plays the trombone, said Friday’s event gave students a sense of normalcy despite the hybrid format.
“Last year, we didn’t get a chance to do our end of the year performances,” McEachirn said. “So this really helped everyone feel more normal even with the circumstances.”
Musical theater students Zion Lawrence and Dorothy Anne Giroux-Pare agreed with McEachirn.
“We’re really happy we were able to perform,” said Giroux-Pare, 17. “Because we’ve honestly been struggling with the beginning of this year and the end of last year, so to be able to show everyone what we’ve been working on is great.”
“It shows everyone that we’re still here, we’re still performing,” Lawrence, 15, added.

Texto completo: The inpatient caseload is spread over an unusually wide number of hospitals, while Portland’s are remarkably quiet.
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Maine ticked up in the past week, with a geographic pattern that parallels the wider distribution in new cases as the state experiences a record surge of positive tests.
Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 inpatient admissions have been concentrated at major hospitals in Maine’s three southernmost counties. But this week’s increases were primarily at hospitals in other parts of the state, with an unprecedented number of small hospitals having inpatients at the same time.
The total number of COVID-19 inpatients statewide is still low compared to other states. The count stood at 17 on Friday, according to Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, well below the peak of 60 on May 26. But the agency Friday reported a record-breaking 103 new cases of the disease, which is spreading at twice the rate of a month ago.
“It’s a strong warning for all of us,” said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, the state’s largest hospital network and parent of Maine Medical Center. “I would not say we are in a surge, but that we have all the ingredients for a surge and it’s baking.”
“We knew we would probably have a surge in the winter,” she added, “but I am concerned that all the ingredients are there and it’s still fall.”
In a given week during the crisis, one or two of Maine’s smaller hospitals might have reported having a pandemic inpatient or two for a few days but would go weeks or even months without one. But this week many of these smaller hospitals had inpatients, including Franklin Memorial in Farmington, Waldo General in Belfast, York Hospital, Bridgton Hospital and A.R. Gould in Presque Isle.
PenBay Medical Center in Rockport and Rumford Hospital both had a higher average daily inpatient load than Maine Med this week, reporting 2 and 1.3 cases, respectively. In PenBay’s case, this week’s total of nightly COVID-19 inpatient counts — 14 — represented two-thirds of the hospital’s total tally for the entire pandemic.
York Hospital had its busiest week since late August with 1.1 patients a day. Erich Fogg, who oversees COVID-19 testing at the hospital and its drive-thru rapid testing locate on Route 1, said it has also seen a steady rise in the proportion of tests coming back positive, with Thursday’s total count of 80 being the largest daily figure yet. “We’re heading into a concerning trend line,” he said.
Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor had its busiest week since July, averaging 1.7 COVID-19 inpatients a day for the period, while MaineGeneral in Augusta had 2.4 a day, its busiest week since the late May surge.
By contrast, Portland’s hospitals were both unusually quiet for the week ending Thursday, with Maine Med reporting an average of only 0.9 patients per day, down from the low-to-mid 30s per day during the disease’s peak surges in early April and late May. Mercy Hospital hasn’t had a COVID-19 inpatient since Sept. 28.
The largest hospital in York County, Southern Maine Health Care Medical Center, also had 0.9 patients per day, while Mid Coast in Brunswick last had a COVID-19 inpatient on Oct. 2.
Androscoggin County’s major hospitals were quiet. Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston had 0.9 inpatients a day, less than half its burden in late September and the first half of October. Lewiston’s other hospital, St. Mary’s, had no COVID-19 inpatients at all for the period, whereas it had at least one every day from Sept. 26 to Oct. 19.
“The window is getting narrower to get this under control, and it’s all in our hands,” said Mills, a former director of the Maine CDC and younger sister of Gov. Janet Mills. “It’s the ‘three W’s’: Watch your distance, wear a mask, and wash your hands.”
Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator in that they typically occur one to three weeks after a person is exposed to the disease, but unlike other metrics, it is not dependent on who and how many people were tested. They can end three ways: recovery, death or transfer to another facility.
The Press Herald’s survey is for the seven days ending Oct. 29. It compiles data received directly from the hospitals and hospital networks. The data do not include outpatients or inpatients who were suspected of having the virus but never tested. The survey includes most of the state’s hospitals and accounts for the vast majority of the statewide hospitalizations reported each week by the Maine CDC.

Texto completo: Forty-four of the new cases are in Cumberland County, where outbreaks have been connected to Pat's Pizza in Portland and the Maine Correctional Center in Windham.
Maine shattered its daily record for COVID-19 cases Friday, with 103 new infections reported as the virus continues to spread widely across the state.
Gov. Janet Mills said she is considering a range of steps in response to the surge, such as delaying the scheduled opening of bars on Monday and reducing the maximum size of indoor gatherings.
Also on Friday, as a result of worsening trends, three counties — Waldo, Somerset and Washington — were designated “yellow” by the Maine Department of Education, which means school sports and extracurricular activities will be curtailed.
Forty-four of the new cases are in Cumberland County, 11 in Somerset County and nine cases each in York County and Kennebec County. There were no additional deaths.
Cumberland County has seen cases jump from 16 on Wednesday to 22 on Thursday and 44 on Friday.
Recent Cumberland County outbreaks include 18 cases at Pat’s Pizza in the Old Port in Portland, and 18 cases at the Maine Correctional Center in Windham.
Cases keep climbing in Maine after a long period of relatively stable, low case counts. There were 80 new cases on Thursday and 76 on Wednesday.
The seven-day daily average of new cases stood at 67.9 on Friday, compared to 37 a week ago and 30.4 a month ago.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said in a tweet Friday: “The surge is here. Take action now. For your sake, and for the sake of your family and community, wear a mask and stay apart. This is serious.”
Testing has increased substantially over the past week, Shah said. The seven-day daily average of COVID-19 tests performed was 519 tests per 100,000 population Friday, a jump of 15% to 25% compared to the previous month. Testing has fluctuated between about 400 tests per 100,000 to 450 tests per 100,000, according to the Maine CDC.
But the percentage of tests that have been returned as positive has also increased, with the seven-day daily average going from 0.49% two weeks ago to 0.83% ON Friday.
The national average is about 7%, so Maine is doing much better than the national average, but the increase in the positivity rate is a worrisome trend, Shah said. The higher the positivity rate, the harder it is for public health workers to tamp down on outbreaks and prevent exponential growth of the virus.
Robert Long, Maine CDC spokesman, said in an email that while testing volume is robust, “the increase in cases appears most likely to result from community transmission.”
“The continued rise in the seven-day positivity rate offers another indication that the increase in cases derives more from community transmission than additional testing,” Long said.
The steady rise in case counts comes a day after Maine announced a partnership with Walgreens, which will stock free rapid antigen tests that can produce results within 15 minutes.
The rapid tests are expected to be in 65 Walgreens locations throughout Maine as a drive-thru service starting sometime in November. A doctor’s note is not needed for the rapid tests, and anyone who thinks they need a test can get one under Maine’s standing order for COVID-19 tests.
Patients will “self-swab” their nasal cavity under the supervision of a pharmacy employee. The nasal swabs are less invasive than the deep nasal swab tests in use by what up until now has been the more common COVID-19 PCR molecular tests, which typically return results within 24 to 48 hours in Maine.
Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, said in a conference call with reporters on Friday that Maine’s partnership with Walgreens is a “great idea” because the state can “leverage the (retail) footprint of Walgreens to make testing more accessible.”
Mina has been advocating for the expansion of rapid testing as a key tool to help suppress the virus. Maine will receive 400,000 of the rapid antigen tests by the end of the year, with more expected for 2021. The tests will help people working in essential jobs — such as health care, police, fire, paramedics and teachers — to return to work if they have been exposed to COVID-19 but test negative and do not show symptoms.
“We need to be thinking about every part of this as strategic,” Mina said. “Walgreens is really well situated to work with departments of health in Maine and other states to develop these strategies.”
Current hospitalizations were at 17 on Friday, with five people in intensive care.
The inpatient population has begun to inch higher and is more dispersed among the state’s hospitals.

Texto completo: Laurelai Winslow has shot five white-tailed deer since age 6. She will be among the Mainers taking part on opening day of the firearm season for deer on Saturday.
DAMARISCOTTA — Before the start of the spring hunting season, Laurelai Winslow had a heartfelt talk with her dad.
After years in which Tim Winslow followed his daughter on many of her successful hunts, she wanted to hunt alongside him — just as all hunting buddies do.
Tim Winslow shook his head and smiled when asked how he felt about his daughter’s earnest request, like a man at a loss for words. Laurelai Winslow, you see, is 10.
Laurelai already has built a hunting resume that would take many a lifetime to achieve. Since she started hunting at age 6, Laurelai has shot five white-tailed deer, two black bear, a caribou in Alaska, and nearly a dozen wild turkey.
The Winslows plan to be in the woods Saturday on opening day of Maine’s annual firearm season for white-tailed deer, which this year includes a record of 110,000 any-deer permit holders. Maine residents begin the hunt on Saturday; non-residents can start on Monday. The firearm season runs through Nov. 28, and is followed by the muzzleloader season, which ends Dec. 5.
Laurelai has two bonus deer tags, which means she could harvest up to three deer this fall. Do not bet against her: Two years ago, at age 8, she shot two deer using a bonus tag — all in one day.
Any hunter in Maine can harvest a buck with a general hunting license. But with a bonus tag from the deer-permit lottery — mostly allotted along the coast where state biologists want to thin the deer herd — a hunter can also harvest an additional deer for every bonus tag they win, although the bonus deer must be an antlerless deer (such as a doe or a buck without antlers).
Laurelai remembers that hunt in 2018 vividly, how she was “drawing on my pad, doodling,” in the hunting blind just after 6 a.m. when she looked up and saw “a big, big buck, with glowing antlers from the sun.”
She waited five minutes, until the eight-pointer turned broadside to make certain she had an ethical shot that would lead to a quick kill. Laurelai took that shot from 70 yards, without any instruction from her dad, and dropped the 185-pound buck.
Later that day when she stood in a family friend’s field in Warren, she saw a smaller “button buck” (an antlerless buck) and from 150 yards, Laurelai dropped the second deer without hesitation.
“On a hunt, she decides when to shoot,” said Tim Winslow, a Registered Maine Guide and carpenter. “And she decides when not to shoot. When she tells me she can make the shot, I know she can.”
Youth hunters in Maine can start at any age, as long as they are accompanied by an adult with a valid hunting license. Laurelai first harvested a white-tailed deer at age 6 — a 120-pound doe she shot from 70 yards.
“It was the biggest and prettiest thing in the world. I was so tiny I had never seen a deer that big up close,” said Laurelai, who hunted with her mother, Ali, that day. “(Dad) told me if the legs buck up, then you know you definitely hit it in the right place. I kept asking Mom after I shot: ‘Did I hit it? Did I hit it?’ And she kept saying, “Yup, you did.’”
Debbie Bocko, the Winslows former neighbor in Washington, met Laurelai four years ago when she asked Tim Winslow to teach her how to hunt. Laurelai ended up becoming a second mentor.
“I thought if this little 6-year-old can do it, I might be 64, but I can do it, too,” said Bocko, a homesteader who raises livestock on her 80-acre farm. “I’m part Native American and all about self-sufficiency and sustainability.
“She understands the hunt from beginning to end. It’s not about killing something. It’s about going out and harvesting an animal and providing food. She can field dress an animal better than I can.”
It is worth noting, Laurelai is the niece of the owner of the historic Libby Camps in the North Maine Woods, which date to 1880. But even Matt Libby, a Registered Maine Guide and float plane pilot, thinks his niece’s passion for hunting goes beyond her years.
“She is a rare breed, for sure,” Libby said. “My kids have already talked with her and apparently Kayla, my 12-year-old, is planning to buy me out; Parker, my 10-year-old, will be chief pilot; and Laurelai will be the head guide.”
At first glance, Laurelai Winslow appears to be a typical 10-year-old girl — and in many ways she is. She wears a big bow around her ponytail, has stuffed animals in her room and a chalkboard with artwork. She has colored her blond ponytail purple and blue to match that of her camo-clad Barbie, which Laurelai calls her “Hunting Barbie,” a doll she’s brought on hunts.
And Laurelai’s other deep passion is cheering with her grade school team. During a recent interview at her home, with the mounted grouse she shot behind her, Laurelai executed handstands, splits and backbends as she answered questions.
“If it’s a competition, then I like cheering better,” Laurelai said. “But if it’s just cheering practice, then hunting.”
Ali and Tim Winslow, both avid hunters, first started taking their daughter along on bird and deer hunts when she was 18-months-old, outfitting her with ear protection and carrying her in a pack. They brought her to the shooting range at age 4 — making short trips to make it fun, but also to constantly work on safe gun handling skills and accuracy. She took to it, and became a crack shot like her mother.
“My dad told me when they taught me, ‘You have to hit the target where you’re supposed to. And when you can, I’ll take you hunting,’” Laurelai said. “I really wanted to go. So I practiced a lot.”
The Winslows taught Laurelai shot placement: where to always shoot an animal to assure a quick kill. With a life-size plastic deer in their backyard, the Winslows still quiz Laurelai.
Bocko said her young friend’s love of hunting is obvious. One time when she was turkey hunting in a blind with Tim and Laurelai and Bocko’s scope stopped working, Laurelai passed her shotgun to Bocko and told her to use it instead. And one year when Bocko didn’t harvest a deer on her farm, Laurelai gave her half the venison from her deer, to thank Bocko for letting her hunt there.
“She’s very unselfish,” Bocko said. “She has the skill, and she’s good at it. But she’s got that sense of responsibility and knowledge. She’ll let deer go by rather than go out there and wound an animal. She’s a strong young woman. And she’s an inspiration for me, to see the next generation coming along.”

MS: Three Maine counties now designated ‘yellow’ in school reopening system

Texto completo: Somerset, Waldo and Washington counties are now designated as "yellow" in the state's school reopening advisory system.
Maine added two counties Friday to its list of those where it recommends schools offer hybrid instruction amid the state’s surge in coronavirus case numbers.
The Department of Education designated Somerset and Washington counties as “yellow,” meaning they have an elevated risk of COVID-19 spread.
Hybrid instruction is recommended as a way of limiting the number of people in schools and classrooms at any one time.
Waldo County, which received a “yellow” designation last week, remains “yellow.” The 13 other counties are green.
The changes come as Maine reported its highest single-day tally of coronavirus cases on Friday, with 103 new infections recorded around the state. Over the past 30 days, there have been 128 cases reported among students and staff in Maine schools.
The largest outbreak at a school so far has been at the Community Regional Charter School in Skowhegan and Cornville, which has reported 18 cases, though school officials said last week that everyone affected has recovered.
Most schools in Maine are already operating in hybrid models, but the transition has not been easy, and it is further complicated at schools that have had to shift between instructional models in response to cases.
“I’ve never had a problem that I felt so frustrated with,” Calais School Department Superintendent Ronald Jenkins said. “We’re getting bombarded in so many directions with what’s right and a different version of what’s right.
“It’s very difficult for us and I think that’s true of every superintendent in the state. It’s hard and quite frankly, they don’t teach you that in superintendent school.”
The Washington County district already opted to move to fully remote learning for its students Wednesday, so Jenkins said the state’s yellow designation won’t change things much. “We’re already following CDC guidance for the red designation,” he said.
Washington County is the site of a 27-person outbreak at Second Baptist Church, and the county’s two-week, population-adjusted case rate is four times higher than it was last week.
Waldo County continues to have Maine’s highest per-county positivity rate at 3%, and a new case rate of 17.4%. No outbreaks have been identified in Waldo County or Washington County schools at this time.
The state’s color advisory system, which is run by the Department of Education in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services and Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, is meant as a recommendation. Final decisions on instructional models are left up to individual school districts.
When the state launched the system in July, it originally said the advisories would be updated on a two-week cycle. However, the data is continually reviewed and Department of Education spokeswoman Kelli Deveaux said Friday the timeline is not fixed and flexibility is necessary to ensure timely updates to schools.
She said the significant increases in statewide cases necessitated Friday’s updates and that another update is anticipated next week.
While most of the state has been “green” since the start of the school year, meaning in-person instruction is allowed, most districts have opted for “yellow” models in order to adhere to the state’s required physical distance and safety guidelines. The DOE suggests that under a yellow model schools may want to take additional precautions such as suspending extracurricular activities and sports or limiting the number of people in buildings at one time.
Earlier this week the Maine Principals’ Association indefinitely delayed the winter sports season for schools around the state while the association works with stakeholders to develop COVID-19 safety protocols.
Mike Tracy, superintendent in Anson-based Regional School Unit 74, said he met Friday with other Somerset County superintendents, most of whom have districts that are already operating in a hybrid model.
“For us, the major change is the cancellation of extracurricular activities and an abrupt end to the fall sports season,” Tracy said.
RSU 74 was forced to delay the start of the school year in August after a student tested positive for the virus, but Tracy said he has been pleased by what appears to be a low transmission rate for the virus in schools around the state.
“I’m really proud to say from my understanding Maine schools have not been the transmitter of COVID-19,” Tracy said. “The community spread in other places where they’re not taking precautions are where we’re seeing the transmission.”
In Calais, Jenkins said his district is moving to remote learning through Nov. 30, although they will evaluate on a weekly basis to see whether it is possible to reintroduce any in-person learning. The district now has two positive cases among elementary school students and additional presumptive cases among staff.
He said the district was prepared for the move to remote learning. Earlier this year the district used coronavirus relief funds to purchase additional technology for students, and teachers and staff have had professional development. Delivery of breakfast and lunch to students who request meals will also continue, he said.
“We hate what’s happening, but we know what we have to do,” Jenkins said. “Our first priority is to keep students safe and faculty and everybody.
“We’re trying to do it. I guess only time will tell how well we’re doing, but I’d like to think we’re doing a good job and everyone will be fine.”

Bars set to reopen Monday, for now

Autor: Russell, Eric.

Información de publicación: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]. 31 Oct 2020: A.1.

Texto completo: Bars are still scheduled to reopen in Maine on Monday despite a record rise in new COVID-19 cases in recent days, but Gov. Janet Mills is considering pushing that back and perhaps tightening other restrictions as well, her office said late Friday afternoon.
"An announcement regarding actions to protect the health and safety of Maine people is likely this weekend," Mills' spokeswoman, Lindsay Crete, said in a statement to the Press Herald.
Maine tracked 103 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the highest daily total since the pandemic began. Cases have been rising steadily over the last week - the seven-day average is now 67.9, which also is a record. There hasn't been a COVID-19-related death since Oct. 17, but hospitalizations have been creeping up and deaths often lag behind cases.
At a news briefing Wednesday, Mills pleaded with Mainers to do their part to combat the spread but stopped short of saying she plans to impose more restrictions or delay the reopening of bars. She said transmission appears to be happening more at private gatherings, although there have been plenty of public outbreaks, including at churches and, as reported Thursday, at Pat's Pizza in Portland.
"It's not about my issuing an order today," she said. "It's about everybody using common sense and getting things under control."
On Friday, Crete said Mills is "deeply concerned" about rising case numbers in Maine and elsewhere and could be changing her mind.
"She is considering changes to indoor gathering limits, the list of states currently exempt from quarantine and testing requirements; the reopening of bars, tasting rooms and distilleries, and additional support for adherence to public health requirements," Crete said. "Like most Maine families, Governor Mills is very apprehensive about the spread of this deadly virus as we face colder weather and holidays that generally encourage gatherings of all sorts. Unfortunately, if we do not each take aggressive actions, this virus will be the uninvited guest to our family dinners and social gatherings."
The Snug, located at the foot of Munjoy Hill in Portland, has been closed since March.
The pub, which has virtually no outdoor seating, has been posting a series of original cartoons since June lampooning the state's decisions about which businesses are able to open (restaurants and gyms) and which are not (bars). And several of the cartoons take aim at Heather Sanborn, a state senator and owner of Rising Tide Brewing Co., and craft breweries in general, which have been going strong all summer.
"I am not a mega tasting room running spring break-esque tailgate parties every night of the week," Snug owner Margaret Lyons said in an email Friday night. "I'm a small neighborhood pub that is custom made for social distancing with high-walled booths and even higher ceilings."
Lyons said she was planning to open on Tuesday. To prepare, she removed half of her seating, ordered plexiglass for the bar, installed sanitation stations and set-up QR codes to collect people's contact information to help contact tracers in the event of an outbreak.
Lyons said she and her staff of three have been working hard - mentally and physically - to get the place into shape and put up signs to inform customers about the rules. She's stocked up on masks, gloves, shields and disinfectants. And she waited until the last possible minute to stock up on inventory, which she said arrived Friday afternoon.
To have the governor's office signal a change in her reopening plan at the last minute is "devastating," though not unexpected, she said. Not being able to reopen could force her to repay her Paycheck Protection Program loan, she said.
"Honestly, I'm at my breaking point. I have done everything. Everything," Lyons said. "We are ready. My bar is safe. ... We are all barely hanging on. If I could have a word with the governor, I would beg her to just let me open."
Back in May, Mills pushed back the reopening of restaurants for indoor dining in some counties where the virus was most prevalent. That decision drew criticism because it was made just days before some had planned to open, but the governor hasn't been shy about prioritizing public health.
Outbreaks have been linked to bars in several states that reopened establishments before Maine, and the country's top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned that bars can be dangerous spreading sites.
According to a report by National Public Radio in August, Louisiana rolled back its limited opening of bars after 400 people had caught the coronavirus just from interactions at those businesses. Texas and Arizona also closed down when infections skyrocketed. In Michigan, public health authorities have traced close to 200 cases to a pub in East Lansing.
Robert Horsburgh, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University, said Friday he understands the business reasons for wanting bars to reopen, but said it's risky.
"I love to go to the bar and have a beer, but I won't be going," he said. "I think it's risky and I don't think it makes sense from a public health point of view."
Since the pandemic reached Maine, Mills' administration has focused more on voluntary compliance of COVID-19 guidelines, but also has made it clear it's willing to enforce those guidelines when necessary. Just this week, state officials warned a Bangor business that planned to host a Trump campaign event, sending a letter that said, "the state would take all reasonable and practicable actions to protect the health and safety of Maine people" if guidelines are not followed. The business ended up backing out and the event was moved.
Bars, which are among the businesses in Maine that have been shuttered longest, have been scheduled to open Nov. 2 as part of Phase Four of Mills' reopening plan. Under that plan, capacity is limited to 50 percent or 100 people, whichever is fewer people.
The establishments will be expected to enforce rules that will make the bar experience more like going to a restaurant. Customers are expected to sit at their own table - maximum of eight people - and only get up to use the restroom or when entering and leaving the bar or restaurant. When not seated, customers will be expected to wear masks. Employees will be required to wear masks at all times.
In some states, bar owners have filed lawsuits challenging restrictions, but courts have sided with public health concerns.
"This idea that the epidemic can be stopped by voluntary action, that's just not true," Horsburgh said. "The government needs to set rules and help people navigate this."
Bars and restaurants have undoubtedly been among the businesses hardest hit. Many restaurants shifted to curbside service early on to earn back at least some of the revenue lost. Once the weather improved, outdoor dining helped. Bars haven't been able to do either.
This month, bar owners told the Press Herald that they were eagerly awaiting the chance to open their doors and said they were confident the safeguards put in place would protect employees and customers.
But that was before cases started becoming more widespread.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, warned Friday that "the surge is here."
"Take action now," he wrote on Twitter. "For your sake, and for the sake of your family and community, wear a mask and stay apart. This is serious."

Texto completo: About 40 people offer suggestions during a Zoom Community Conversation hosted by Hallowell organizations and the Maine Developmental Foundation.
HALLOWELL — Residents of Hallowell have their priorities: They want officials to improve the diversity of downtown businesses, improve infrastructure and enhance outdoor recreation.
Those were the topics raised Thursday night during a Zoom Community Conversation, organized by a group of Hallowell organizations seeking residents’ input.
Among those who ran the forum: The city’s Comprehensive Planning Group, Vision Hallowell, Hallowell’s Community Heart & Soul planning group, Hallowell All-Age Friendly Committee and the Hubbard Free Library.
After a short introduction, participants were divided into groups to discuss questions pertaining to short- and long-term goals for the city ahead of Election Day, which will see new city councilors and a new mayor elected.
During one of the group sessions, Judy Feinstein, a member of the city’s Planning Board, said she had heard some city residents want more diverse businesses on Water Street, aside from the places to get food and drink.
That sentiment was echoed by other residents, who said craft stores and other retailers would be welcome.
“There was a real strong feeling that people wanted a downtown that had more than a dozen places to pick from to have a beer and a burger, to put it nicely,” Feinstein said. “The question that comes into my mind is, ‘What else does downtown have to offer?’”
Ryan Gordon, a Greenville Street resident, said he would like the city’s downtown to be more “family friendly” and safer for pedestrians. He said he rarely travels downtown with his family because the heavy traffic makes it unsafe for pedestrians.
Gordon said that problem also expands into the residential areas of the city, where cars are also “zooming through.”
“It feels like a really dangerous place with traffic that feels too fast to bring a family there,” he said, advocating for better sidewalks, fewer cars and slower traffic through town. “The physical way people move about is very important.”
Matt Bear-Fowler, a Hallowell resident who said he uses a wheelchair to get around, said there are some businesses he and his family cannot patronize because they only have steps. He said that is another area where the city could improve.
“There’s just so much that does not meet Americans with Disabilities Act standards,” Bear-Fowler said. “It’s too bad because it excludes a lot of people.”
Resident Judith Graber said the city should also look into the effects of climate change, because Water Street’s proximity to the Kennebec River makes it prone to flooding. Further, she supported the pocket park concept at the corner of Water and Central streets, and the larger concept of adding more green space to the city’s downtown.
Related to “green” concerns and initiatives, Gordon said he is a member of Hallowell’s newly formed committee dealing with solar power, which has a goal of getting 80% of the city’s households on solar energy.
Other groups discussed an emphasis on buying locally and hosting more outdoor events as short-term strategies to bolster downtown Hallowell.
Other goals included continuing the Kennebec River Rail Trail through the city, and getting grants to clean the facades of downtown buildings.
For the long term, goals included affordable housing and better connecting Hallowell’s outer neighborhoods with downtown.
City Councilor George Lapointe, a candidate for mayor, said he was “pleased with the focus on making the Hallowell portion of the rail trail more user friendly, the discussion on multigenerational events to draw people to town and the mention of a structured approach to economic development in Hallowell.”
Lapointe’s opponent in the mayoral race, City Councilor Maureen AuCoin, who said she helped plan the event through work with both Comprehensive Planning Group and the Hallowell Heart & Soul project, said the forum echoed repeated calls for economic development and infrastructure maintenance in Hallowell.
She said she has already begun working on making the city more walkable.
“Recently, as the chair of the Highway Committee, I was successful in facilitating a plan for the city of Hallowell and DOT (Maine Department of Transportation) to address the need for a crosswalk near Stevens Commons,” she said. “This is a step towards the walkability and interconnectivity of neighborhoods that folks seem to be asking for.”

State looking into outbreak at Pat's Pizza in Old Port

Texto completo: State health officials said Pat's Pizza in Portland's Old Port is a "common connecting point" for 18 people who have contracted COVID-19 in the last two weeks.
Robert Long, spokesman for the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said investigators are looking into the possibility that the disease passed between patrons of the bar-restaurant on Oct. 16 and Oct. 22.
Long said that investigators doing contact tracing on the 18 people who are ill with the disease can connect them all through the pizza restaurant on those two dates, but "we have not determined that the establishment is the source of transmission." Long said none of those with the virus has required hospitalization.
Mike Lizotte, owner of the Portland franchise of the Maine-based chain of restaurants, said he has gotten the results of COVID-19 tests on most of his employees, and only one tested positive. He said that positive result came back on a "front of house" employee whom he declined to identify.
Lizotte said he's waiting for results on a small number of other employees, but all of those involved in preparing food have been cleared and he will remain open for takeout and delivery orders. State officials have recommended that he remain closed to in-person dining until Nov. 5 and Long said that's based on "the incubation period from the most recent exposure."
Lizotte said he was only informed about five customers contracting the virus - one last Friday, another on Sunday and three more on Monday.
Pat's Pizza was cited by Maine health inspectors in September for not requiring customers to wear masks while not seated at a table. Lizotte said he strictly enforces a rule requiring employees to wear masks and has hired security guards whose main task is to tell customers to wear masks.
"This is adult baby-sitting," he said. "We yell at them all the time."
Some commenters on the restaurant's Facebook page were critical of the pizza restaurant's decision to continue its takeout and delivery service and to reopen for in-restaurant dining late next week in the wake of the outbreak.
But Lizotte said the takeout business has been "a huge boost" that has helped him keep the restaurant afloat.
He also dismissed the criticism of his reopening decision, saying the Nov. 5 date is "not set in stone," but has been based on guidance from the Maine CDC.
Critics, he said, "can say whatever they want. They have no clue how to operate in this time. I'm going to lose a lot of money this weekend."
Lizotte said he bought the franchise two years ago and initially had to lay off his staff when the state ordered bars and restaurants to shut down to eat-in dining in March. But the combination of a strong takeout business and a federal payroll protection loan/grant allowed him to call the workers back after a few days, Lizotte said.
"We're just trying to make it work," he said.
Long said the state's investigation is continuing.
"Our primary focus right now is to ensure that those who have the virus receive the care and support they need, and that patrons or others who were potentially exposed are informed so they can take proper precautions," he said.

Texto completo: Skowhegan, Lawrence, MCI likely won't finish fall season after county receives yellow designation from Department of Education.
Maine Central Institute athletic director Jim Leonard couldn’t have been more blunt.
“We’re done,” Leonard said.
MCI suspended all athletics after the Department of Education designated Somerset County “yellow” on Friday, meaning there is an elevated risk of COVID-19 spread in the community. Washington and Waldo counties also received yellow designations.
Lawrence and Skowhegan also suspended athletics Friday, possibly bringing an end to their fall sports seasons.
The surge in coronavirus case numbers — the state reported 103 new infections Friday — raised some questions as to whether the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference cross country championship races would still be held Saturday in Waterville and Augusta.
The KVAC B race, which is scheduled at the quarry road trails in Waterville, will feature nine schools. Lawrence, Medomak Valley, Gardiner and Belfast will not compete at the KVAC B race because of COVID-19 concerns. Skowhegan is out of the KVAC A race in Augusta.
“We lost four schools in one week,” Oceanside athletic director Molly Bishop, the KVAC B cross country chairperson, said. “We are comfortable we can pull it off within all the guidelines. We can host this within the guidelines that were provided.”
Mike Bisson, a director at the Maine Principals’ Association, acknowledged there are some safety concerns with events that will attract student-athletes from several different communities. However, Bisson added the MPA would not step in and force a conference to cancel or postpone its championship meet.
“Everything is a concern when you bring kids together from different communities,” he said. “Now, cross country is a lower-risk activity. Hopefully, everything is OK. There are no easy answers.”
Lawrence cross country coach Tim Alberts said he had seven boys and five girls set to run in the KVAC B meet. At Thursday’s practice, Alberts noted the increasing number of COVID-19 cases statewide, particularly in Somerset County.
“I said ‘keep your fingers crossed that we don’t go into the yellow.’ They kind of knew this could be coming,” Alberts said. “I told Josiah Webber (who placed fourth at the KVAC meet last season), ‘This could be your state meet.’”
Leonard said he suspended four events at MCI: 7-on-7 football games against Foxcroft Academy and Bangor; a field hockey game against Cony; and a girls soccer game against Old Town.
“I almost got a full (fall) schedule in,” Leonard said.
The Skowhegan field hockey team had its game at nearby rival Messalonskee canceled Friday. Skowhegan coach Paula Doughty said she heard shortly after noon that the county’s yellow designation meant her team’s season was likely over.
Doughty was frustrated for her team.
“My kids have practiced all week in the rain,” she said. “This is so hard for the kids. My kids have said to me, this is the only thing that’s keeping them sane, participating in sports. This whole thing is awful… We’ll keep our fingers crossed and maybe we can make up these games at the end of next week.”

Disappointment is Collins' legacy to Maine voters A Mainer who is disabled and relies on the ACA says livelihoods and health care are at stake.

Texto completo: Maine voters like me have watched for years as Sen. Susan Collins disappointed us time and again - waffling over difficult issues, pretending to consider options, and ultimately making the wrong choices.
We waited to see how Sen. Collins would vote on Justice Brett Kava- naugh. She betrayed Maine women. We waited to see if she would defend small businesses in the Republican tax bill. She betrayed Maine businesspeople. We waited to see if she would hold this president accountable and vote to convict in the face of overwhelming evidence. She betrayed Mainers, whose values include fairness and justice.
Collins often says "I am disappointed" in the unequivocally unethical actions by the Trump administration and her party. I must say the feeling is mutual.
Maine cannot afford to let Susan Collins vote against us for six more years when the future of the Supreme Court, the Affordable Care Act and our democracy are at stake. We need a senator who will vote to protect our health, protect our jobs, protect our environment and begin to roll back the years of conservative court packing with extreme judges and justices like Amy Coney Barrett. I'm voting to fire Sen. Collins, and instead elect a senator who will stop disappointing Mainers, and put us first.
This is personal. I am disabled and use a wheelchair. I am an IT contractor without access to employer-based insurance. I rely on the ACA to help me access medication and care so I can keep working, paying taxes and contributing to my community. Without that access, I would be forced to live off of government disability.
I want to work. I want to contribute. I pay my taxes, I volunteer with charities and I work for businesses that bring money into Maine. I spend my income at our local businesses. And as a board member of the Disability Voters of Maine, I know there are many Mainers who are struggling with access to care and support for themselves or their loved ones. We need and deserve a senator who represents us, one who cares for us.
Sen. Collins supported the Republican tax bill that gutted the ACA individual mandate. If the Supreme Court rules against the ACA, as it now looks likely to do with newly confirmed Justice Barrett, an estimated 105,000 Mainers will be vulnerable to losing their health coverage as a result.
I was there in 1994 when Collins, then a Republican candidate for governor, won the Portland Press Herald's endorsement by saying politicians should "listen to the voters." Yet over the past four years of the Trump administration, Collins has proven herself unable to disassociate herself from the party of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell - a party that dismisses the rights of women and working people. We asked her to listen. She didn't.
There's a lot on the ballot this year. Our Senate votes could determine the future of our health care, our environment, our risk of COVID-19 and, perhaps most importantly, our Maine values.
If Collins stays in Washington next year, our livelihoods and our health care are in jeopardy. Who do you trust to make the right decision for Maine? Who do you trust to listen and take appropriate actions?
I am tired of being "disappointed" in the poor representation of our state. Sen. Collins was given the chance to fight for us, and she let us down. In this election, she will face the consequences.

Laurelai Winslow, 10, ready to show shooting prowess

Texto completo: Laurelai Winslow has shot five white-tailed deer since age 6. She will be among the Mainers taking part on opening day of the firearm season for deer on Saturday.
DAMARISCOTTA — Before the start of the spring hunting season, Laurelai Winslow had a heartfelt talk with her dad.
After years in which Tim Winslow followed his daughter on many of her successful hunts, she wanted to hunt alongside him — just as all hunting buddies do.
Tim Winslow shook his head and smiled when asked how he felt about his daughter’s earnest request, like a man at a loss for words. Laurelai Winslow, you see, is 10.
Laurelai already has built a hunting resume that would take many a lifetime to achieve. Since she started hunting at age 6, Laurelai has shot five white-tailed deer, two black bear, a caribou in Alaska, and nearly a dozen wild turkey.
The Winslows plan to be in the woods Saturday on opening day of Maine’s annual firearm season for white-tailed deer, which this year includes a record of 110,000 any-deer permit holders. Maine residents begin the hunt on Saturday; non-residents can start on Monday. The firearm season runs through Nov. 28, and is followed by the muzzleloader season, which ends Dec. 5.
Laurelai has two bonus deer tags, which means she could harvest up to three deer this fall. Do not bet against her: Two years ago, at age 8, she shot two deer using a bonus tag — all in one day.
Any hunter in Maine can harvest a buck with a general hunting license. But with a bonus tag from the deer-permit lottery — mostly allotted along the coast where state biologists want to thin the deer herd — a hunter can also harvest an additional deer for every bonus tag they win, although the bonus deer must be an antlerless deer (such as a doe or a buck without antlers).
Laurelai remembers that hunt in 2018 vividly, how she was “drawing on my pad, doodling,” in the hunting blind just after 6 a.m. when she looked up and saw “a big, big buck, with glowing antlers from the sun.”
She waited five minutes, until the eight-pointer turned broadside to make certain she had an ethical shot that would lead to a quick kill. Laurelai took that shot from 70 yards, without any instruction from her dad, and dropped the 185-pound buck.
Later that day when she stood in a family friend’s field in Warren, she saw a smaller “button buck” (an antlerless buck) and from 150 yards, Laurelai dropped the second deer without hesitation.
“On a hunt, she decides when to shoot,” said Tim Winslow, a Registered Maine Guide and carpenter. “And she decides when not to shoot. When she tells me she can make the shot, I know she can.”
Youth hunters in Maine can start at any age, as long as they are accompanied by an adult with a valid hunting license. Laurelai first harvested a white-tailed deer at age 6 — a 120-pound doe she shot from 70 yards.
“It was the biggest and prettiest thing in the world. I was so tiny I had never seen a deer that big up close,” said Laurelai, who hunted with her mother, Ali, that day. “(Dad) told me if the legs buck up, then you know you definitely hit it in the right place. I kept asking Mom after I shot: ‘Did I hit it? Did I hit it?’ And she kept saying, “Yup, you did.’”
Debbie Bocko, the Winslows former neighbor in Washington, met Laurelai four years ago when she asked Tim Winslow to teach her how to hunt. Laurelai ended up becoming a second mentor.
“I thought if this little 6-year-old can do it, I might be 64, but I can do it, too,” said Bocko, a homesteader who raises livestock on her 80-acre farm. “I’m part Native American and all about self-sufficiency and sustainability.
“She understands the hunt from beginning to end. It’s not about killing something. It’s about going out and harvesting an animal and providing food. She can field dress an animal better than I can.”
It is worth noting, Laurelai is the niece of the owner of the historic Libby Camps in the North Maine Woods, which date to 1880. But even Matt Libby, a Registered Maine Guide and float plane pilot, thinks his niece’s passion for hunting goes beyond her years.
“She is a rare breed, for sure,” Libby said. “My kids have already talked with her and apparently Kayla, my 12-year-old, is planning to buy me out; Parker, my 10-year-old, will be chief pilot; and Laurelai will be the head guide.”
At first glance, Laurelai Winslow appears to be a typical 10-year-old girl — and in many ways she is. She wears a big bow around her ponytail, has stuffed animals in her room and a chalkboard with artwork. She has colored her blond ponytail purple and blue to match that of her camo-clad Barbie, which Laurelai calls her “Hunting Barbie,” a doll she’s brought on hunts.
And Laurelai’s other deep passion is cheering with her grade school team. During a recent interview at her home, with the mounted grouse she shot behind her, Laurelai executed handstands, splits and backbends as she answered questions.
“If it’s a competition, then I like cheering better,” Laurelai said. “But if it’s just cheering practice, then hunting.”
Ali and Tim Winslow, both avid hunters, first started taking their daughter along on bird and deer hunts when she was 18-months-old, outfitting her with ear protection and carrying her in a pack. They brought her to the shooting range at age 4 — making short trips to make it fun, but also to constantly work on safe gun handling skills and accuracy. She took to it, and became a crack shot like her mother.
“My dad told me when they taught me, ‘You have to hit the target where you’re supposed to. And when you can, I’ll take you hunting,’” Laurelai said. “I really wanted to go. So I practiced a lot.”
The Winslows taught Laurelai shot placement: where to always shoot an animal to assure a quick kill. With a life-size plastic deer in their backyard, the Winslows still quiz Laurelai.
Bocko said her young friend’s love of hunting is obvious. One time when she was turkey hunting in a blind with Tim and Laurelai and Bocko’s scope stopped working, Laurelai passed her shotgun to Bocko and told her to use it instead. And one year when Bocko didn’t harvest a deer on her farm, Laurelai gave her half the venison from her deer, to thank Bocko for letting her hunt there.
“She’s very unselfish,” Bocko said. “She has the skill, and she’s good at it. But she’s got that sense of responsibility and knowledge. She’ll let deer go by rather than go out there and wound an animal. She’s a strong young woman. And she’s an inspiration for me, to see the next generation coming along.”

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention only reports specific COVID-19 case numbers in ZIP codes with at least 2,000 residents that have had more than five cases or zero cases. As a result, prevalence rates cannot be determined in some smaller communities with multiple known cases of COVID-19. The figures above represent total cases to date, including individuals who have recovered from the disease.

Texto completo: Maine added two more counties Friday to its list of those where it recommends schools offer hybrid instruction amid the state's surge in coronavirus case numbers.
The Department of Education designated Somerset and Washington counties as yellow, meaning they have an elevated risk of COVID-19 spread. Hybrid instruction is recommended as a way of limiting the number of people in schools and classrooms at any one time. Waldo County, which received a yellow designation last week, remains yellow. The 13 other counties are green.
The changes come as Maine reported its highest single-day tally of coronavirus cases on Friday, with 103 new infections recorded around the state. In the last 30 days there have been 128 cases reported among students and staff in Maine schools.
The largest outbreak at a school so far has been at the Community Regional Charter School in Skowhegan and Cornville, which has reported 18 cases, though school officials said last week that everyone affected has recovered.
Most schools in Maine are already operating in hybrid models, but the transition hasn't been easy and it's even more complicated for schools that have had to shift between instructional models in response to cases.
"I've never had a problem that I felt so frustrated with," Calais School Department Superintendent Ronald Jenkins said. "We're getting bombarded in so many directions with what's right and a different version of what's right. It's very difficult for us and I think that's true of every superintendent in the state. It's hard and quite frankly, they don't teach you that in superintendent school."
The Washington County district already opted to move to fully remote learning for its students Wednesday, so Jenkins said the state's yellow designation won't change things much. "We're already following CDC guidance for the red designation," he said.
Washington County is the site of a 27-person outbreak at Second Baptist Church, and the county's two-week population-adjusted case rate is four times higher than it was last week.
Waldo County continues to have Maine's highest per county positivity rate at 3 percent and a new case rate of 17.4 percent. No outbreaks have been identified in Waldo or Washington county schools at this time.
The state's color advisory system, which is run by the Department of Education in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services and Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, is meant as a recommendation. Final decisions on instructional models are left up to individual school districts.
When the state launched the system in July, it originally said the advisories would be updated on a two-week cycle. However, the data is continually reviewed and Department of Education spokeswoman Kelli Deveaux said Friday that the timeline is not fixed and flexibility is necessary to ensure timely updates to schools. She said the significant increases in statewide cases necessitated Friday's updates and that another update is anticipated next week.
While most of the state has been "green" since the start of the school year, meaning in-person instruction is allowed, most districts have opted for "yellow" models in order to adhere to the state's required physical distance and safety guidelines. The DOE suggests that under a yellow model schools may want to take additional precautions such as suspending extracurricular activities and sports or limiting the number of people in buildings at one time.
Earlier this week the Maine Principals' Association indefinitely delayed the winter sports season for schools around the state while the association works with stakeholders to develop COVID-19 safety protocols.
Mike Tracy, superintendent in Anson-based Regional School Unit 74, said he met Friday with other Somerset County superintendents, most of whom have districts that are already operating in a hybrid model. "For us, the major change is the cancellation of extracurricular activities and an abrupt end to the fall sports season," Tracy said.
RSU 74 was forced to delay the start of the school year in August after a student tested positive for the virus, but Tracy said he has been pleased by what appears to be a low transmission rate for the virus in schools around the state.
"I'm really proud to say from my understanding Maine schools have not been the transmitter of COVID-19," Tracy said. "The community spread in other places where they're not taking precautions are where we're seeing the transmission."
In Skowhegan-based School Administrative District 54 in Somerset County, Superintendent Jon Moody wrote in a letter to the community Friday that the new yellow designation means that until further notice all sports, competitions and after-school activities will no longer occur in-person.
Because SAD 54 is already operating in a hybrid model, Moody said he didn't anticipate any further changes to instruction other than a quarantine for some students and staff at Canaan Elementary School, where the CDC reported a probable case of the virus in a staff member on Friday.
In Calais, Jenkins said his district is moving to remote learning through Nov. 30 though they will re-evaluate on a weekly basis to see whether it's possible to reintroduce any in-person learning. The district currently has two positive cases among elementary school students and additional presumptive cases among staff.
He said the district was prepared for the move to remote learning. Earlier this year the district used coronavirus relief funds to purchase additional technology for students, and teachers and staff have had professional development. Delivery of breakfast and lunch to students who request meals will also continue, he said.
"We hate what's happening, but we know what we have to do," Jenkins said. "Our first priority is to keep students safe and faculty and everybody. We're trying to do it. I guess only time will tell how well we're doing, but I'd like to think we're doing a good job and everyone will be fine."

Texto completo: Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Maine ticked up in the past week, with a geographic pattern that parallels the wider distribution in new cases as the state experiences a record surge of positive tests.
Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 inpatient admissions have been concentrated at major hospitals in Maine's three southernmost counties. But this week's increases were primarily at hospitals in other parts of the state, with an unprecedented number of small hospitals having inpatients at the same time.
The total number of COVID-19 inpatients statewide is still low compared to other states. The count stood at 17 Friday, according to Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, well below the peak of 60 on May 26. But the agency Friday reported a record-breaking 103 new cases of the disease, which is spreading at twice the rate of a month ago.
"It's a strong warning for all of us," said Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, the state's largest hospital network and parent of Maine Medical Center. "I would not say we are in a surge, but that we have all the ingredients for a surge and it's baking."
"We knew we would probably have a surge in the winter," she added, "but I am concerned that all the ingredients are there and it's still fall."
In a given week during the crisis, one or two of Maine's smaller hospitals might have reported having a pandemic inpatient or two for a few days but would go weeks or even months without one. But this week many of these smaller hospitals had inpatients, including Franklin Memorial in Farmington, Waldo General in Belfast, York Hospital, Bridgton Hospital and A.R. Gould in Presque Isle.
PenBay Medical Center in Rockport and Rumford Hospital both had a higher average daily inpatient load than Maine Med this week, reporting 2 and 1.3 cases, respectively. In PenBay's case, this week's total of nightly COVID-19 inpatient counts - 14 - represented two-thirds of the hospital's total tally for the entire pandemic.
York Hospital had its busiest week since late August with 1.1 patients a day. Erich Fogg, who oversees COVID-19 testing at the hospital and its drive-thru rapid testing locate on Route 1, said it has also seen a steady rise in the proportion of tests coming back positive, with Thursday's total count of 80 being the largest daily figure yet. "We're heading into a concerning trend line," he said.
Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor had its busiest week since July, averaging 1.7 COVID-19 inpatients a day for the period, while MaineGeneral in Augusta had 2.4 a day, its busiest week since the late May surge.
By contrast, Portland's hospitals were both unusually quiet for the week ending Thursday, with Maine Med reporting an average of only 0.9 patients per day, down from the low-to-mid 30s per day during the disease's peak surges in early April and late May. Mercy Hospital hasn't had a COVID-19 inpatient since Sept. 28.
The largest hospital in York County, Southern Maine Health Care Medical Center, also had 0.9 patients per day, while Mid Coast in Brunswick last had a COVID-19 inpatient on Oct. 2.
Androscoggin County's major hospitals were quiet. Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston had 0.9 inpatients a day, less than half its burden in late September and the first half of October. Lewiston's other hospital, St. Mary's, had no COVID-19 inpatients at all for the period, whereas it had at least one every day from Sept. 26 to Oct. 19.
"The window is getting narrower to get this under control, and it's all in our hands," said Mills, a former director of the Maine CDC and younger sister of Gov. Janet Mills. "It's the 'three W's': Watch your distance, wear a mask, and wash your hands."
Hospitalizations are a lagging indicator in that they typically occur one to three weeks after a person is exposed to the disease, but unlike other metrics, it is not dependent on who and how many people were tested. They can end three ways: recovery, death or transfer to another facility.
The Press Herald's survey is for the seven days ending Oct. 29. It compiles data received directly from the hospitals and hospital networks. The data do not include outpatients or inpatients who were suspected of having the virus but never tested. The survey includes most of the state's hospitals and accounts for the vast majority of the statewide hospitalizations reported each week by the Maine CDC.

MS: New Maine COVID-19 cases leap by 103, as surge accelerates

Texto completo: Forty-four of the new cases are in Cumberland County, where outbreaks have been connected to Pat's Pizza in Portland and the Maine Correctional Center in Windham.
Maine shattered its daily record for COVID-19 cases Friday, with 103 new infections reported as the virus continues to spread widely across the state.
Gov. Janet Mills said she is considering a range of steps in response to the surge, such as delaying the scheduled opening of bars on Monday and reducing the maximum size of indoor gatherings.
Also on Friday, as a result of worsening trends, three counties — Waldo, Somerset and Washington — were designated “yellow” by the Maine Department of Education, which means school sports and extracurricular activities will be curtailed.
Forty-four of the new cases are in Cumberland County, 11 in Somerset County and nine cases each in York County and Kennebec County. There were no additional deaths.
Cumberland County has seen cases jump from 16 on Wednesday to 22 on Thursday and 44 on Friday.
Recent Cumberland County outbreaks include 18 cases at Pat’s Pizza in the Old Port in Portland, and 18 cases at the Maine Correctional Center in Windham.
Cases keep climbing in Maine after a long period of relatively stable, low case counts. There were 80 new cases on Thursday and 76 on Wednesday.
The seven-day daily average of new cases stood at 67.9 on Friday, compared to 37 a week ago and 30.4 a month ago.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said in a tweet Friday: “The surge is here. Take action now. For your sake, and for the sake of your family and community, wear a mask and stay apart. This is serious.”
Testing has increased substantially over the past week, Shah said. The seven-day daily average of COVID-19 tests performed was 519 tests per 100,000 population Friday, a jump of 15% to 25% compared to the previous month. Testing has fluctuated between about 400 tests per 100,000 to 450 tests per 100,000, according to the Maine CDC.
But the percentage of tests that have been returned as positive has also increased, with the seven-day daily average going from 0.49% two weeks ago to 0.83% ON Friday.
The national average is about 7%, so Maine is doing much better than the national average, but the increase in the positivity rate is a worrisome trend, Shah said. The higher the positivity rate, the harder it is for public health workers to tamp down on outbreaks and prevent exponential growth of the virus.
Robert Long, Maine CDC spokesman, said in an email that while testing volume is robust, “the increase in cases appears most likely to result from community transmission.”
“The continued rise in the seven-day positivity rate offers another indication that the increase in cases derives more from community transmission than additional testing,” Long said.
The steady rise in case counts comes a day after Maine announced a partnership with Walgreens, which will stock free rapid antigen tests that can produce results within 15 minutes.
The rapid tests are expected to be in 65 Walgreens locations throughout Maine as a drive-thru service starting sometime in November. A doctor’s note is not needed for the rapid tests, and anyone who thinks they need a test can get one under Maine’s standing order for COVID-19 tests.
Patients will “self-swab” their nasal cavity under the supervision of a pharmacy employee. The nasal swabs are less invasive than the deep nasal swab tests in use by what up until now has been the more common COVID-19 PCR molecular tests, which typically return results within 24 to 48 hours in Maine.
Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, said in a conference call with reporters on Friday that Maine’s partnership with Walgreens is a “great idea” because the state can “leverage the (retail) footprint of Walgreens to make testing more accessible.”
Mina has been advocating for the expansion of rapid testing as a key tool to help suppress the virus. Maine will receive 400,000 of the rapid antigen tests by the end of the year, with more expected for 2021. The tests will help people working in essential jobs — such as health care, police, fire, paramedics and teachers — to return to work if they have been exposed to COVID-19 but test negative and do not show symptoms.
“We need to be thinking about every part of this as strategic,” Mina said. “Walgreens is really well situated to work with departments of health in Maine and other states to develop these strategies.”
Current hospitalizations were at 17 on Friday, with five people in intensive care.
The inpatient population has begun to inch higher and is more dispersed among the state’s hospitals.

WATERVILLE — The Alfond Youth & Community Center will provide free Thanksgiving dinners from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 21, in the center’s parking lot at 126 North St. The drive through event is open to everyone in the community. Simply drive up and tell one of the volunteers how many meals you want.
A total of 800 individually packaged meals will be handed out, according to a news release from the center.
Also, because of the support of Central Maine Motors, youth can take home Feast Fixings to Go, the ingredients for their families’ to cook a full Thanksgiving dinner, including the frozen turkey, on Thursday and Friday, Nov. 19 and 20.
Feast Fixings to Go will be available to AYCC’s after-school program youth in Waterville, Fairfield Community Center, and Regional School Unit 18’s Williams and Atkins.
In 2019, more than 800 full dinners were provided to community residents, including individuals from Sacred Heart Soup Kitchen, Families Matter, Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter, KVCAP North End Teen Center and AYCC After School Program, according to the release.
Because the average American family spends $50 on Thanksgiving dinner, donations are needed. A donation of​ $50 feeds 25 people at the drive through dinner, or two families’ dinner in a bag. A donation of​ $25 feeds 15 people at the drive through dinner, or one family’s dinner in a Bag.
To donate, visit alfondyouthcenter-ivsrq.formstack.com/forms/donations1_copy_4.
With the support of multiple community donors and volunteers the AYCC cooks more than 50 turkeys to serve 800 meals and hands out 150 Thanksgiving Turkey Dinners-in-a-bag for families in need.

The Hallowell native, Bowdoin College graduate and ordained minister taught mathematics and natural philosophy for four years at Amherst College, then directed the Mount Vernon Female School in Boston.

While still a young man, he moved to Farmington, where his brother Samuel Abbott had founded the Abbott Family School for Boys at Little Blue. Samuel Abbott died a few years later, so Jacob Abbott took over its management briefly with his sisters. They sold it and moved across the road to Few Acres, which remained their home after that, although Abbott spent winters in New York.
Abbott’s brothers John Abbott and Gorham Dummer Abbott also were authors, as were his sons, Benjamin, Austin, Lyman and Edward.

Texto completo: Rep. Maggie O'Neil is facing a challenge from Marc Chappell for the seat representing House District 15 in Saco.
O'Neil is a Democrat who is studying law at the University of Maine School of Law and has served in the Legislature for four years. Chappell is a Republican and works as a firefighter.
Here are their responses to questions about a series of issues.
Marc Chappell
Are you satisfied with the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic? No. Hospital capacities showed they were not overrun with patients, the state should have been opened earlier. Especially the counties that had very low numbers. Small business have been devastated.
State budget: Every aspect of the budget will be reduced. Hiring freezes. All state entities will have to take a cut across the board. Non-priority projects will be shelved. Open up the state to increase revenues.
Most pressing matter pertaining to young Mainers: Keeping the young generation living in Maine. Create good-paying jobs and bring in good companies. Need more focus on technical careers and jobs in the trades. We have the oldest population in the USA.
Is there anything in particular that you hope to accomplish? Everyone's goal should be to recover Maine from this pandemic and commit to rejuvenating all small businesses, creating jobs and getting all citizens to a quality of life they desire.
For more informationon Marc Chappell, go to www.facebook.come/chappell4saco or www.facebook.com/mchappell2
Maggie O'Neil
Are you satisfied with the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Yes. Two opportunities to improve are transparency in process and increased community and stakeholder input, especially for small businesses, in putting together practical and effective guidelines.
State budget: Maine is already in a stronger position than other states because we have prepared by reserving $258 million in the "Rainy Day Fund." We will need to tighten our belts and examine revenue loopholes.
Most pressing matter pertaining to young Mainers: Young people want to vote for leaders who are actually fighting for a better world for all of us. That includes addressing climate change, student debt, health care access and societal injustices.
Is there anything in particular that you hope to accomplish? This term, I led efforts to require big pharma companies to fund addiction treatment and prevention in Maine. I will build on that success to help more of our neighbors access health care and support.

Texto completo: Maine shattered its daily record for COVID-19 cases on Friday, with 103 new infections reported as the virus continues to spread widely across the state.
Gov. Janet Mills indicated that she is considering a range of steps in response to the surge, such as delaying the scheduled reopening of bars on Monday and reducing the maximum size of indoor gatherings.
Also on Friday, as a result of worsening trends, two counties - Somerset and Washington - joined Waldo County in the Maine Department of Education's yellow designation, which means hybrid learning is recommended and school sports and extracurricular activities will be curtailed. Maine's 13 other counties are in the green zone.
Forty-four of the new cases are in Cumberland County, 11 in Somerset County and nine cases each in York and Kennebec counties. There were no additional deaths. Cumberland County has seen cases jump from 16 on Wednesday to 22 on Thursday and 44 on Friday.
Recent Cumberland County outbreaks include 18 cases at Pat's Pizza in the Old Port in Portland, and 18 cases at the Maine Correctional Center in Windham.
Cases keep climbing in Maine after a long period of relatively stable, low case counts. There were 80 new cases on Thursday and 76 on Wednesday.
The seven-day daily average of new cases stood at 67.9 on Friday, compared to 37 a week ago and 30.4 a month ago.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a tweet Friday that "the surge is here. Take action now. For your sake, and for the sake of your family and community, wear a mask and stay apart. This is serious."
Testing has increased substantially over the past week, Shah said. The seven-day daily average of COVID-19 tests performed was 519 tests per 100,000 population on Friday, a jump of 15-25 percent compared to the previous month. Testing has fluctuated between about 400 tests per 100,000 to 450 tests per 100,000, the Maine CDC said.
But the percentage of tests that have been returned as positive also has increased, with the seven-day daily average going from 0.49 percent two weeks ago to 0.83 on Friday. The national average is about 7 percent, so Maine is doing much better than the rest of the country, but the increase in the positivity rate is a worrisome trend, Shah said. The higher the positivity rate, the harder it is for public health workers to tamp down on outbreaks and prevent exponential growth of the virus.
Robert Long, Maine CDC spokesman, said in an email that while testing volume is robust, "the increase in cases appears most likely to result from community transmission."
"The continued rise in the seven-day positivity rate offers another indication that the increase in cases derives more from community transmission than additional testing," Long said.
The steady rise in case counts comes a day after Maine announced a partnership with Walgreens, which will stock free rapid antigen tests that can produce results within 15 minutes.
The rapid tests are expected to be in 65 Walgreens locations throughout Maine as a drive-thru service starting sometime in November. A doctor's note is not needed for the rapid tests, and anyone who thinks they need a test can get one under Maine's standing order for COVID-19 tests.
Patients will "self-swab" their nasal cavity under the supervision of a pharmacy employee. The nasal swabs are less invasive than the deep nasal swab tests used in the more common COVID-19 PCR molecular tests, which typically return results within 24 to 48 hours in Maine.
Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, said in a conference call with reporters on Friday that Maine's partnership with Walgreens is a "great idea" because the state can "leverage the (retail) footprint of Walgreens to make testing more accessible."
Mina has been advocating for the expansion of rapid testing as a key tool to help suppress the virus. Maine will receive 400,000 of the rapid antigen tests by the end of the year, with more expected in 2021. The tests will help health care workers, police, firefighters, paramedics, teachers and other essential workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 return to work sooner if they test negative and don't have symptoms.
"We need to be thinking about every part of this as strategic," Mina said. "Walgreens is really well situated to work with departments of health in Maine and other states to develop these strategies."
Current hospitalizations were at 17 on Friday, with five people in intensive care. The inpatient population has begun to inch higher and is more dispersed among the state's hospitals.

Texto completo: Cumberland County
Sheriff warns of scam targeting grandparents
Police are warning residents about a telephone scam in which a caller impersonates someone's grandchild and then asks for money to be sent to them immediately.
The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office warned about the so-called grandparent scam, which has increased in prevalence in recent months and relies on the fact that most grandparents would do almost anything for their grandchildren, the sheriff's office said.
The scam begins with a telephone call by someone who purports to be the target's grandchild. The scammer then tells the targeted person that they are in trouble and need money immediately. Sometimes the scammer tells the target that they are in jail and need cash for bail, or that they are in trouble and need to hire an attorney.
Some cases involve a second scammer, who gets on the phone and claims to be an attorney for the grandchild who is in trouble. Other variations involve the scammer telling the target that they are traveling, lost their money or identification, and need cash fast to get home.
In every variation, the scam involves creating a heightened sense of immediacy, the sheriff's office said. Sometimes the scammers are able to gather information about the family that is not readily available, adding a sense of realism to the scam.
"Grandparents have lost thousands of dollars because they have done what every grandparent would do, and that is to respond immediately and send money to a scammer thinking that they were actually helping their grandchild out of trouble," the sheriff's office wrote in a statement. It was unclear how many local residents have fallen victim to the scam, or how much money they have lost cumulatively.
Anyone who receives such a call should ask for a call-back number and verify the validity of the call before giving over any information, money or credit card information, or to simply call the grandchild directly to verify that the call is real, the sheriff's office saids.
BOWDOIN
Car runs over campaign sign for President Trump
A Donald Trump campaign sign in Bowdoin was destroyed this week after it was run over by a car - an act that the property owner believes was premeditated.
John Pride, a homeowner in Bowdoin, said the 4-by-8 foot Trump sign was placed on his land at the corner of Routes 201 and 125 on Sunday.
By Monday, the sign had been knocked over, but Pride said he and Peter Lewis, chairman of the Bowdoinham Board of Selectmen and a candidate for the State House of Representative District 55 seat, gave the situation the benefit of the doubt and blamed the wind. They reinforced the sign and drove posts 18 inches into the ground to make sure it would stay up.
The next morning, the sign was in pieces, with blue paint on the 2x4s and tire tracks in the ground.
Pride called the act, which he believes was intentional, "disgusting," "immature" and "irresponsible." He has since put the sign back together and screwed it to his fence.
Lewis called the Sagadahoc Sheriff's Office after speaking with Pride on Wednesday. An officer investigated, but so far there have been no charges brought forward.
LEWISTON
State says CMMC didn't follow COVID protocols
Central Maine Medical Center allowed employees to walk through the hospital without masks, didn't consistently or correctly screen workers and visitors entering the building, and failed to keep its Intensive Care Unit clean even as the hospital was dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak that started in the ICU, state investigators say.
In a report issued in August and released this week to the Sun Journal, investigators said the hospital's actions put people in immediate jeopardy, causing a situation in which a patient already had or likely could die or suffer serious injury. CMMC was ordered to quickly fix its problems, and hospital officials say they have.
CMMC's COVID-19 outbreak began the third week of July and lasted well into August. In all, 17 people were infected, including 15 employees and two patients. According to the hospital, almost 50 people had to quarantine, most of them connected to the ICU.
John Alexander, chief medical officer for the health system, said CMMC immediately fixed the issues raised by investigators. The report acknowledged that CMMC officials quickly created a plan of correction and fixed the problems.
Those fixes include better screening for employees and visitors, as well as entrances that are restricted and monitored.
Three students at Bates test positive
Three more students at Bates College tested positive for COVID-19 this week, part of a surge of new cases in Maine.
The new tests show there are four active cases among the more than 1,700 students at the college, all of them in isolation housing to help thwart further spread of the coronavirus.
Joshua McIntosh, dean of students, said in a message Friday to the Bates community that after contact tracing Thursday evening, it does not appear the new cases are related to each other, "meaning that there does not appear to be a common source for the transmission."
College officials said Friday that the lack of a common source indicates a need to be even more vigilant than Bates has been, particularly in light of a growing number of infections in Maine in recent days.
Until this week, the college had largely avoided any problems, with a total of three student cases on campus this semester, two of them near the start of school in late August and early September.
The three new positive tests were among 824 tests done Tuesday, according to the Bates COVID-19 dashboard and several college officials.
WESTBROOK
Teens who fled medical facility found unharmed
Two teenagers who fled a Westbrook facility were found safe this week, police said.
Dylan Collins, 15, and Isaiah Loring, 14, fled from a medical facility in Westbrook, police there said Wednesday.
Officers located one teenager the same day, said Capt. Steven Goldberg. The other teen was found in Lewiston on Thursday.
Both were reunited with their families.

Texto completo: Coronavirus is on the rise again in Maine and across the nation. Uncertainty abounds. Next week's election will have profound consequences for all of us.
So what's a small business to do?
Be innovative and seek help.
Ryan Wallace, director of the University of Southern Maine's Center for Business & Economic Research, assembled a five-year forecast for Maine's economy, and 2025 still doesn't figure to surpass the levels achieved in 2019.
Even so, he's optimistic. The crisis has forced businesses, households and other organizations to be innovative in order to survive.
"We should embrace (that) and come out better, more resilient on the other side, though it will take time," he said. "I'm bullish on Maine. This is a potential turning point and opportunity for the state."
Wallace joined Richard Arend, a professor of strategic management at USM's business school, on an hourlong webinar Friday morning put on by the Maine Small Business Development Centers. An audience of 140 people included policymakers, town officials and representatives of economic development organizations.
Arend presented findings from a survey taken in July and August of roughly 500 small businesses across the state. More than half (54.5 percent) of those businesses had to close at least temporarily because of COVID-19, with two in three doing so by government mandate and the other third doing so voluntarily, for health or economic reasons.
Among the surprising findings was that, although a little more than half of respondents took advantage of the federal Paycheck Protection Program, doing so didn't correlate significantly with small business owners' expectations of their firm surviving the next year. Significant correlations between closing during the pandemic and potential failure included whether the business depended on tourism, was related to service, focused on retail or had little or no online integration.
On the positive side, Arend said he found more optimism and innovation than he expected. He urged small business owners to "use the crisis to make the improvements you have been putting off and that will help you be more competitive when the recovery comes. Push for and apply for help from your policy makers that will make it easier for you to innovate and to be more certain of the future."
Wallace said the recession has been harder on low-wage workers (since January one in four jobs has disappeared for those making less than $27,000 annually) and women (who account for 55 percent of unemployment claims) in Maine.
His forecast model shows unemployment tapering off over the next two years from the current 8.6 percent below pre-pandemic levels to 5.4 next year and 3.2 in 2022 before settling in at 2.3 for the following two years. That's assuming no new stimulus or infrastructure package, which could arrive sooner depending on the outcome of next week's election.
His model also anticipates vaccine readiness at some point next year with dissemination throughout the general population by the end of 2021, he said.
Wallace pointed to exciting developments in Maine's heritage sectors of forest products, marine industry and food economy as well as major philanthropic investments and opportunities to attract newcomers (through remote work) to a state with a declining population.
"Not that there isn't a lot of pain in the interim, but we will get through this," he said, "and we will be better."

Texto completo: Applications sought by Maine residents who are employed by a Maine-based business in the STEM-related fields.
The Harold Alfond Foundation and the Finance Authority of Maine are seeking applications for student loan debt relief for Maine residents who are employed by a Maine-based business in the STEM-related fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Applications are being accepted through Nov. 15. The Alfond Leaders program assists Maine employers in attracting and retaining talented STEM professionals by providing student loan debt relief of up to $60,000 per recipient, according to a news release from FAME.
The foundation recently invested $500 million in making Maine a great place to live, work and learn. The Alfond Leaders is just one more example of the foundation’s ongoing investment in the effort to attract and retain qualified STEM workers for Maine’s future.
An applicant must have a higher education degree or certificate, or be graduating by May 31, 2021, in order to apply during this current application collection period.
Applicants will be recruited from across the nation, and current Maine residents are eligible and encouraged to apply.
An Alfond Leaders Advisory Committee assists in the selection of applicants and recommends candidates.
Who is eligible? Maine residents or persons who will become Maine residents upon being hired by a Maine-based employer; a person employed, or who will be employed, by a Maine-based employer in a designated STEM occupation.
Applicants must have a higher education degree or certificate or be graduating by May 31, 2021 to apply in this current application cycle (Nov. 15 – March 15, 2021), and have outstanding student loan debt.
Candidates must submit an application, including a written essay, an official college transcript and resume, a statement of intent to live and work in Maine for six years; an employment certification by a Maine-based employer; and disclosure of the amount, source, and terms of the student loan indebtedness.
Those selected to become Alfond Leaders will receive debt reduction payments made on their behalf, paid in two disbursements after three and six years respectively, of qualifying employment.

56 students, staff members quarantining after probable positive case of COVID-19 at Canaan Elementary School

Texto completo: Under the direction of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, the two classrooms will be quarantined, with 47 students and nine staff members sent home.
CANAAN — Students from two of the three classrooms at Canaan Elementary School are now quarantining at home after a probable positive case of COVID-19 was reported Friday to administrators.
The latest report brings the number of probable cases at the school to two, with one confirmed case of COVID-19 infection, according to officials.
Jon Moody, the superintendent in Maine School Administrative District 54, said the confirmed positive case involves a staff member.
Under the direction of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, the two classrooms will be quarantined, with 47 students and nine staff members sent home.
Students were equipped with “learning devices” when they left school Friday, according to Moody.
The additional probable positive case, like the other cases the district has had, was reportedly a result of contact with an individual outside of school.
“We will be working with Maine CDC and our local community partners over the course of the weekend to determine next steps,” Moody said in the letter. “A positive aspect of this investigation is that it has affirmed that school cohorting and masking have had their intended effect in limiting the spread of COVID-19.”
The letter was sent just after Somerset County was deemed “yellow” under the Department of Education’s reopening advisory system. On Friday, 103 new infections were reported, making it the state’s highest single-day spike in coronavirus cases.
“Until further notice, all sports, competitions and after-school activities will no longer occur in person,” said Moody, who leads a school district that includes Canaan, Cornville, Mercer, Norridgewock, Smithfield and Skowhegan.
The district was already operating under a hybrid-cohorting approach, and Moody said administrators did not anticipate any changes as a result of the “yellow” designation for Somerset County.
Earlier this month, the district sent students home to work remotely for two days after a student at Skowhegan Area High School tested positive for COVID-19. Two days later, a student at Mill Stream Elementary School in Norridgewock tested positive. In both cases, it was determined the students’ contact with the virus occurred outside of school.
Students in prekindergarten through sixth grade are learning in person five days a week, while grades seven through 12 are learning under a hybrid model divided by last names.

Absentee ballots pour in, and nearly half of registered Mainers have voted

Texto completo: Nearly half of all registered voters in Maine already have cast their ballots heading into the weekend before Election Day.
As of Friday afternoon, Maine voters had returned 477,817 of the 522,962 absentee ballots issued by by local clerks, according to the latest figures from the Secretary of State's Office. Record numbers of voters are using the absentee balloting process in Maine - which allows mail-in, drop-off or in-person absentee voting - rather than voting at the polling place on Election Day during the coronavirus pandemic.
For an absentee ballot to be counted, it must be returned to local clerks by 8 p.m. Tuesday.
With a contentious presidential election and a high-profile U.S. Senate race, state election officials expect voter participation during the 2020 election to match or exceed turnout in 2016. Roughly 73 percent of registered Maine voters participated in the 2016 elections, which was the second-highest voter participation rate in the nation after Minnesota. Secretary of State Matt Dunlap has said he expects from 70 to 75 percent of registered voters to cast ballots this year.
Just under 772,000 voters cast ballots in the last presidential election. So if turnout this year is on par with 2016, more than 60 percent of the votes already would have been cast as of Friday afternoon, based on the latest absentee ballot return figures.
Maine's absentee balloting process allows voters to vote by mail or in-person-but-early at many polling places for any reason. The deadline for eligible registered voters to request an absentee ballot was Thursday, and voters had until 5 p.m. Friday to cast an in-person absentee ballot at their town office. The 523,702 absentee ballots requested as of Friday afternoon included those being cast in-person at town offices.
Democrats have returned ballots at more than twice the pace as Republicans, although they were also more likely to request absentee ballots than their Republican counterparts.
Democrats, who are the largest voting block in Maine, accounted for 229,808 of the 477,817 returned ballots returned as of Friday afternoon, or 48 percent of the total. Unenrolled or independent voters, the second-largest group, had returned 119,129 ballots as of Friday. Republicans followed close behind with 113,241 ballots returned. Voters registered as Green Independents had returned 15,644 ballots.
Portland voters had returned 29,270 ballots as of Friday with roughly 4,000 ballots still outstanding. In 2016, there were 38,577 ballots cast in total for president in Portland. Lewiston residents had returned 12,009 absentee ballots, leaving roughly 800 issued but not yet marked as returned on the Secretary of State's tally.
In Augusta, clerks reported receiving 6,259 ballots as of Friday with roughly 550 still outstanding. And in Bangor, voters had returned 12,605 absentee ballots out of the 13,622 that had been issued as of Friday afternoon.

Texto completo: Republican Rep. Matthew Harrington faces a challenge from Democrat Patricia Kidder in his bid for a fourth term representing House District 19.
Harrington has represented the district, which includes part of Sanford and Springvale, for the past five years. Kidder, who has not previously run for office, has advocated for social and economic justice issues in Augusta.
Harrington, a police officer, serves on the Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business. He previously served two terms on State and Local Government.
In the last legislative session, he co-sponsored a bill that increased the penalty for unlawful passing of a school bus, which was signed into law by Gov. Janet Mills. He said he is most proud of a bill he sponsored in the last session that reduces the risk of occupational cancer for fire investigators by getting them into a retirement system comparable to other first responders, allowing them to retire earlier.
Harrington has in the past focused on public safety issues, but says his focus will now be on the budget and economy as the state faces a projected $1.4 billion budget shortfall over the next three years from lost sales and income tax revenue. He is concerned that Medicaid expansion was passed without a sustainable funding source and believes legislators need to focus on prioritizing the most vulnerable Mainers, including those who are elderly or have disabilities.
"This year, the primary focus is getting Maine safely reopened and getting our economy going," he said. "This budget is going to be really tough and we're going to have to make tough calls. There are going to cuts or tax increases. Families can't afford tax increases."
Harrington has been in the minority party throughout his tenure in Augusta and says he has a proven himself to be a bipartisan legislator and problem solver.
"I have a proven track record of working across the aisle. During the last session, I passed three bills, which I couldn't do without working across the aisle," he said.
Kidder, 61, lives in Springvale and is a self-employed income tax preparer. She has been involved with the Maine Peoples Alliance for the past eight years and with the Maine Unitarian Universalist State Advocacy Network. She has lobbied in Augusta for social and economic justice issues, she said.
"I've been working on the outside fighting for social change, but it really should be done on the inside," she said. "I want to run to have a Legislature that's willing to work together to get the job done instead of making people do it by referendum."
Kidder said she has advocated for expanding access to MaineCare, increasing minimum wage and requiring earned paid time off.
"Healthcare is a human right. Nobody should have to go bankrupt because of a health issue," she said. "When it comes to minimum wage, anybody who works a 40-hour week should not need food stamps to get by. ... You should make enough money to live."
If elected, Kidder said she wants to work to expand access to affordable healthcare and to reduce the property tax burden by making sure revenue sharing for cities and towns is fully funded. She also supports replacing Central Maine Power with a consumer-owned utility, which she says would lower utility bills and put Maine in the position to expand broadband access across the state.
Kidder said that while she has not held public office previously, she is prepared to work hard and is familiar with the legislative process through her time advocating for bills.
Kidder's endorsements include Maine Youth for Climate Justice, Maine AFL-CIO, Maine Peoples Alliance, Renew New England and Maine Education Association.

Cumberland County still home to top case rates Leading the way in ZIP code data are parts of Portland, Falmouth and Westbrook.

Texto completo: Cumberland County continues to dominate the list of ZIP codes in Maine reporting the highest rates of COVID-19 infection, with a handful of towns in York and Androscoggin counties rounding out the top 10.
But as Maine experiences a worrying spike in coronavirus cases, public health officials are warning that new infections are occurring throughout the state, including in rural towns that previously had few to no cases.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has described the situation as "sustained, forceful and widespread community transmission" across the state.
New ZIP code-level data released this week by the Maine CDC show that, not surprisingly, some of Maine's most densely populated neighborhoods have the highest total COVID-19 cases since the virus's detection in Maine in mid-March. Lewiston's 04240 ZIP code has had the most total cases, with 453, followed by Portland's 04103 and 04101 ZIP codes with 383 and 324 cases, respectively. Those figures represent total cases to date, including individuals who have recovered from the disease.
ZIP codes in Westbrook, South Portland, Falmouth, Biddeford, Scarborough and Auburn round out the top 10 in total COVID-19 cases.
Examining the ZIP code data on a per capita basis produces similar results, but with a few midsized towns in York County - such as Alfred, Springvale and Sanford - jumping higher on the list because of outbreaks or community transmission. But it is impossible to calculate per capita rates for every town in the state because the Maine CDC has only released specific case numbers for 113 ZIP codes, plus an additional 115 areas that have had zero COVID-19 cases.
Case numbers for the remaining 168 ZIP codes are provided in ranges - between one to five cases, six to 19 cases, and 20 to 49 cases - because "exact case counts are suppressed in all ZIP codes with 5 or fewer cases or a population less than 2,000," the agency said.
The Portland ZIP code of 04101, which includes downtown, the East End and Bayside, has had the highest prevalence of the virus with one case occurring among every 58 residents. The area also had the highest prevalence in June when the Maine CDC first began releasing ZIP code-level data.
Taken together, the three ZIP codes in Maine's largest city - 04101, 04102 and 04013 - account for 938, or nearly 15 percent, of the state's 6,467 COVID-19 cases since March. But the virus is less prevalent among Portland's population on a per capita basis, affecting one person out of every 74 residents compared to one among every 67 Falmouth residents and one of every 71 Westbrook residents, based on the ZIP code data.
Cape Elizabeth had a rate of 1 case for every 96 residents while Lewiston stands at 1 case for every 82 residents.
The three York County towns in the top 10 have also been impacted by outbreaks since the summer, some of which were epidemiologically linked to an August wedding and reception roughly 200 miles away in Millinocket. Alfred, which experienced an outbreak at the York County Jail that sickened roughly 70 inmates or staff, had a rate of 1 case for every 84 residents, while Springvale and Sanford have rates of one case for every 100 and 101 residents of their ZIP codes, respectively.
Determining per capita rates for smaller towns - including some that have been impacted by outbreaks - is more difficult or imprecise because the Maine CDC does not report exact case numbers for ZIP codes with fewer than 2,000 residents.
For instance, in the rural Waldo County town of Brooks, at the center of a growing outbreak tied to a church, there have been between 20 and 49 COVID-19 cases in a ZIP code with just 1,727 residents. That means the lowest rate would be 1 case for every 86 residents of Brooks, but it could be as prevalent as occurring once for every 35 residents. The Penobscot County town of East Millinocket, which was impacted by the August outbreak tied to a wedding, had a similar range.
Shah, the Maine CDC director, urged Mainers against using ZIP code case numbers to make decisions about how vigilant to be regarding precautions against COVID-19.
"What we've seen in the past week, in the past month and certainly today is that the virus is in every single corner of the state - every ZIP code, every county," Shah said on Wednesday. "So while the ZIP code data are interesting and informative, they are not a tool for individuals to calculate the risk of engaging in certain activities. We should be going about our days as we have recommended for months, which is that the virus is everywhere around us."
After successfully avoiding the surges playing out in other states in recent months, Maine is now seeing some of the highest daily infection numbers since the pandemic began. On Wednesday, the state logged 76 additional cases followed by 80 more on Thursday and 103 on Friday. That increased the state's seven-day daily average of new cases to 67.9 on Friday, more than double the number from one month earlier and up from 34.9 a week ago.
Rural Somerset County accounted for 26 new cases in two days, a sharp increase in a county that had previously seen less than 150 cases in seven months.
"What's important and concerning in Somerset County is there is no new outbreak investigation in any facility in that county, let alone one that accounts for the increase of 26 cases in two days," Shah said during his Thursday briefing. "To put that differently, based on what we know right now, this is strong evidence of community transmission all throughout Somerset County."

Texto completo: Somerset, Waldo and Washington counties are now designated as "yellow" in the state's school reopening advisory system.
Maine added two counties Friday to its list of those where it recommends schools offer hybrid instruction amid the state’s surge in coronavirus case numbers.
The Department of Education designated Somerset and Washington counties as “yellow,” meaning they have an elevated risk of COVID-19 spread.
Hybrid instruction is recommended as a way of limiting the number of people in schools and classrooms at any one time.
Waldo County, which received a “yellow” designation last week, remains “yellow.” The 13 other counties are green.
The changes come as Maine reported its highest single-day tally of coronavirus cases on Friday, with 103 new infections recorded around the state. Over the past 30 days, there have been 128 cases reported among students and staff in Maine schools.
The largest outbreak at a school so far has been at the Community Regional Charter School in Skowhegan and Cornville, which has reported 18 cases, though school officials said last week that everyone affected has recovered.
Most schools in Maine are already operating in hybrid models, but the transition has not been easy, and it is further complicated at schools that have had to shift between instructional models in response to cases.
“I’ve never had a problem that I felt so frustrated with,” Calais School Department Superintendent Ronald Jenkins said. “We’re getting bombarded in so many directions with what’s right and a different version of what’s right.
“It’s very difficult for us and I think that’s true of every superintendent in the state. It’s hard and quite frankly, they don’t teach you that in superintendent school.”
The Washington County district already opted to move to fully remote learning for its students Wednesday, so Jenkins said the state’s yellow designation won’t change things much. “We’re already following CDC guidance for the red designation,” he said.
Washington County is the site of a 27-person outbreak at Second Baptist Church, and the county’s two-week, population-adjusted case rate is four times higher than it was last week.
Waldo County continues to have Maine’s highest per-county positivity rate at 3%, and a new case rate of 17.4%. No outbreaks have been identified in Waldo County or Washington County schools at this time.
The state’s color advisory system, which is run by the Department of Education in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services and Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, is meant as a recommendation. Final decisions on instructional models are left up to individual school districts.
When the state launched the system in July, it originally said the advisories would be updated on a two-week cycle. However, the data is continually reviewed and Department of Education spokeswoman Kelli Deveaux said Friday the timeline is not fixed and flexibility is necessary to ensure timely updates to schools.
While most of the state has been “green” since the start of the school year, meaning in-person instruction is allowed, most districts have opted for “yellow” models in order to adhere to the state’s required physical distance and safety guidelines. The DOE suggests that under a yellow model schools may want to take additional precautions such as suspending extracurricular activities and sports or limiting the number of people in buildings at one time.
Earlier this week the Maine Principals’ Association indefinitely delayed the winter sports season for schools around the state while the association works with stakeholders to develop COVID-19 safety protocols.
Mike Tracy, superintendent in Anson-based Regional School Unit 74, said he met Friday with other Somerset County superintendents, most of whom have districts that are already operating in a hybrid model.
“For us, the major change is the cancellation of extracurricular activities and an abrupt end to the fall sports season,” Tracy said.
RSU 74 was forced to delay the start of the school year in August after a student tested positive for the virus, but Tracy said he has been pleased by what appears to be a low transmission rate for the virus in schools around the state.
“I’m really proud to say from my understanding Maine schools have not been the transmitter of COVID-19,” Tracy said. “The community spread in other places where they’re not taking precautions are where we’re seeing the transmission.”
In Skowhegan-based School Administrative District 54 in Somerset County, Superintendent Jon Moody wrote in a letter to the community Friday that the new yellow designation means that until further notice all sports, competitions and after-school activities will no longer occur in person.
Because SAD 54 is already operating in a hybrid model, Moody said he did not anticipate further changes to instruction, other than a quarantine for some students and staff at Canaan Elementary School, where the CDC reported a probable case of the virus in a staff member Friday.
In Calais, Jenkins said his district is moving to remote learning through Nov. 30, although they will evaluate on a weekly basis to see whether it is possible to reintroduce any in-person learning. The district now has two positive cases among elementary school students and additional presumptive cases among staff.
He said the district was prepared for the move to remote learning. Earlier this year the district used coronavirus relief funds to purchase additional technology for students, and teachers and staff have had professional development. Delivery of breakfast and lunch to students who request meals will also continue, he said.
“We hate what’s happening, but we know what we have to do,” Jenkins said. “Our first priority is to keep students safe and faculty and everybody.
“We’re trying to do it. I guess only time will tell how well we’re doing, but I’d like to think we’re doing a good job and everyone will be fine.”

Texto completo: Two Saco residents are competing for an open seat in the Maine House representing District 14.
Lynn Copeland is a Democrat and two-term Saco city councilor who works as a legal assistant.
Theodore Sirois is a Republican who works as an equipment technician.
Here are their answers to questions on a series of issues.
Lynn Copeland
Maine's COVID-19 response: The overall response worked, as evidenced by the relatively low numbers. If there was more compliance and enforcement of mask wearing, the numbers of those affected could have been even lower.
State budget: Cut discretionary spending, increase revenue while protecting the needy. Entice businesses to Maine to broaden the tax base and create jobs. Local option sales tax for towns to target needs.
Pressing issue for young Mainers: The most pressing matter facing first-time voters is climate change. Immediate scientific action is required to combat this clear and present threat.
Political fighting: The stifling of progress by politicians is unfair to voters who expect them to do their job. I will listen to all views and speak truth with respect while working toward the best result.
Is there anything in particular that you hope to accomplish? As a therapeutic foster parent, I have seen many youths at risk. The foster care system needs more support and creative solutions.

Theodore Sirois
Are you satisfied with the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic? No. Restrictions on certain counties should have been lifted sooner allowing them to decide their own regulations. All elected officials should have been "critical employees" and continued working.
How to balance state budget: An across-the-board cut instituted on all departments then the Legislature should reconvene to restore funding to them on a one-on-one basis after all pandemic related obligations have been payed.
Most pressing matter for young Mainers: This generation of Mainers must break our century old cycle of leaving Maine for better economic opportunities elsewhere and focus on improving Maine's business climate to provide them jobs here.
Political fighting: Although I cannot control the actions of a PAC, if one attacks my political opponent with outright lies or exaggerations, I would immediately contact the press and disavow what has been said.
Is there anything in particular that you hope to accomplish? Get Augusta to help us deal with Saco's Camp Ellis beach erosion problem and get hundreds of students out of the rusty trailers at Young School because these issues have been ignored for too long.

Residents voice need for better downtown

Texto completo: About 40 people offer suggestions during a Zoom Community Conversation hosted by Hallowell organizations and the Maine Developmental Foundation.
HALLOWELL — Residents of Hallowell have their priorities: They want officials to improve the diversity of downtown businesses, improve infrastructure and enhance outdoor recreation.
Those were the topics raised Thursday night during a Zoom Community Conversation, organized by a group of Hallowell organizations seeking residents’ input.
Among those who ran the forum: The city’s Comprehensive Planning Group, Vision Hallowell, Hallowell’s Community Heart & Soul planning group, Hallowell All-Age Friendly Committee and the Hubbard Free Library.
After a short introduction, participants were divided into groups to discuss questions pertaining to short- and long-term goals for the city ahead of Election Day, which will see new city councilors and a new mayor elected.
During one of the group sessions, Judy Feinstein, a member of the city’s Planning Board, said she had heard some city residents want more diverse businesses on Water Street, aside from the places to get food and drink.
That sentiment was echoed by other residents, who said craft stores and other retailers would be welcome.
“There was a real strong feeling that people wanted a downtown that had more than a dozen places to pick from to have a beer and a burger, to put it nicely,” Feinstein said. “The question that comes into my mind is, ‘What else does downtown have to offer?’”
Ryan Gordon, a Greenville Street resident, said he would like the city’s downtown to be more “family friendly” and safer for pedestrians. He said he rarely travels downtown with his family because the heavy traffic makes it unsafe for pedestrians.
Gordon said that problem also expands into the residential areas of the city, where cars are also “zooming through.”
“It feels like a really dangerous place with traffic that feels too fast to bring a family there,” he said, advocating for better sidewalks, fewer cars and slower traffic through town. “The physical way people move about is very important.”
Matt Bear-Fowler, a Hallowell resident who said he uses a wheelchair to get around, said there are some businesses he and his family cannot patronize because they only have steps. He said that is another area where the city could improve.
“There’s just so much that does not meet Americans with Disabilities Act standards,” Bear-Fowler said. “It’s too bad because it excludes a lot of people.”
Resident Judith Graber said the city should also look into the effects of climate change, because Water Street’s proximity to the Kennebec River makes it prone to flooding. Further, she supported the pocket park concept at the corner of Water and Central streets, and the larger concept of adding more green space to the city’s downtown.
Related to “green” concerns and initiatives, Gordon said he is a member of Hallowell’s newly formed committee dealing with solar power, which has a goal of getting 80% of the city’s households on solar energy.
Other groups discussed an emphasis on buying locally and hosting more outdoor events as short-term strategies to bolster downtown Hallowell.
Other goals included continuing the Kennebec River Rail Trail through the city, and getting grants to clean the facades of downtown buildings.
For the long term, goals included affordable housing and better connecting Hallowell’s outer neighborhoods with downtown.
City Councilor George Lapointe, a candidate for mayor, said he was “pleased with the focus on making the Hallowell portion of the rail trail more user friendly, the discussion on multigenerational events to draw people to town and the mention of a structured approach to economic development in Hallowell.”
Lapointe’s opponent in the mayoral race, City Councilor Maureen AuCoin, who said she helped plan the event through work with both Comprehensive Planning Group and the Hallowell Heart & Soul project, said the forum echoed repeated calls for economic development and infrastructure maintenance in Hallowell.
She said she has already begun working on making the city more walkable.
“Recently, as the chair of the Highway Committee, I was successful in facilitating a plan for the city of Hallowell and DOT (Maine Department of Transportation) to address the need for a crosswalk near Stevens Commons,” she said. “This is a step towards the walkability and interconnectivity of neighborhoods that folks seem to be asking for.”

Texto completo: WATERVILLE — The Maine Children’s Home for Little Wanderers believes giving toys and games through its Christmas Program is important for teaching trust and building connectedness in Maine families. It also knows that many Maine families are in need of basic essentials, such as socks, underwear and warm clothing in all sizes. This is why its Christmas Program is about more than toys.
The home needs help to provide 1,700 Maine children with these items. It is currently only accepting new items for donation. Used donations may need to be thrown away because of the current health crisis.
Listed are some of the most needed items.
GIRLS: Pants sizes 18 months and 16; long-sleeve tops sizes 2T, 5, 7, 8, 16 and 18; socks sizes small, medium and large; underwear sizes 2T, 3T, 14, 16 and 18; fleece pullovers and hoodies sizes 2T through 12 girls; and fleece blankets.
BOYS: Outfits sizes 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10; pajamas sizes 10 and 12; pants sizes 18 months, 12, 14, 16 and 18 boys; underwear all sizes; and fleece pullovers and hoodies sizes 2T through 12 boys.
Items can be dropped off or shipped to: The Maine Children’s Home, 93 Silver St., Waterville, ME 04901. Be sure to mark the package — Attn: Christmas Program.
Items can be dropped off on the front porch of the Development Building (Building #3) on the MCH campus between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. Please fill out a donation card and leave it in your donation bag/box.
The children’s home often struggles to collect donations early on before the deadline, since boxes need to be completed by the first week of December. It’s never too late or too early to donate.
The Christmas Program is a year-long effort, and donations are gratefully welcome anytime. All items donated should be newly purchased and in original packaging free of dents, tears or dirt.
For more information, call 207-873-4253.

Texto completo: WATERVILLE — The Maine Children’s Home for Little Wanderers believes giving toys and games through its Christmas Program is important for teaching trust and building connectedness in Maine families. It also knows that many Maine families are in need of basic essentials, such as socks, underwear and warm clothing in all sizes. This is why its Christmas Program is about more than toys.
The home needs help to provide 1,700 Maine children with these items. It is currently only accepting new items for donation. Used donations may need to be thrown away because of the current health crisis.
Listed are some of the most needed items.
GIRLS: Pants sizes 18 months and 16; long-sleeve tops sizes 2T, 5, 7, 8, 16 and 18; socks sizes small, medium and large; underwear sizes 2T, 3T, 14, 16 and 18; fleece pullovers and hoodies sizes 2T through 12 girls; and fleece blankets.
BOYS: Outfits sizes 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10; pajamas sizes 10 and 12; pants sizes 18 months, 12, 14, 16 and 18 boys; underwear all sizes; and fleece pullovers and hoodies sizes 2T through 12 boys.
Items can be dropped off or shipped to: The Maine Children’s Home, 93 Silver St., Waterville, ME 04901. Be sure to mark the package — Attn: Christmas Program.
Items can be dropped off on the front porch of the Development Building (Building #3) on the MCH campus between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. Please fill out a donation card and leave it in your donation bag/box.
The children’s home often struggles to collect donations early on before the deadline, since boxes need to be completed by the first week of December. It’s never too late or too early to donate.
The Christmas Program is a year-long effort, and donations are gratefully welcome anytime. All items donated should be newly purchased and in original packaging free of dents, tears or dirt.
For more information, call 207-873-4253.

Texto completo: DAMARISCOTTA -- Before the start of the spring hunting season, Laurelai Winslow had a heartfelt talk with her dad. After years of Tim Winslow following his daughter on many of her successful hunts, she wanted to hunt alongside him, just as all hunting buddies do.
Tim Winslow shook his head and smiled when asked how he felt about his daughter's earnest request, like a man at a loss for words. Laurelai Winslow, you see, is 10.
Laurelai already has built a hunting resume that would take many a lifetime to achieve. Since she started hunting at age 6, Laurelai has shot five white-tailed deer, two black bears, a caribou in Alaska, and nearly a dozen wild turkeys.
The Winslows plan to be in the woods Saturday on opening day of Maine's annual firearm season for white-tailed deer, which this year includes a record of 110,000 any-deer permit holders. Maine residents begin the hunt on Saturday; non-residents can start on Monday. The firearm season runs through Nov. 28, and is followed by the muzzleloader season, which ends Dec. 5.
Laurelai has two bonus deer tags, which means she could harvest up to three deer this fall. Don't bet against her: Two years ago, at age 8, she shot two deer using a bonus tag - all in one day.
Any hunter in Maine can harvest a buck with a general hunting license. But with a bonus tag from the deer-permit lottery - which are mostly allotted along the coast where state biologists want to thin the deer herd - a hunter can also harvest an additional deer for every bonus tag they win, although the bonus deer must be an antlerless deer (such as a doe or a buck without antlers).
Laurelai remembers that hunt in 2018 vividly, how she was "drawing on my pad, doodling," in the hunting blind just after 6 a.m. when she looked up and saw "a big, big buck, with glowing antlers from the sun." She waited five minutes, until the 8-pointer turned broadside to make certain she had an ethical shot that would lead to a quick kill. Laurelai took that shot from 70 yards, without any instruction from her dad, and dropped the 185-pound buck.
Later that day when she stood in a family friend's field in Warren, she saw a smaller "button buck" (an antlerless buck) and from 150 yards, Laurelai dropped the second deer without hesitation.
"On a hunt, she decides when to shoot," said Tim Winslow, a Registered Maine Guide and carpenter. "And she decides when not to shoot. When she tells me she can make the shot, I know she can."
Youth hunters in Maine can start at any age, as long as they are accompanied by an adult with a valid hunting license. Laurelai first harvested a white-tailed deer at age 6 - a 120-pound doe she shot from 70 yards.
"It was the biggest and prettiest thing in the world. I was so tiny I had never seen a deer that big up close," said Laurelai, who hunted with her mother, Ali, that day. "(Dad) told me if the legs buck up, then you know you definitely hit it in the right place. I kept asking Mom after I shot, 'Did I hit it? Did I hit it?' And she kept saying, "Yup, you did.'"
Debbie Bocko, the Winslows former neighbor in Washington, met Laurelai four years ago when she asked Tim Winslow to teach her how to hunt. Laurelai ended up becoming a second mentor.
"I thought if this little 6-year-old can do it, I might be 64, but I can do it, too," said Bocko, a homesteader who raises livestock on her 80-acre farm. "I'm part Native American and all about self-sufficiency and sustainability. She understands the hunt from beginning to end. It's not about killing something. It's about going out and harvesting an animal and providing food. She can field dress an animal better than I can."
It's worth noting, Laurelai is the niece of the owner of the historic Libby Camps in the North Maine Woods, which date to 1880. But even Matt Libby, a Registered Maine Guide and float-plane pilot, thinks his niece's passion for hunting goes beyond her years.
"She is a rare breed, for sure," Libby said. "My kids have already talked with her and apparently Kayla, my 12-year-old, is planning to buy me out; Parker, my 10-year-old, will be chief pilot; and Laurelai will be the head guide."
At first glance, Laurelai Winslow appears to be a typical 10-year-old girl - and in many ways she is. She wears a big bow around her ponytail, has stuffed animals in her room and a chalkboard with artwork. She's colored her blond ponytail purple and blue to match that of her camo-clad Barbie, which Laurelai calls her "Hunting Barbie," a doll she's brought on hunts.
And Laurelai's other deep passion is cheering with her grade school team. During a recent interview at her home, with the mounted grouse she shot behind her, Laurelai executed handstands, splits and backbends as she answered questions.
"If it's a competition, then I like cheering better," Laurelai said. "But if it's just cheering practice, then hunting."
Ali and Tim Winslow, both avid hunters, first started taking their daughter along on bird and deer hunts when she was 18-months-old, outfitting her with ear protection and carrying her in a pack. They brought her to the shooting range at age 4 - making short trips to make it fun, but also to constantly work on safe gun handling skills and accuracy. She took to it, and became a crack shot like her mother.
"My dad told me when they taught me, 'You have to hit the target where you're supposed to. And when you can, I'll take you hunting,'" Laurelai said. "I really wanted to go. So I practiced a lot."
The Winslows taught Laurelai shot placement: where to always shoot an animal to assure a quick kill. With a life-sized plastic deer in their backyard, the Winslows still quiz Laurelai.
Bocko said her young friend's love of hunting is obvious. One time when she was turkey hunting in a blind with Tim and Laurelai and Bocko's scope stopped working, Laurelai passed her shotgun to Bocko and told her to use it instead. And one year when Bocko didn't harvest a deer on her farm, Laurelai gave her half the venison from her deer, to thank Bocko for letting her hunt there.
"She's very unselfish," Bocko said. "She has the skill, and she's good at it. But she's got that sense of responsibility and knowledge. She'll let deer go by rather than go out there and wound an animal. She's a strong young woman. And she's an inspiration for me, to see the next generation coming along."

Texto completo: I have reason to drive between Yarmouth and Portland every day. During the peak of the foliage season I was distressed to see so many out-of-state license plates, but figured the numbers would drop soon. Not so far.
One day last week I counted no fewer than 40 out-of-state plates from Exit 15 in Yarmouth to Tukey's Bridge, mostly from Massachusetts and New York, two states with much greater infection rates than we have. But now our numbers are skyrocketing, too. I can't be the only person who makes the connection between those coming here to escape the virus (and some bringing it with them), and our alarming increase in cases.
I call upon the governor to stop this constant flow with new, enforceable mandates to keep those who live here safe. We are rightly urged to forgo Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings. This goes down hard, however, when new sources of infection are allowed to come with impunity.

Vote for Biden to bring Americans together
During my lifetime, I've voted for candidates from both major parties.
Here are the questions I asked myself this year when considering which presidential candidate to vote for:
Will he represent everyone, not just those who elected him?
Will he consult experts and follow their advice?
Does he respect women, those with different abilities, people of color and individuals of varying gender identities?
Does he thoughtfully consider diversity of thought, religion and culture?
Does he have empathy?
Does he seek to serve the country rather than expect the country to serve him?
Does he take responsibility for his actions?
Is he a decent, trustworthy person? Most importantly, does he serve as a connector, rather than a divider?
I can answer these questions with "yes" for only one candidate: Democrat Joe Biden. He has my vote.

Bell will be thoughtful, caring state legislator
For a quarter-century, Art Bell has nourished his community with a breadth of generosity and skill seldom seen in just one person.
He's been a School Committee member for six years, youth mentor and coach, member of the Senior Housing board, treasurer of Yarmouth Cares About Neighbors, treasurer of the Library Board of Trustees - I'm sure I've omitted a few. It's fair to say that Art has given us much. He will bring the same thoughtful attentiveness to the unique concerns of Chebeague and Long Island, too.
I am pleased to support Democrat Art Bell for the Maine House of Representatives and know that he will serve us ably and well in Augusta.

Elect Rafferty to bring right values to Augusta
On Nov. 3, we choose who represents us in Augusta by voting for someone who shares our values. This year I'm proud to vote for Democrat Joe Rafferty, of Kennebunk, for Maine Senate. The main reason is how he treats everyone with dignity and respect.
I know this as a player for the JV baseball team in 1986 at Kennebunk High School when Joe Rafferty was coach. I know it working beside him at the high school for the last seven years, when he was the gym teacher and I was an ed tech helping special needs students through their day.
Joe was one teacher who would go out of his way to make sure that every student got the best high school experience they deserved. He has impacted and taught life lessons to hundreds of students and athletes in his many years as an educator and coach.
Let's send Joe Rafferty to Augusta.

Gan has the experience, skills needed for council
There are four candidates running for councilor-at-large in the Portland City Council election on Nov. 3. Of the four candidates, only Ron Gan has the pragmatism and social consciousness that our city needs right now.
Faced with a pandemic, a budget shortfall, a homelessness crisis and a housing shortage, Ron's land-use knowledge and his ideas about how we can make housing attainable while generating revenue are needed to help stop companies and citizens from leaving Portland to move to places like Rock Row in Westbrook, Brunswick Station and Biddeford Mill - all innovative mixed-use developments where housing is more available and businesses are welcome.
The City Council needs people with a passion for Portland and the skills appropriate for the crisis we are facing. I believe that Ron Gan is the only candidate for councilor-at-large who has these essential skills.

Pattershall will be an effective, moderate voice
As a relatively new Brunswick resident, I hesitate to weigh in on local elections, but I make an exception to enthusiastically support my friend Republican Brad Pattershall for the Maine Senate, where I recently served eight years myself.
I have known Brad and his family for many years. As a fellow attorney, I can tell you firsthand that Brad has all the qualities necessary to be a top-notch legislator - with integrity, an inquisitive mind and a willingness to consider all sides.
Brad is part of a vanishing breed of moderates. If you are looking for someone who will always vote with his party, Brad ain't your guy. I have no doubt he will quickly earn the trust and respect of his colleagues in Augusta, just as he has done so in the practice of law.
Whatever your political persuasion, I respectfully urge you to consider giving Brad your support.

Question C would be a bad new deal for affordable housing The ordinance would put at risk hundreds of units in the pipeline, rewrite the rules and ultimately worsen the crisis.

Texto completo: Portland is largely united in recognizing the urgent need for affordable housing. We simply don't have enough places where people can afford to live. The lack of affordable housing affects businesses and their ability to find and retain employees, Portland's general prosperity and livability, and perhaps most obviously, homelessness - something everyone wants to solve.
It is telling that the Maine Affordable Housing Coalition, which brings people together to cure Maine's affordable-housing crisis, was forced to take a stand against Question C, urging Portland voters to vote "no."
Although I expect there were good intentions, the issue with the referendum question is the lack of collaboration with affordable-housing experts. The same applies to Question D (the rent control referendum). Complex policies created in a vacuum without broad discussion and input are ripe grounds for unintended consequences.
Written without public input and without consultation with those of us involved in building affordable housing, Question C would devastate housing construction in Portland. Hundreds of affordable-housing units currently in the pipeline would be put at risk.
Worse still, the City Council could not correct things for five years.
It's clear that most Portland residents take climate change seriously and want the city to firmly act to reduce fossil fuel use and improve efficiency. Affordable-housing developers do, too, and they already adhere to smart-growth principles and energy-efficiency design standards.
But Question C actually sets a lower environmental standard for buildings over 50,000 square feet, while driving up the labor costs of construction on affordable housing, schools and other city projects. Projects over four stories would have to pay prevailing construction wages for the Boston market, something quite out of reach for Portland.
Calling Question C "A Green New Deal" was clever marketing, but the proposed ordinance doesn't focus on the environment, and the effort would do little to produce new, renewable energy.
It would, however, rewrite the rules for affordable housing and worsen Portland's housing crisis.
Here is how. Affordable housing requires the bulk of the costs of the housing development to be offset, accomplished primarily through tax credit financing. Once those costs have mostly gone away, rents can cover the pure operating costs of the property, including utilities, while building reserves for the long-term upkeep and proper maintenance of the building so it won't deteriorate. Without much amortizing debt service, rents can be kept low for the life of the project, often the next 99 years.
But the funding sources that make affordable-housing creation possible come with many strings. One of them is cost caps - the overall cost of the development must fit within an artificial limit set as one size for the entire state. Because building or land acquisition costs in Portland are extremely high, it is already nearly impossible to fit under those cost caps, and often it takes "value engineering": a synonym for eliminating desirable design features in favor of cheaper, less desirable (and less durable) ones. Question C overlays affordable housing with sudden, inflexible and expensive expectations, ones that will tip the balance and make the development impossible to do at all.
We need more housing of all kinds in Portland. Solving the lack of affordable housing is a tremendous challenge that we must all work together to fix.
Flawed policies will not help, and in this case, they will frankly stop us in our tracks.
If Question C passes, Portland will lose out in an intensely competitive process, and affordable and workforce housing will be pushed out of the city. People will live farther away from work and services, creating sprawl as development spreads out away from the city. This will disproportionately hurt Portland's most vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness who don't have cars.
We need more housing of all types for Portland to remain a city in which people can live, work and thrive. Housing is a social determinant of health. Our ability to keep people healthy and safe in Maine depends on our ability to expand affordable housing for people who need it, and they need it right here.
I support policies to advance smart growth, affordable housing and green building. And I'm voting "no" on Question C.

High schools suspend athletics

Texto completo: Skowhegan, Lawrence, MCI likely won't finish fall season after county receives yellow designation from Department of Education.
Maine Central Institute athletic director Jim Leonard couldn’t have been more blunt.
“We’re done,” Leonard said.
MCI suspended all athletics after the Department of Education designated Somerset County “yellow” on Friday, meaning there is an elevated risk of COVID-19 spread in the community. Washington and Waldo counties also received yellow designations.
Lawrence and Skowhegan also suspended athletics Friday, possibly bringing an end to their fall sports seasons.
The surge in coronavirus case numbers — the state reported 103 new infections Friday — raised some questions as to whether the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference cross country championship races would still be held Saturday in Waterville and Augusta.
The KVAC B race, which is scheduled at the quarry road trails in Waterville, will feature nine schools. Lawrence, Medomak Valley, Gardiner and Belfast will not compete at the KVAC B race because of COVID-19 concerns. Skowhegan is out of the KVAC A race in Augusta.
“We lost four schools in one week,” Oceanside athletic director Molly Bishop, the KVAC B cross country chairperson, said. “We are comfortable we can pull it off within all the guidelines. We can host this within the guidelines that were provided.”
Mike Bisson, a director at the Maine Principals’ Association, acknowledged there are some safety concerns with events that will attract student-athletes from several different communities. However, Bisson added the MPA would not step in and force a conference to cancel or postpone its championship meet.
“Everything is a concern when you bring kids together from different communities,” he said. “Now, cross country is a lower-risk activity. Hopefully, everything is OK. There are no easy answers.”
Lawrence cross country coach Tim Alberts said he had seven boys and five girls set to run in the KVAC B meet. At Thursday’s practice, Alberts noted the increasing number of COVID-19 cases statewide, particularly in Somerset County.
“I said ‘keep your fingers crossed that we don’t go into the yellow.’ They kind of knew this could be coming,” Alberts said. “I told Josiah Webber (who placed fourth at the KVAC meet last season), ‘This could be your state meet.’”
Leonard said he suspended four events at MCI: 7-on-7 football games against Foxcroft Academy and Bangor; a field hockey game against Cony; and a girls soccer game against Old Town.
“I almost got a full (fall) schedule in,” Leonard said.
The Skowhegan field hockey team had its game at nearby rival Messalonskee canceled Friday. Skowhegan coach Paula Doughty said she heard shortly after noon that the county’s yellow designation meant her team’s season was likely over.
Doughty was frustrated for her team.
“My kids have practiced all week in the rain,” she said. “This is so hard for the kids. My kids have said to me, this is the only thing that’s keeping them sane, participating in sports. This whole thing is awful… We’ll keep our fingers crossed and maybe we can make up these games at the end of next week.”

Drive-thru Thanksgiving Dinner pick up is scheduled in Waterville
WATERVILLE — The Alfond Youth & Community Center will provide free Thanksgiving dinners from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 21, in the center’s parking lot at 126 North St. The drive through event is open to everyone in the community. Simply drive up and tell one of the volunteers how many meals you want.
A total of 800 individually packaged meals will be handed out, according to a news release from the center.
Also, because of the support of Central Maine Motors, youth can take home Feast Fixings to Go, the ingredients for their families’ to cook a full Thanksgiving dinner, including the frozen turkey, on Thursday and Friday, Nov. 19 and 20.
Feast Fixings to Go will be available to AYCC’s after-school program youth in Waterville, Fairfield Community Center, and Regional School Unit 18’s Williams and Atkins.
In 2019, more than 800 full dinners were provided to community residents, including individuals from Sacred Heart Soup Kitchen, Families Matter, Mid-Maine Homeless Shelter, KVCAP North End Teen Center and AYCC After School Program, according to the release.
Because the average American family spends $50 on Thanksgiving dinner, donations are needed. A donation of​ $50 feeds 25 people at the drive through dinner, or two families’ dinner in a bag. A donation of​ $25 feeds 15 people at the drive through dinner, or one family’s dinner in a Bag.
To donate, visit alfondyouthcenter-ivsrq.formstack.com/forms/donations1_copy_4.
With the support of multiple community donors and volunteers the AYCC cooks more than 50 turkeys to serve 800 meals and hands out 150 Thanksgiving Turkey Dinners-in-a-bag for families in need.
For more information, contact the center at 207-873-0684 or visit clubaycc.org.

BUSINESS; GOP grows nervous about losing Senate; Democrats are favored to regain control of the upper chamber as Trump's popularity wanes.

Texto completo: Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst won her Senate seat and Republican Party stardom six years ago on a promise to go to Washington and "make 'em squeal," just like the pigs she castrated on her family farm growing up.
If anyone's squealing this year, it is Ernst and other Senate Republicans who are locked in neck-and-neck races against Democratic challengers in an unusually large number of states.
In places like Iowa, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia and Maine, Republicans are left hoping President Trump will defy the polls to win, carrying them along with him. Otherwise they'll need to capture enough of those rare voters who split their ballot to support Democrat Joe Biden for president and a Senate Republican.

Against those odds, Republicans are likely to lose control of the Senate next year, according to many political forecasters and polls. To seize the majority, Democrats would have to pick up three seats, or four if Trump is reelected.
Given how closely divided the Senate is, a 50-50 split is possible. And if Biden wins, Democrats could rely on a Vice President Kamala Harris to break any Senate ties.
But a Senate tie would almost certainly fuel deadlock, because Democrats would not be able to afford to lose even a single vote from their caucus.
The fate of Senate contests has grown increasingly reliant on the outcome of the presidential race over the last several presidential election years. In 2016, they fell into perfect alignment: Where Trump won, so did the Republican candidate; and the same with Hillary Clinton and Democrats. So far in 2020, polls suggest that trend could continue.
Senate Republicans "may be outperforming Trump in some of these places, but given the state of the polls, the match rate could very well be what causes Republicans to lose the Senate," said Kevin Madden, a longtime Republican advisor to presidential and congressional candidates.
In this starkly polarized environment, there is no upside for Senate Republicans to try to distance themselves from Trump now. They would risk losing the support of Trump's die-hard base in order to scoop up the few remaining undecided independents. And those independents can be fickle and unreliable voters, particularly compared with Trump loyalists.
Republicans who "are in competitive races realize that their fortunes are largely tied to the performance of the president," said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 2 Republican in the chamber. "That doesn't mean they can't win without him, but it certainly means their chances of winning are enhanced if he performs well."
Trump doesn't seem to see the correlation.
"I probably help some. I don't think I hurt anybody. But I don't view them as being tied together, I never did," Trump said recently in Arizona, where Sen. Martha McSally is one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents. "I could do fantastically well in this state and we could have a Senate candidate that does unbelievably badly."
In both Arizona and North Carolina, the Senate Republican incumbent is trailing Trump in the polls, meaning they would need the president to win by a handful of points in order to get any boost from his coattails, according to a Republican working on Senate races.
Democrats are widely expected to lose a seat in Alabama but pick one up in Colorado. They are favored to capture GOP-held seats in Arizona and to a smaller extent in Maine. Iowa and North Carolina are toss-ups. Further out of reach for Democrats are GOP strongholds like South Carolina, Montana, Kansas and Texas, which had appeared in polls to be slipping away from Republicans, but now party officials feel they have pulled them back. Two Republican-held seats in Georgia could go to runoffs if no candidate gets 50% of the vote next week.
For Republicans to have a path to keep the Senate, they would probably have to take Democratic-held seats in Michigan and Minnesota. While polls have tightened in both states, Democrats still have a lead outside the margin of error. The best Republicans can hope for is probably a 51-49 Senate, according to GOP officials.
The toss-up in Iowa has turned that race into one of the most expensive in the country. Whereas Ernst won by more than 8 percentage points in 2014 and Trump defeated Clinton by more than 9 just two years later, Trump's drag has made it a toss-up, strategists say.
"Certainly, Trump is running a much closer election in Iowa than in 2016," said a Republican official working on the race. "To the extent the partisanship in Iowa has narrowed in this cycle, it probably contributes to the fact that it's a tighter race than we had in '14, which was a wave Republican year."
The farmgirl, mom and combat military veteran won her seat in 2014 with a folksy conservativism that appealed to the GOP establishment as well as the tea party conservatives who had come to dominate the party four years earlier. In her first year in the Senate, she was given the high-profile assignment of delivering the Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union speech, and quickly became a member of Republican leadership.
In hopes of a second term, Ernst's camp is touting her work on ethanol -- important to Iowa farmers -- as well as her work on veterans issues and the USMCA, Trump's trade deal.
Republican strategists involved in the race but granted anonymity to speak freely cast blame on the more than $100 million they say Democrats have poured into the state to muddy Ernst's record -- they were on air early in 2020 -- and boost her Democratic opponent, Theresa Greenfield.
The campaign ads say Ernst went to Washington, lost her Iowa roots and never made 'em squeal -- a message that has resonated with some voters.
Toni Sumpter, a 60-year-old retired pharmacist who lives in a suburb of Des Moines, said she has "no major complaints" with Ernst, but Greenfield's interest in strengthening Social Security and preserving Obamacare earned her support. A traditionally but not exclusively Democratic voter who has already cast a ballot for Biden and Greenfield, Sumpter doesn't see any value in splitting her vote.
"It's important to me to have the Senate controlled by the Democratic Party. That's the only way you get anything done," she said.
As Republicans' fortunes have fallen among suburban women -- in Iowa as in the rest of the country -- they have risen in rural areas. In fact, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2018 gained on Ernst's margin in the most rural parts of the state in 2014, suggesting that Ernst could make up for the suburban losses in Iowa's expansive rural areas.
Greenfield's path lies in massive turnout in the urban and suburban parts of the state, and in convincing voters who backed Obama but flipped to Trump to come back to Democrats. Ernst's camp says that Greenfield would be beholden to the liberal agenda of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), such as the Green New Deal and "Medicare for all." Greenfield says she opposes those policies.
With Nov. 3 closing in, some Republicans have quietly taken up the argument that with Biden surging in the polls, Republicans should hold on to the Senate in order to keep a check on the Democratic House and White House.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the group that boosts Senate Republican candidates, has run an ad in Iowa questioning that possibility.
"What happens if they have all the power?" the ad says, with a picture of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), Schumer and Biden. "Stop the liberal nightmare."
A similar ad has run in Montana. In Maine, Sen. Susan Collins is touting her importance to the state "no matter who you're voting for for president."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) argued Friday that a GOP-led Senate would serve as a better check on a Biden administration. "The solution to this is 51 Republican senators," he said on the Hugh Hewitt show.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine - Ahmir Thompson, founder of The Roots and drummer for the "Tonight Show" band, wants to find the kind stranger who bought him a turntable and several records at the tender age of 5.
Thompson - better known as Questlove - posted on social media that he was traveling with his parents, who made their living playing gigs, when he made friends with "Ellie" in 1976 in Portland, Maine.
"Being the irresistible cat that I was, I talked an older woman named Ellie into buying me a stereo and a record collection," Questlove posted on Facebook and Instagram.
Ellie wrote the youngster's order on a napkin: "Bad Blood" by Neil Sedaka, "Dance With Me" by Rufus, and the Jackson 5.
"I knew talking to strangers was a no-no, but my instincts paid off," he wrote.
His parents were upset that he'd been chatting up a stranger when Ellie returned the next day bearing gifts. But he says his new friend told his parents "please don't have him get in trouble on my behalf!! He's so cute of course I wanted to start his record collection!!!"
Questlove was born into a musical family in Philadelphia. His father was Arthur Lee Andrews Thompson, a singer who was lead with Lee Andrews & the Hearts, a 1950s doo-wop group. His grandfather Beachy Thompson had sung with the gospel group, the Dixie Hummingbirds. Questlove's mother, Jacquelin Thompson, together with his father, was also part of the Philadelphia-based soul group Congress Alley.
Questlove attended the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. By the time he graduated, he had founded a band called the Square Roots (later dropping the word "square") with his friend Tariq Trotter (Black Thought). Questlove's classmates at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts included Boyz II Men, jazz bassist Christian McBride, jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, jazz organist Joey DeFrancesco and singer Amel Larrieux. After graduating from high school, he took jazz and composition classes at the Settlement Music School.

Hospital stresses importance of honest COVID-19 screening

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Screening for COVID-19 symptoms before anyone enters a facility is a key step in protecting the people who visit or work in that location. This is particularly vital at hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
"We know that our screening questions can seem a bit tedious or time consuming to people. As the pandemic has evolved, the list of symptoms has lengthened and people's patience and diligence have seemed to shorten," said Julie Tutt, manager of infection prevention at Northern Light AR Gould Hospital.
"This makes for a bad combination, and we are seeing more and more people who declare they have no symptoms at our screening stations, but once they get to their provider's office, they raise health concerns that include some of these very symptoms," Tutt said.
There may be multiple reasons for this, according to Tutt. Sometimes people are just in a hurry and are trying to get to their appointment on time, so they are trying to rush the process without actually paying attention to the symptoms. Others may be concerned that if they admit they have a symptom that they won't get into their appointment.
"While many may think it is no big deal to disregard the symptoms check during the screening process, it really is a big deal," stresses Tutt. "We understand that often someone's medical condition may lead to that person having some of the COVID-19-like symptoms. Having symptoms won't keep you from your appointment; however, it will allow us to triage and treat accordingly to keep that patient, other patients in the practice, and our staff as safe as possible."
As the area sees more positive COVID-19 cases in Aroostook County and enters the season for other respiratory disorders, it is important that people know what COVID-19 symptoms are so they can self-monitor. It is also essential that they answer screening questions honestly at any buildings they are entering that are screening, particularly the hospital and providers' offices.
Symptoms for COVID-19 now include: a new or worsening cough; a fever; chills; muscle pain; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; a sore throat; loss of taste or smell; nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; runny nose or congestion; headache; and fatigue.
"We encourage people to keep these symptoms in mind before they ever leave their home, whether it be for grocery shopping or to see their provider," Tutt said.
Healthcare workers are on the front lines in the battle of COVID-19. Numbers in Maine and throughout the country show how high the incidence of positive cases is for those in the healthcare field.
"If we don't accurately know a patient coming in to see us has COVID symptoms, we cannot be properly prepared. Yes, we have a mask and eye protection on for every patient we see, but for someone with symptoms, we may need further protection or to use a negative pressure room," said Renee Fournier, DO, a pediatrician at AR Gould.
"If a provider or other member of the care team gets sick, that means we are not available to treat patients for at least two weeks, meaning our practice can't see as many patients at a time when we are needed more than ever," Fournier said.
"We screen every single person who enters one of our facilities, whether that is an employee, a patient, a visitor, or a vendor, but that screening is only effective if people take the time to really consider the symptom list and whether or not any are applicable to them," said Tutt. "We know this works when done appropriately. We saw this first-hand with our employee who tested positive for COVID in July. Because this individual was screened out and tested so promptly, exposure was limited and no other employees or residents became positive."
Those with symptoms who are concerned that they could possibly have COVID-19 are encouraged to reach out to their primary care provider. People may also visit our website at www.northernlighthealth.org/testing to arrange a test. They should be sure to select the appropriate option, symptomatic or non-symptomatic, when making the request.

Healthcare workers are on the front lines in the battle of COVID-19. Numbers in Maine and throughout the country show how high the incidence of positive cases is for those in the healthcare field.
"If we don't accurately know a patient coming in to see us has COVID symptoms, we cannot be properly prepared. Yes, we have a mask and eye protection on for every patient we see, but for someone with symptoms, we may need further protection or to use a negative pressure room," said Renee Fournier, DO, a pediatrician at AR Gould.
"If a provider or other member of the care team gets sick, that means we are not available to treat patients for at least two weeks, meaning our practice can't see as many patients at a time when we are needed more than ever," Fournier said.
"We screen every single person who enters one of our facilities, whether that is an employee, a patient, a visitor, or a vendor, but that screening is only effective if people take the time to really consider the symptom list and whether or not any are applicable to them," said Tutt. "We know this works when done appropriately. We saw this first-hand with our employee who tested positive for COVID in July. Because this individual was screened out and tested so promptly, exposure was limited and no other employees or residents became positive."
Those with symptoms who are concerned that they could possibly have COVID-19 are encouraged to reach out to their primary care provider. People may also visit our website at www.northernlighthealth.org/testing to arrange a test. They should be sure to select the appropriate option, symptomatic or non-symptomatic, when making the request.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Screening for COVID-19 symptoms before anyone enters a facility is a key step in protecting the people who visit or work in that location. This is particularly vital at hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
"We know that our screening questions can seem a bit tedious or time consuming to people. As the pandemic has evolved, the list of symptoms has lengthened and people's patience and diligence have seemed to shorten," said Julie Tutt, manager of infection prevention at Northern Light AR Gould Hospital.
"This makes for a bad combination, and we are seeing more and more people who declare they have no symptoms at our screening stations, but once they get to their provider's office, they raise health concerns that include some of these very symptoms," Tutt said.
There may be multiple reasons for this, according to Tutt. Sometimes people are just in a hurry and are trying to get to their appointment on time, so they are trying to rush the process without actually paying attention to the symptoms. Others may be concerned that if they admit they have a symptom that they won't get into their appointment.
"While many may think it is no big deal to disregard the symptoms check during the screening process, it really is a big deal," stresses Tutt. "We understand that often someone's medical condition may lead to that person having some of the COVID-19-like symptoms. Having symptoms won't keep you from your appointment; however, it will allow us to triage and treat accordingly to keep that patient, other patients in the practice, and our staff as safe as possible."
As the area sees more positive COVID-19 cases in Aroostook County and enters the season for other respiratory disorders, it is important that people know what COVID-19 symptoms are so they can self-monitor. It is also essential that they answer screening questions honestly at any buildings they are entering that are screening, particularly the hospital and providers' offices.
Symptoms for COVID-19 now include: a new or worsening cough; a fever; chills; muscle pain; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; a sore throat; loss of taste or smell; nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; runny nose or congestion; headache; and fatigue.
"We encourage people to keep these symptoms in mind before they ever leave their home, whether it be for grocery shopping or to see their provider," Tutt said.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Aroostook County Action Program and MaineHousing on Nov. 1 reopened the COVID-19 Rental Relief Program for the months of October, November, and December for renters who cannot afford to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
The latest offering expands upon previous rent relief programs, run statewide by MaineHousing and administered locally by ACAP, allowing both previous and new applicants to apply for a maximum of $1,000 per month for October, November and December rent payments. One change in the program is that it now also covers people who live in MaineHousing-financed properties and do not have a Section 8 voucher or receive other governmental rental assistance.
"When we received additional funds allocated by Governor Mills in September, our projections showed that we would run out of money after issuing payments to help cover September rent," said Daniel Brennan, director of MaineHousing. "As it turns out, a number of initial applicants did not proceed through the full application, and we are glad we're able to extend help to more Mainers in need."
"This comes at a time when the need is great and, for some, growing," said Jason Parent, ACAP executive director/CEO. "We are headed into what many anticipate will be a long and difficult COVID winter. Many in our community, who are facing a prolonged economic impact from the effects of COVID-19, are worried as the temperatures drop and household expenses increase, while pre-COVID income has not returned."
Parent continued, "We are pleased to continue this critical partnership with MaineHousing to ensure residents of Aroostook County and across Maine have warm and safe places to live, and area landlords get their rental payments so the money can circulate back into our local economy when it is needed most."
Renters may apply for October and November by visiting mainehousing.org/covidrent or www.acap-me.org. Applications for December rent will be accepted beginning on Nov. 23. Applications are on a first-come, first-served basis and are managed in The County by ACAP, and by local Community Action Agencies in other part of the state.
Following a successful application, and appropriate communication and verification of program participation with the landlord, ACAP pays the property owner directly. Should there be any balance of payment, landlords agree to postpone it, not forgive it, when they agree to participate. The landlord also agrees not to evict for non-payment of rent for the month(s) for which the funds are applied.
"We want to be sure people know that even if they applied and received funds during other phases of this program, they can reapply now if they still need help paying their rent," Brennan added.
Additional eligibility requirements and information can be found at mainehousing.org/covidrent.
Since its creation in April, the COVID-19 Rental Relief Program has allowed ACAP the ability to process 789 payments to local landlords ensuring county residents remained safely in their homes during this pandemic.

Festival of Trees event canceled in Houlton

Texto completo: HOULTON, Maine -- The Christmas season may have a little less sparkle after the Health Services Foundation announced its popular Festival of Trees events could not be held this year.
Because of COVID-19, the annual tree auction will not take place at Houlton Regional Hospital, and attempts to make the fundraiser a virtual event were shut down by the state's gaming regulations.
"It is with great sadness and regret that the Health Services Foundation announces the cancellation of this year's Festival of Trees Event," said Lori Weston, executive director of the Foundation. "Many hours of brainstorming with community-minded members, running through every possible scenario to negate risks, investigating spaces and buildings that could adequately work, took place over the past several weeks before the difficult decision was made to cancel the event."
The joy of the holiday season begins early in the Foundation office, with calls from excited participants, describing their ideas and tree themes.
"It is contagious and this year, in particular, a welcome relief from all things COVID-related," Weston said. "The connections made during the Festival are ones that cannot be overstated. Many have described their time looking at the trees and listening to the quiet holiday music as just the thing to get into the holiday spirit and witness the thoughtful generosity of the tree donations."
Weston explained that because the Festival of Trees qualifies as a "Raffle-Game of Chance" in the state's opinion, a specific set of rules must be followed.
"While some raffles meet or fall below the $2,500 limit set for the value of the prize(s) won in a raffle, the need to apply for a gaming license is not needed," Weston explained. "However, the Festival of Trees is based on the combined value of all of the trees and their prizes and therefore a license was required."
Last year, the festival featured nearly 50 trees and raised a record $34,000 for the foundation.
Weston explained that the license application requires the applicant to state the location where the event will take place, details associated and takes up to 30 days to be issued.
"The combination of meeting the restrictions as outlined by the CDC with regard to social distancing, the number of people allowed in a given square footage space and the reality that any crowd gathering brings the risk of possible community spread made every aspect of trying to find the right space, as it turns out, nearly impossible," she said.
Initially, plans were put in motion to find a space outside of Houlton Regional Hospital for the trees to be displayed, and then to show them virtually through a website and social media. The group planned to sell the tickets online, but the State Gaming Commissioner said it was illegal to sell tickets virtually or by phone in Maine.
The "person to person" caveat of selling tickets brought its own set of issues. Possible sites for ticket outlets were investigated, but not having the visuals of the trees coupled with having to go to the ticket outlet to purchase tickets made it a complicated venture, officials said.
The Foundation conducted a random survey of people who have participated in the event in the past and found that the likelihood of making a trip to purchase a ticket was prohibitive.
"There has been a tremendous outpouring of ideas and suggestions from the community to try to bring this event to fruition," she said. "The fact that it has become a much-loved community event has never been more evident."
One suggestion was to reach out to local businesses and have the trees displayed in windows throughout the downtown. While that seemed like a good idea, the reality was each tree is often filled with a large number of pricey gift certificates and items.
"The security of the trees would be paramount and in places where there is limited staff and walk-in public traffic, it would be difficult to monitor the security of the trees," Weston said. "Outdoor options were even considered but security and the need for a steady group of around-the-clock volunteers would have been necessary."
Proceeds from the festival helped the local hospital, area clinics, municipalities and area schools by providing critically needed equipment, programs, technology upgrades and medical options that, in turn, meant better care.
"Our community is beyond amazing, caring and doing for a purpose greater than oneself and for a greater good," Weston said. "Sadness doesn't quite describe how it feels to cancel this event. Over the past few weeks, contact with like organizations and any options that they too have considered and that we might have missed, has connected the Foundation to incredible folks who, like the Foundation, will see their non-profit organization and their ability to help their organizations and communities hindered in a significant way.
"It is wonderful to hear that many are already making their plans for next year, or putting this year's tree to rest for a few months in anticipation of great things to come," she continued. "It is an indescribable feeling, making a heart that was feeling three sizes too small, to answer calls about making a donation to the Foundation in a year where it was beginning to feel like the Grinch had taken a bit of a foothold."

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Missed opportunities doomed the Maine Nordiques on Friday night against the Northeast Generals.
The power play wasn’t clicking as the Nordiques went 0-fo-4 in their 2-1 loss to the Generals in an NAHL junior hockey game at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee. The Generals didn’t have any opportunities on the man advantage.
The loss is the first at home for the Nordiques, who drop to 6-2 on the season.
“It’s a tough league to win in,” Nordiques coach Noah Howe said. “We put 47 shots on their goalie, but we didn’t do a good enough job creating traffic in front of him, making life hard. I thought we responded well in the third period, but we were much too casual for a period, period-and-a-half and it cost us.
“You know what, for our team, our aspirations and goals this season, adversity isn’t a bad thing. Learning some tough lessons early on in the season is important for us.”
Northeast (2-4-0, 4 points) was led by goaltender Hugo Haas, who made 46 saves in the victory.
“It was a good experience and we came out and pulled out a nice win, together as a team,” Haas said. “That’s what counts at the end.”
The Generals opened the scoring in the second period as they capitalized on a missed 2-on-1 chance by the Nordiques. After Hugo Haas made a save, the Generals skated down to their offensive zone, where JR. Perdion was able to jam the puck past Nordiques goalie Tyriq Outen (31 saves) five minutes into the second period.
Northeast continued to ride the momentum as Ricky Boysen stretched the lead to 2-0.
Maine had a chance to chip away at the deficit when Northeast’s Hunter Brackett was given a five-minute major and a game misconduct, but the Nordiques didn’t capitalize on the man advantage.
“It’s a scenario that we need to improve on,” Howe said. “We certainly have the right personnel, it’s just a matter of execution; once we get one, we will get hot and start scoring on the power play. That’s one area as a team that we need to do a better job on.”
Haas’ shutout bid came to an end midway through the third period when Nordiques’ defenseman James Philpott scored his second goal of the season. The goal was assisted by Aidan Connolly and Reese Farrell.
Shortly after the goal, the Nordiques went on the power play again, and once again couldn’t convert.
In the final minutes the Nordiques were unable set up a good scoring chance — they iced the puck and an inadvertent whistle stopped play in their defensive zone.
“It’s a tough game and the hockey gods for whatever reason wanted to make life difficult for us tonight,” Howe said. “We will learn from it and be better tomorrow.”
The teams meet again Saturday at 7 p.m. at the Colisee.
BELOV BACK WITH NORDIQUES
University of Connecticut commit Ignat Belov returned to the ice for the Nordiques on Friday. The 19-year-old from Minsk, Belarus, was in his home country for the start of the season because of coronavirus travel restrictions.
“It’s great having Belov back. He’s been here for almost two weeks now,” Howe said. “He got cleared by USA Hockey and we were excited to have him back in the lineup. He almost scored on his very first shift and created some opportunities. You see his speed and you see his strength, there’s a reason why he’s a Division I commit.”
Belov had four goals and three assists in 19 games for the Nordiques, whom he joined midway through the season after starting with the Tier I United States Hockey League teams the Cedar Rough Riders and the Sioux City Musketeers.
Also returning to the lineup for Maine was Cannon Green, who missed the past four games with an injury.

FARMINGTON — Franklin Memorial Hospital announced Friday that four members of its care team have tested positive for COVID-19.
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has classified the cases as an outbreak.
Medical leaders at the hospital are working with the Maine CDC to limit the spread of the outbreak. The four individuals who tested positive worked in different parts of the hospital and the hospital has initiated testing of anyone who could have potentially been exposed. The employees are in quarantine.
According to a statement released Friday by the hospital, the cases are not thought to pose a huge risk to patients because the staff has been consistent in using protective equipment that has been shown to minimize transmission of COVID-19.
However, medical leaders at the hospital worry the cases are a sign that COVID-19 is spreading extensively to Maine’s rural areas. Trampas Hutches, president of Franklin Community Health Care, said in the statement that it is important for members of the community to continue to wear a mask, social distance, practice good hand hygiene and to keep surfaces clean.
“Up to this point, Maine has done much better than the rest of the country controlling the spread of this virus, and fortunately for our community, it hasn’t been as prevalent in Franklin County,” Hutches said. “With the cooler weather, every indication is that that is starting to change. It is vital that we take this threat seriously by wearing a mask and practicing social distancing.”
Franklin Memorial Hospital is open for all services, and there are extensive protocols in place to keep patients safe, including universal masking in all facilities, frequent cleaning and designated areas for treating those who may have been infected with COVID-19.

State: CMMC failed to take precautions during COVID-19 outbreak

Texto completo: <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-20595422" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/CMMC.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="815" />
LEWISTON — Central Maine Medical Center allowed employees to walk through the hospital without masks, didn’t consistently or correctly screen workers and visitors entering the building, and failed to keep its Intensive Care Unit clean even as the hospital was dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak — an outbreak that started in the ICU — according to state investigators.
In a report issued in August and released this week to the Sun Journal, investigators said the hospital’s actions put people in immediate jeopardy, causing a situation in which a patient already had or likely could die or suffer serious injury. CMMC was ordered to quickly fix its problems, and hospital officials say they have.
CMMC’s COVID-19 outbreak began the third week of July and lasted well into August. In all, 17 people were infected, including 15 employees and two patients. According to the hospital, almost 50 people had to quarantine, most of them connected to the ICU.
The 32-page report details what CMMC did and didn’t do during that time:
• It did not implement all the infection control strategies it could have in order to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19, nor was it monitoring the strategies it did have;
• It did not keep the ICU clean. Investigators noted dirt build up, overflowing trash, a dirty towel on the floor, splatter stains and brown stains on the floor, and IV tubing touching the floor, among other sanitation issues. Some dirty areas were in the hallway, others were in rooms.
Investigators said they were told housekeeping staff did not clean any room that had a COVID-19 patient in it. Investigators also said the system director of infection prevention told them that she had not seen the condition of ICU, the unit where CMMC’s outbreak began;
• It did not screen everyone who entered the building, despite U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations to do so. Temperature taking and screening questions were haphazard for both employees and visitors and nonexistent at some entrances, even as the hospital was in the middle of an outbreak;
• It did not monitor all entrances or ensure that only employees used employee entrances;
• It did not stay up to date on U.S. CDC guidelines. Hospital leaders told investigators they thought a fever was anything over 100.4 degrees, but the latest CDC guidelines set a COVID-concerning fever at 100 degrees;
• It did not screen employees once they got to their units, despite what appeared to be a new hospital policy requiring it.
“We used to get screened before coming into the hospital, but now we wear a mask and if we don’t have any of the symptoms, we are good to work. It is an honor system for screening in the morning. There is no screening to come onto this unit or for the lab,” a phlebotomist told investigators;
• It did not adequately document what was going on;
• It did not have enough signs with instructions about face coverings and hand washing;
• It did allow at least some employees to screen just once in June and then forgo future screening.
“After that date (June 25), we had the employees sign an attestation form one time, electronically, and then the only thing they do daily when they come in is get a new mask, if they don’t have one, and complete hand hygiene,” the hospital’s regulatory compliance coordinator told investigators;
• It did allow some employees to enter the hospital and walk through the building without a mask.
When the investigation started, CMMC’s outbreak included 12 staff members and one patient. By the time the investigation was over, three more employees and one more patient had the virus.
John Alexander, chief medical officer for the health system, said CMMC immediately fixed the issues raised by investigators. The report acknowledged that CMMC officials quickly created a plan of correction and fixed the problems.
Those fixes include better screening for employees and visitors, as well as entrances that are restricted and monitored.
“We’ve really enhanced our processes to the point where we feel we have one of the best screening standards in the state,” he said.
Alexander said some of the issues within the ICU, such as cleanliness, were the result of the outbreak, which caused dozens of ICU workers to quarantine and miss work. Without those staff members, he said, some paperwork fell behind.
“It wasn’t so much that we weren’t maintaining the environment, it was more that we weren’t maintaining the documentation to support how we were maintaining the environment,” he said. “And that’s an important part of what we do.”
Alexander also said checklists weren’t being maintained, which meant employees coming on shift didn’t know what had or hadn’t been done by the previous shift. When asked why staff members couldn’t see on their own that trash needed to be emptied or the floor was dirty, Alexander said, “I can’t answer that.”
Alexander said the state investigators, who work on behalf of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, had been inspecting all Maine hospitals and arrived at CMMC as part of a routine screening. However, the report notes that investigators were there because a complaint had been filed against the hospital.
Alexander said he considers investigators to be good partners.
“We rely on them as another set of eyes to help us find areas where we may have opportunities for improvement,” he said. “We look forward to when those situations occur so that we can correct them and we can make sure we continue to work toward patient safety.”
CMMC has been the subject of a number of investigations in recent years, including last year when CMS investigators found a series of problems so serious that CMS threatened to stop paying for Medicare and Medicaid patients to go there. The hospital fixed those problems and did not lose payments.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — There were moments when the cross-town rivalry between Edward Little and Lewiston became intense — even in the final game of the touch football season.
But in the end, all Blue Devils coach Darren Hartley and Red Eddies skipper Dave Sterling wanted to talk about was how their teams remained together in a world turned upside-down by COVID-19.
Edward Little came out on top with an 18-6 victory on a clear but cold Friday night under the lights.
For Sterling, watching his athletes maintain their discipline and roll with the punches this season was most important to him.
“It was a lot of fun. It is great that Lewiston lets us come over and play,” Sterling said. “We just want a season. This is just single-touch football. A lot of these guys want to get into pads, play a game. It is tough to reel them back in. You’ve got to love the passion of these guys.
“We got 45 guys who stayed and practiced since July 6. To deny them an opportunity (to play tackle football) is so wrong. This is just a scrimmage. People are posting scores in the paper. That is giving credence that, ‘Oh, you’ve got a season.’ This not a season. These guys know that. Players are frustrated. They want a real season and they deserve it. We still have the lowest COVID numbers in the country.”
While touch football isn’t the same as a physical game complete with players wearing equipment, both teams’ desire to win was visible Friday.
After a scoreless first quarter, the Red Eddies struck first. Junior quarterback Jeff Keefe, who threw three TD passes, kept EL moving in the second quarter. He connected on three deep passes to seniors Devonte Scott, Tyson Green and freshman freshman Gavin Therriault to put the Eddies in striking distance. Keefe then tossed a TD pass to junior wide receiver Jason Brooker (two TDs). The conversion failed, but EL was the scoreboard first with a 6-0 lead.
The Blue Devils remained scoreless until the third quarter. Quarterback Matthew Dube threw three complete passes in a row to bring Lewiston to the 20-yard line. From there, Dube connected with Dalton Lajoie for a touchdown. The conversion failed, but the score was tied at 6-6.
“We have a come along way in just three weeks in the 7-on-7 game,” Hartley said. “Proud of our young guys tonight.
“Even though we had our opportunities to finish, I am really proud of the O-line group coming out in the second half and answering. It was really a positive moment. Like I said, I wish it ended a little bit different, but I am really proud of my seniors and where they helped bring our program.”
The Red Eddies put the game away in the fourth quarter. Keefe sent over his second TD pass to Brooker from the 3-yard line with 9:23 left in the fourth quarter. Zak Therriault then caught a touchdown pass from Keefe with 42 second left on the clock to cap the 18-6 win.
Edward Little senior lineman Ben Poland, who was sidelined with an injury, was proud of his team.
“Our boys did an amazing job,” Poland said. “I think we were amazing, especially on defense. We executed. We didn’t allow big plays. We did a good job.”

Democrats try to round up votes in Lewiston

LEWISTON – Democrats sought Friday to rally the faithful during the final days of a long, sometimes brutal campaign.
“The entire country is watching Maine right now,” said Sarah King, co-president of the Bates College Democrats, during a gathering in Kennedy Park with the party’s U.S. Senate contender, Sara Gideon of Freeport.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-20588579 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/20562317_SJ.CITralliesK.103120-2-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189" />
A couple of hours later, U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts, grandson of Robert Kennedy, told a Lewiston Democrats rally that “Maine has such an important role to play at every level” this year because it has close, contested races for the U.S. House, U.S. Senate and president.
“On Tuesday night,” Kennedy said, “the eyes of the nation are going to be” on the Pine Tree State.
Gideon told about 75 Bates College students to do their part.
“This is your country,” she said. “This is your time.”
Gideon is locked in a close race to try to unseat four-term U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, with control of the Senate potentially at stake as Democrats try to pick up a few seats so they can oust Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
Maine’s 2nd Congressional District has been a tough one for Democrats for several election cycles, but polls show U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Lewiston with a big lead as he seeks a second term versus GOP challenger Dale Crafts of Lisbon.
The presidential race features Democrat Joe Biden taking aim at President Donald Trump in a contest that Kennedy said “is not a test of character or vision” between the two men.
It is, he said, “a test for the rest for us” about what kind of country and what sort of future Americans want.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-20588576 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/20562317_SJ.CITralliesK.103120-1-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" />
Annie Clark, spokesperson for Collins, said her campaign is confident that Mainers will see through the “millions of dollars in false attack ads” and reelect “the person they’ve known for years who leads and delivers on the most pressing issues facing our country, but who still cares deeply about the individual problems facing every Maine family.”
“For Sen. Collins, the focus of this race has always been on the people of Maine and what she has and can still do for them,” Clark said.
Gideon said there are many important issues on the agenda, from coping with the climate crisis to restoring the nuclear deal with Iran that Trump abandoned.
“There is so much that is going wrong,” Gideon said.
But, she told the students, the election is “bigger and deeper” than what Trump and the GOP is doing.
“It is about our potential,” Gideon said, about the need “to be better and bigger we are today.”
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-20588588" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/20562317_SJ.CITralliesK.103120-3.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="876" />
At Simard-Payne Memorial Park, Lewiston City Council member Safiya Khalid told about 50 Democratic loyalists that Trump “has peddled hate and fear in a cynical attempt to divide us” from the moment he entered politics.
“He has made my family, and families like mine, a target for venom and violence, and made our country meaner, weaker, poorer, and sicker,” she said.
She hailed Kennedy for coming to a city that has long had ties to his family, all the way back to Robert Kennedy’s days as a student at Bates during World War II.
Diane Grandmaison, one of the local party’s stalwarts, recalled candidate John F. Kennedy’s preelection rally in 1960 at what was then called City Park.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-20594555" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/Lewiston-Sun-Journal-Nov7-1960-900x621-1.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="621" />
“We waited and waited” well into the night, she said, “and finally he came.”
Roland Hachey, another longtime Lewiston Democrat who helped with former U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy’s unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign, said he arrived early at the 1960 rally to make sure he could get a spot up front on the rope line.
It was “very cold” that night, but John Kennedy finally arrived in the middle of the night, with torches lighting the way for thousands of people who stuck around to see him.
Both were thrilled that another member of the Kennedy family accepted the party’s invitation to come and talk with them.
Kennedy said the nation is better than Trump.
He urged the crowd to support “another guy named Joe who’s a pretty decent guy.”

Texto completo: Camille DeSanto is an artist from Keymar.
“I always remember drawing and painting when I grew up. My mom called me doodle bug and carried crayons around for me. I ended up doing a lot of collages made from magazines,” she recalled.
When she was 9, DeSanto made her own greeting card using stamps and scrapbook paper. She sold the cards and donated the proceeds to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
When she was 13, DeSanto was drawn toward photography.
“I did not have a camera but I was seeing things in pictures. I saw things that I wanted to take pictures of. My first camera was from Walmart,” she said.
DeSanto got her first “real” camera her sophomore year of high school. She got a Cannon Rebel E3I. At first, she took photographs of her yard, flowers and pets.
“I did not take my first good photograph until I was 15” she said. “I took a photo of a wine glass at sunset. I was so excited that people liked my photograph that it encouraged me to do more.”
She began to take photographs of people that she describes as more journalistic or documentary in style. DeSanto was prioritizing the moment and what was in the camera frame. That became more important to her than the aesthetic of the photograph. As an example, “I took a picture of a man playing a guitar on the street. He had his guitar case laid open for tips. There was a dog laying in the case. So, she took a photo of the dog in the case,” DeSanto explained.
In high school, DeSanto took the yearbook class in her junior and senior years at Francis Scott Key. As a senior, she was editor and chief of the yearbook. She learned a lot working on the yearbook and grew as a photographer.
“I learned how to make people comfortable when taking their picture. Also, I learned how to approach people and get them to say yes to having their photograph taken,” she said.
The practice made her inherently better.
DeSanto went to Rockport, Maine to participate in a workshop at the Maine Media Workshops and College (maidmedia.edu). She took a two-week advanced photography program. Students have attended classes there for more than four decades and have come from 44 countries. Many successful photographers have studied there. The school offers photography, film and media courses. Well-known local photographer, author and retired McDaniel College professor Sue Bloom teaches at the college every year.
That program changed everything for DeSanto. She learned how to operate her camera fully manually. Before she just used it set on the automatic feature. She also learned how to edit in Photoshop.
“I learned different ways to see and compose pictures that are visually interesting. The rule of thirds was instilled in the photography class in high school. It means that you need to have everything on a 3 x 3 grid. It was a restrictive way of thinking. I learned that the photograph can be however you want it to be and you can loosen up,” DeSanto said.
Currently, DeSanto is majoring in photojournalism as a junior at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. She is studying to get a bachelor’s degree in fine arts and minoring in “Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship" (innovation.gwu.edu).
According to DeSanto, her photojournalism studio classes at GWU have been the most impactful in her artistic journey.
“I have learned how to make a narrative with pictures and how to tell a story. I also learned what elements you need to tell a story,” DeSanto said.
DeSanto created a book titled “Clinging to Keysville,” which is a photographic essay about life and the people in Keysville.
“I made sure that I presented a good understanding of what the area looked like,” she said. “The book opens with photographs of local landscapes that provide the context of where the people of Keysville live and work. Then the book focuses on the people living there. It is about life and death. It is about how people live in rural America. It shows what remains of rural American through Keysville.”
DeSanto reflected on her journey.
“I like meeting people though photography and telling their story," she said. "I can show people how interesting they are. People see themselves in a different light.”
Her goal is to work for a media outlet like a magazine or website. “I would also like to do freelancing. The industry is turning towards that,” she said.
Her website is CamileDeSanto.com.

Texto completo: Our soft and weak president Donald Trump: Too soft to stand up to our enemies around the globe, who work for his reelection so as to continue to toy with him. Too weak to stand up for our allies, who once counted on us and now pity us. Too soft for the grinding work of governing. Too weak to protect the nation from the coronavirus, to which his administration surrendered months ago, taking with it the strong economy he inherited.
At his best, he's an ineffectual fool to be flattered, handled, and managed by his advisers. Fearful of competence and expertise, he pushes them away. A draft-dodger, incapable of comprehending the sacrifices made by strong men, women, and families, he is unworthy of the military he nominally commands.
And at his worst? It's been a long four years, but we may not have seen it all yet. Could he accept defeat, put the best interests of our democracy above his pride and ego, and resist the urge to burn down the house? That would definitely take a strong leader. I wouldn't count on this president.

Weary of reading, and rereading, about Trump diehards Once again, Globe readers are treated to a prominent article focused on the Trump voter (“In small-town Maine, Trump's popularity proves durable,” Metro, Oct. 28). Too often we've been subjected to these looks at what many of us have long since stopped caring even slightly about. Trump supporters are proudly immune to facts and rational argument, despite the clear and very present damage his policies have caused. No news here.
More important, the story about Maine's Trump diehards was displayed on the Metro front alongside an article describing how Trump, against logic and evidence, is falsely telling his supporters that doctors are deliberately falsifying the number of deaths from COVID-19 (“Doctors, Trump tussle over tally”). Meanwhile, in the first section of the same edition, a news story reports that 20 “former US attorneys — all of them Republicans — called President Trump 'a threat to the rule of law in our country.' ”
That Trump diehards would disregard both of those other stories is irrelevant, and not of interest to many Globe readers. Enough already. There are other parts of our diverse society, such as first-time voters, far more worthy of coverage.

President's defamation of doctors marks another new low Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claims that doctors and medical institutions have been inflating COVID-19 cases for their own enrichment is rightfully meeting with a “surge of criticism” (“Doctors, Trump tussle over tally,” Metro, Oct. 28). The fact that the president could conceive of such a scheme speaks volumes about his own character. Heroic medical professionals and other front-line responders are risking their well-being daily to combat a crisis Trump himself has fueled with his lack of a meaningful, effective response. All he seems to care about is extending his unfortunate tenure in the White House. Shameful barely describes his actions.

Donald Trump continues to spin impossible conspiracy theories at his rallies. The newest one, in Wisconsin, targets doctors and hospitals, basically accusing them of being morally corrupt and fraudulent. This is outrageous and very dangerous. His defamatory insinuations that doctors are falsely claiming other types of deaths as COVID-related are reprehensible and unforgivable. They're also hypocritical, considering the five-star treatment he received at taxpayer expense for his own case of the coronavirus — treatment not offered to regular folks.
At a time when health care personnel are working grueling shifts with no end in sight, thanks to selfish, ignorant Americans, Trump decides it's good for his campaign to disrespect and further demoralize physicians and other staff, some of whom are understandably hanging on by a thread.
How much lower can the president go? Sadly, plenty.

'It's the planet, stupid' In the latest of a litany of political power plays, a Trump political appointee has demoted the chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Craig McLean, and installed two political appointees, both critical of climate science, in his place (“NOAA chief scientist removed,” Page A8, Oct. 28). This is grim news.
In 1992, James Carville, a strategist in the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, coined the term, “It's the economy, stupid.” In 2019, political cartoonist René Cattin put a new spin on the phrase with a cartoon of teen climate activist Greta Thunberg making a revision: “It's the planet, stupid.”
Climate is the number one issue on the ballot. Vote as if the future of our planet depends on you.

A deeper swamp The Trump administration continues to populate high positions in science-based agencies with political operatives who are ideologically opposed to the purposes of the agencies they control (“NOAA chief scientist removed”). The president who vowed to “drain the swamp” four years ago has done no such thing.
He's appointed numerous executives from Goldman Sachs to the Treasury and Federal Reserve. He's filled the Environmental Protection Agency with former lobbyists for the coal industry. His judiciary appointments pass muster with the Federalist Society, which is funded by right-wing foundations dedicated to deregulation and untrammeled markets.
He's finally gotten around to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, where a climate change skeptic from the Cato Institute has been installed as chief scientist. The Cato Institute was cofounded by Charles Koch, and he retains broad influence over the libertarian think tank.
For decades, Koch has orchestrated campaigns to suppress and discredit climate science so that his fossil fuel empire can prosper. Trump is Koch's useful idiot, gladly acceding to the subversion of government agencies that were created to protect the people. The swamp is deeper than ever.

Lifelong Republicans vote blue We are both lifelong Republicans who have voted for the Biden-Harris ticket as well as for the Democrats running for the US Senate and the House of Representatives in South Carolina.
Four years ago, our choice was the Libertarian ticket of Gary Johnson and Bill Weld. This time the choice is even more obvious. Donald Trump is unfit to remain as president, and Joe Biden is totally qualified to be the leader of the free world.
The difference between the two presidential candidates is so clear that we did not agonize over the decision. And we made our choices for Congress to right the wrongs of the past four years.

Reelect Susan Collins
I recently cast my absentee ballot for Sen. Susan Collins. It was an easy choice. She is a moderate, hard-working, sensible person who advocates for all Maine people.
Do people remember that day in July of 2017 when the Senate was about to strike down Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act)? As I have family members with pre-existing conditions, I closely watched that vote, as insurance coverage is critical for them as well as thousands of other Mainers. Fortunately for all of us, Collins was one of only three Republicans who bucked President Donald Trump and protected Obamacare.
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has helped sustain a quarter million Maine jobs during the coronavirus pandemic. Collins didn't just vote for the bill that created this program, she co-wrote it. The PPP has supported working Mainers to protect their paychecks and their jobs as a result of the disruptions caused by the coronavirus.
I too am a moderate Republican and may even disagree with Collins from time to time. While it doesn't happen often, when it does, I know she is making her decision based on a thorough examination of the issues and is not anyone's puppet.
Collins has worked tirelessly for her constituents, Maine, and our country for over two decades. She has worked across party lines to get the job done. Join me in reelecting her so that her strong and thoughtful voice will continue in the Senate.

Margarita Contreni for House
It's time for northern Piscataquis to change our representation in Augusta and elect a person with experience revitalizing our local communities. Margarita Contreni has worked with business people and officials on the Moosehead Lake Region Economic Council, spearheading efforts to revitalize Greenville, including leading the effort to raise funds and plan for a waterfront park with public docks in downtown Greenville to draw in more visitors and business. She brought artists and business people together to help create the artisan village in Greenville that has brought visitors and revenues.
Contreni supports all efforts to develop a four-season resort at Big Moose Mountain near Greenville, a game changer toward achieving our goal to create a 12-month vibrant economy for our region. She also knows that our economic success depends on reasonable clean environment policies, including protecting the quality of our rivers and lakes.
Our current representative in the State House of Representatives voted against bills to ensure occasional inspections of old waste water disposal systems. Contreni enjoys getting out and talking to people -- she is a bridge builder who will work to get Augusta to pay more attention to our communities here in northern Piscataquis. Her opponent voted against a faster increase of tax revenue sharing between Augusta and the counties. By contrast, Contreni knows that getting Augusta to help empower local people is the best way forward. That requires a personable but insistent fighter for northern Piscataquis.
She'll fight for us in Augusta starting next year but first vote for her in November!

Why I'm voting for Sara Gideon
Recently, I was fortunate to be part of a health care round table in Caribou with Sara Gideon. As a pre-Medicare Mainer faced with health insurance premiums approaching $2,000 a month, health care is an important issue for me personally and professionally. My patients struggle with the cost of health care, the cost of medications, the cost of insurance and access to health care. Our office spends hours identifying which medication their particular insurance covers, the cheapest pharmacy, pharmaceutical sponsored indigent programs, who gets free samples and prescription coupons. Mainers are "clipping coupons" to fund their prescription medication. Gideon has begun to improve this.
Meanwhile, the health care bureaucracy has exploded with layers upon layers of intermediate insurance carriers, insurance clearinghouses, billing processing, health care claims adjusters, prior authorization personnel that then require providers to respond with more paperwork, documentation and staffing. Eliminating even half the layers could result in huge savings -- like enough money to cover health care for all without raising taxes. Gideon knows streamlining will only occur with legislative intervention.
Gideon understands that our health care crisis requires a national response, not a band aid approach. I think it is time to send a person to Washington with a fresh perspective. When the incumbent senator has had 24 years in office to fix health care, and hasn't, I believe it is time to give someone else an opportunity. I am voting for Sara Gideon.

Chose Clare Mundell for Bangor School Committee
Clare Mundell is the best candidate for one of the three seats on the ballot for Bangor School Committee.
Students in the Bangor School Department consistently demonstrate strong academic performance. The district's leadership team hires and trains highly-educated teachers who commit to ongoing continuing education and demonstrate a passion for their profession and compassion toward the students they serve.
Betsy Webb's retirement places the Bangor School Committee with its most critical decision in the past decade: an appointment of the next superintendent prepared to maintain the academic standards while providing an environment that promotes the emotional, social and mental well-being of all children in our community.
A well-rounded group of experts on the school committee is critical for all students in Bangor to thrive. Among the members, we must hold at least one seat for someone committed to equity and promoting students' mental health. Maine children's anxiety rates are the highest in the nation, and childhood depression ranks third in the country. Maine's adolescent suicide rate has increased by 50 percent since 2008 and ranks among the nation's highest. African American and American Indian and Native youth attempted suicide at twice the rate of white youth.
Mundell is a licensed psychologist who will advocate for Bangor students to ensure they have access to mental health, nursing and counseling staff. She will advocate for every child so they feel connected to their school, and no one falls through the cracks due to mental health needs, disability or membership to an underrepresented group.

Aaron M. Frey is Maine's attorney general. Matt Dunlap is the secretary of state.
We come from small towns in Maine. Born and raised in the communities of Dixmont and Town Hill, we both learned commitment to our neighbors and devotion to democracy from hardworking farmers, woods workers, fishermen, and the businessmen and working families that surrounded us. That background informs our shared commitment to protecting the fundamental right that allows citizens to register their voices: the right to vote.
This year, the election process has been obscured by doubt. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world, our first task was determining how to run the primary election during a global pandemic. Also, the campaign season has brought out the rumors, suspicious innuendoes and accusations of tilting the mechanisms of voting to benefit one candidate or campaign or another. Social media has proven itself incapable of controlling the spread of political misinformation, of preventing bullying and intimidation and of holding those responsible accountable.
As the keepers of the election process and the enforcement of Maine law, we are here to assure the people of Maine of our complete commitment to the simple goal of ensuring that every eligible American citizen who wishes to will be able to participate in the Nov. 3 general election, with the confidence that their ballot will be counted accurately, that the process will have complete integrity and transparency and that they can be a part of this process without fear of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We know now that foreign actors spread lies online during the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, encouraging us to attack each other -- and in pitting Americans against Americans, they tried to goad us into voting our fears instead of our hopes. Mainers should reject these attempts to divide us, and seek out respected, independent sources when determining how to vote in these critical elections.
As constitutional officers, we encourage people who receive confusing information about the upcoming election to turn away from social media and other unofficial sources of information, and instead turn to a trusted source: your local and state election officials, who are entrusted with providing timely and accurate information to voters.
Most importantly, voters should make a plan to ensure their voice is heard in this election. If you requested an absentee ballot and have not yet returned it, please do so as soon as possible, and no later than 8 p.m. on Election Day, to your municipal clerk. And if you plan to vote in person this Election Day, be sure to allow extra time this year, as the heavy turnout along with the social distancing and hygiene measures are expected to increase wait times.
Candidates are making their final pushes for support this weekend and, in places like Bangor and Old Town, and in Town Hill and Dixmont, proud Americans are debating the issues and discussing the candidates, as they prepare to vote for the hope of a brighter future. We'll be here to support them.

Yankee ingenuity will get America through the pandemic

Peter Vigue is chair of The Cianbro Cos. Timothy Templet is executive vice president of global sales at Puritan Medical Products LLC.
Doom and gloom. Since March, Americans have been subjected to pessimistic proclamations about small-business catastrophe and government ineptitude -- not to mention a COVID-19 pandemic that "may never go away."
Of course, there is some justification for the pessimism. American small businesses are indeed struggling to respond to a coronavirus that caught the federal, state and local government off-guard -- not just in the United States, but around the world. Hundreds of thousands of American lives have been lost, while anxiety and depression are on the rise. For public health reasons and economic ones, 2020 has been a year of immeasurable tragedy.
But we must stay optimistic. It is precisely during our darkest moments that we need to remain positive, and search for the light.
Good news is not in short supply. With the U.S. economy reopening, entrepreneurship is on the rise. Economic growth is skyrocketing, while unemployment continues to tick down.
At the same time, medical innovators are closer than ever to producing a vaccine that will protect millions of Americans from the coronavirus. Next month, Pfizer and Moderna are expected to report preliminary vaccine results. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a COVID-19 vaccine should be released by the end of the year.
In the face of unprecedented adversity, America is showing unprecedented resolve. But it's even more than that: Americans are exhibiting the very best of Yankee ingenuity, the same "can-do" attitude that transformed 13 British colonies into the world's foremost superpower. Sociologist Max Weber called it the "Protestant ethic," the bedrock of American capitalism. French diplomat Alexis de Tocqueville used the phrase "productive industry."
True to our name, we must keep soldiering on -- employers and employees alike. Economist Victor Hwang recently argued that "entrepreneurship is the vaccine for urban economies." And he's right, but rural economics are just as important. We need to promote entrepreneurship anywhere and everywhere -- from New York City and Los Angeles to America's most remote corners.
In fact, Yankee ingenuity is alive and well in rural communities, such as our home state of Maine. With the help of Cianbro, Puritan Medical Products was recently enlisted by the Trump administration to manufacture 90 million flock-tip swabs per month in the fight against the coronavirus. As the country's leading manufacturer of COVID-19 swabs, Puritan is now employing 800 workers in Guilford and Pittsfield -- two Maine towns with a combined population of under 10,000 people.
Think about it: Rural Maine is now the national epicenter of COVID-19 swab production, which may save millions of American lives in the months to come. If that isn't a testament to Yankee ingenuity, then what is?
Of course, the private sector cannot be alone in this fight, and we are not alone. Through the Defense Production Act, the federal government ordered its first COVID-19 swabs in April, while providing us with the resources needed to keep producing more. With the coronavirus stubbornly sticking around, our elected officials must continue to support businesses large and small -- not just with talk, but with action. The executive branch will play an important role, but cities and states can follow suit by enacting pro-business policies.
But, most importantly, Americans must keep calm and carry on. As entrepreneurs ourselves, we urge the business community to confront adversity with a "can-do" attitude -- now more than ever. And we ask the federal, state, and local government to support that entrepreneurial spirit every step of the way.
When the coronavirus knocks us down, we need to get up and punch back together.

Resumen: At the Class 3A Hoffman Estates sectional, you’ll need to find a spot along the outfield wall of the baseball field so you can get a clear vision of the final sprint in this race. Jacobs could be right in the hunt. *At Whitney Young, they will be running like gazelles which should be perfect since this course is right by the Lincoln Park Zoo. St. Viator, Brother Rice and St. Francis could also contend. *At Lakes, the team race appears to be wide open.

Texto completo: It won’t be Detweiller Park in Peoria, but when the boys cross country sectionals step off on Saturday, runners will still be seeking a sense of accomplishment.
The season was nearly canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then teams were able to race under strict guidelines with just regionals for the postseason. The IHSA then extended the season by one week, adding sectionals to the mix and giving teams statewide something a bit greater to aim for.
Expect longer meets than regionals since there are 15 teams and 15 extra runners at each sectional. That should mean five flights with the top runners going in the first two flights.
At the Class 3A Hoffman Estates sectional, you’ll need to find a spot along the outfield wall of the baseball field so you can get a clear vision of the final sprint in this race. It was epic last week at the Hoffman Estates regional last week and could be again on Saturday.
The regional individual title was decided by one-one hundredths of a second with Evanston’s Essay Tolossa (15:24.55) holding off Rolling Meadows’ Stephen Barretto (15:24.56). Now add in Lake Zurich’s Jacob Myers (15:21.92), New Trier’s Nick Falk (15;22.99), Warren’s Luke Wiley (15:26.31) and Lake Zurich’s Jack Gilboy (15:29.81) and get the camera ready for a possible photo finish.
The team title is equally up for grabs. Regional winners Libertyville, New Trier and Prospect will face tough challenges from Barrington, Warren and Lake Zurich.
*At Lyons, the Lake Park regional results hold the key to determining the favorites.
Defending Class 3A state champion St. Charles East won that regional and has the only three sub 15-minute runners in the sectional. The Saints were led by Micah Wilson (14:42.5), Luke Schildmeyer (14:53.9) and Zack Loomis (14:54.0).
Maine South, Jacobs, York, Wheaton Warrenville South and Lyons will be right behind.
Maine South’s Matt Coyle (15:09.0), St. Charles North’s Noah Eng (15:14.5), Jacobs’ Andrew Doetsch, Glenbard West’s Pierce Cousins, York’s Mickey Vreeland and Ethan Summer, Wheaton South’s Michael Atkins, Batavia’s Ryan Mansour and Lyons’ Owen Hays will also be in contention.
Team depth as the battle for fourth and fifth runners will be the key in deciding a sectional team champion. Jacobs could be right in the hunt.
*At Whitney Young, they will be running like gazelles which should be perfect since this course is right by the Lincoln Park Zoo.
Downers Grove South’s Tim Neumann (14:50.27) and Hinsdale Central’s Daniel Watcke (14:54.84), who were 1-2 at the Marist regional last week, will renew their rivalry here. Neuqua Valley’s Nicolas Dovalovsky (15:02.0), who was the regional champ at Oswego, along with Naperville Central’s Arthur Graham (15:09.8), Naperville North’s Julian Head (15:22.1) and Neuqua’s Aidan Stone (15:27.3) will also contend.
They will all get a nice challenge from the Chicago Public League’s top runners. Jones’ Aaron Hou (15:25.67) and Andy Niser (15:31.63) are just two of the runners that were sub-16 minutes in the Whitney Young regional.
Downers Grove South looks to be the favorite with Hinsdale Central, Naperville North, Neuqua Valley, Waubonsie Valley, Naperville Central and Jones also in contention.
*In Class 2A, the Chicago Latin sectional will be held in Lincoln Park. St. Viator, which had not competed for two weeks due to a COVID outbreak at the school, came back and won the Mather regional. The Lions were led by Michael Schumacher (15:29.8), who posted the fastest time of the three regionals. He will be joined by Connor Flynn, Nathan Kochera and Lucas Doland.
Hinsdale South’s Julian Watson (16:00.2) was also a regional winner.
Benet, which won the St. Francis regional, figures to be the team to beat here. The Redwings are led by Niklas Anderson, Dominic Ullmer, Ryan Amidei, Emmett Tully and Jack Robinson.
St. Viator, Brother Rice and St. Francis could also contend.
*At Lakes, the team race appears to be wide open. Regional winners Crystal Lake Central, Kaneland and Grayslake Central will be challenged by Vernon Hills, Lakes, Burlington Central and Hampshire could all contend.
Grayslake Central’s Bryan Vale, who was a regional winner along with Crystal Lake Central’s Karson Hollander Hampshire’s Isai Morales, Kaneland’s Isaiah Dallal all could contend for the individual title. They will be chasing Marian Central Catholic’s Peter Walsdorf, who had the top sectional time with 15:13.73.
*In Class 1A, at Harvest Christian the host Lions, who won their regional, look to repeat as sectional champs. They are coming off a decisive win at their regional where Matthew Olech (16:37.27) and Daniel Winkleman (16:43.35) were 1-2.
Aurora Central Catholic, Wheaton Academy and Montini also have top teams in the sectional.

Inside the Counties That Will Help Decide the 2020 Election; Demographic and economic shifts in several areas are shaping the election

Texto completo: The Wall Street Journal has visited counties across the country in search of trends that will influence the vote in November. These stories uncovered voters' local concerns, and they show how demographic and economic shifts are shaping this election.

Pandemic, Protests and the Economy Are on Voters' Minds in Key Counties
Between the pandemic, protests and a recession, a lot has happened since this project started, so we checked in with these counties to see how Americans are thinking about the presidential race and what issues they cared most about this year.

Growth, Coronavirus Move Election Debate in Conservative Colorado County
Colorado isn't a major presidential battleground this year, but the state could help determine control of the Senate. This swath of sprawling subdivisions and patches of farmland has long been a Republican stronghold, and they expect to win the county this year. Still, Democrats hope a variety of factors mean they can improve their performance there.

Older Voters in Florida Could Be Key to the 2020 Election
President Trump won Lee County by about 20 percentage points in 2016, helping him narrowly win the critical swing state of Florida and its 29 electoral votes. The county is a Republican stronghold, where more than one in three voters is aged 65 and older and many have roots in conservative parts of the Midwest. The president is expected to win there again, but in a state where the race is close, his margin of victory in places like Lee County could matter.

The Door-to-Door Election Battle to Swing an Arizona County
Whoever wins here in Maricopa County, home to Mesa, Phoenix and more than half of Arizona's residents, is likely to win the state—and potentially determine control of the Senate and whether President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden will occupy the White House. The election could hinge on turnout among Latinos, who make up about a third of the county's population.

Trump's Turn-Out-the-Base Strategy Is Tested in Maine County
Of the 67 counties in the New England states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, none gave Mr. Trump a higher margin of victory in the last election than Piscataquis County, Maine. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden doesn't come up much in conversations with residents of any political persuasion. The county serves as a proving ground for a Trump campaign strategy of turning out as many strong supporters as possible.

Coronavirus Divides 2020 Bellwether County in Wisconsin: 'There Is No Grace Anymore'
Sauk County, in south-central Wisconsin, is divided almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans. Locals say the pandemic has exacerbated partisan tensions. Interviews here found almost no one is undecided about whom to vote for in November, so whether President Trump or Joe Biden wins the county will likely depend on which side is more motivated to vote.

Interviews with dozens of Michiganders in two counties separated by a road known locally as the dividing line between Black and white communities found the views of many residents converging on national events. In particular, many on both sides of 8 Mile Road expressed support for the recent protests against police brutality and racial injustice led by the Black Lives Matter movement.

How the Coronavirus Complicates Joe Biden's College Outreach
Youth voting could be key for Democrats in battleground states like North Carolina in November. But with many colleges and universities moving classes online and students practicing social distancing, his campaign faces challenges in boosting their turnout.
Coronavirus Weighs on Americans: 'I Don't Think There Is an Easy Answer '
The Wall Street Journal spoke to residents in three places across the country where reporters spent time earlier this year— Howard County , Iowa; Philadelphia and Peach County , Ga.—to find out how the coronavirus crisis is affecting their lives, jobs and political views.
The South Is Trump's to Lose. It Might Come Down to Rural Turnout
President Trump is expected to do well in rural America on Election Day. But Democrats have a shot in Georgia and North Carolina if they can appeal to rural Black voters in places like Peach County. The key to victory here isn't persuading the unconvinced, it's turning out the base.

Why Philadelphia Could Help Decide the 2020 Election
How the vote shakes out in swing-state cities will play a major role in November. These urban centers can be the tipping point for candidates—especially Democrats, who rely on a big Election Day turnout. Philadelphia is Exhibit A. The city has been a Democratic bastion for decades, but that doesn't mean the party can overlook it in the 2020 race. The challenge for Mr. Biden in these swing-state cities will be to unify a diverse electorate and rack up enough votes to outweigh Mr. Trump's strength in rural areas.
What the Biggest Swing County in Iowa Says About 2020
Both President Trump and former President Obama won big in Howard County, Iowa. The president won in 2016 partly because he ran up huge victories in small, heavily rural counties. While he is likely to win such areas again, margins could matter. If Democrats can keep him from racking up the kind of gains he did in places like Howard County in 2016, that could help determine whether he will again carry battleground states such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Texto completo: Maine is breaking new ground as the first state to use ranked-choice voting in a presidential race, putting the system under a spotlight in a national election complicated by the pandemic and other factors.
The voting method will also be used for Republican Sen. Susan Collins's competitive reelection contest. The outcome of the race between her and Democratic rival Sara Gideon will help decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
Maine's system lets voters pick candidates for national office in order of preference in races with at least three contenders. That applies this year, when the ballot includes five people running for president and three challengers vying to unseat Ms. Collins.
The ranked-choice process is like a runoff, except voters make all their decisions up front rather than in another election. The process is used in several U.S. cities, and some states use it in primaries.
The system requires the winner to reach 50% support. If no one does after an initial count, it triggers a tabulation process where distant-finishing candidates are eliminated and votes are applied to voters' backup options until someone reaches majority support.
Maine's use of ranked-choice voting is among a number of factors that could lead to a longer wait than usual for results in this year's election. A coronavirus-driven surge in mail ballots and states' varying rules for when they can be counted —an issue that has been subject to last-minute legal wrangling across the country —have also created the potential for delays in certifying the winners of races up and down the ballot. However, nonpartisan election experts and state and local officials have sought to reassure voters that any extra time needed to tally votes isn't on its own a cause for concern.
If there is no clear majority winner in Maine's ranked-choice system, the process can take up to two weeks to complete, according to the Maine secretary of state's office. That is because officials must collect ballots and counting-machine memory devices from nearly 500 towns and cities, then scan them into the same system for tabulation. The count itself takes just minutes.
Political observers say the ranked-choice process will likely be needed to determine the closely contested Senate race, and possibly in the presidential race as well, with an Electoral College vote in Maine considered up for grabs.
Maine is one of two states, along with Nebraska, that splits Electoral College votes. The candidate who wins Maine's statewide popular vote gets two votes, and then the other two are awarded to whoever wins each of Maine's two congressional districts. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report considers Maine's second district a tossup in the presidential race and the most competitive electoral contest in the state this year.
Control of the White House isn't seen as likely to hinge on this electoral vote, according to nonpartisan polling analysts' current models. But were it to do so, "I think that would be an extraordinary circumstance," Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, a Democrat, said. "I don't know if it's going to come down to that. But frankly, I think we're pretty well-equipped to manage it."
Proponents of ranked-choice voting say it ensures winners have majority support and prevents voters from having to worry whether backing a third-party contender might tip the race to a candidate they don't want to elect. Ballot measures in Massachusetts and Alaska this year are asking voters to decide whether to adopt the system.
This year's nine-way Democratic primary for a U.S. House seat in Massachusetts, which ended with the winner getting 22.4% of the vote in September, "is kind of the poster child for ranked-choice voting," said Evan Falchuk, who chairs the campaign to bring the process to the state.
Detractors, including Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, say the process adds unnecessary complication for voters and election officials.
Though political observers say ranked-choice voting generally shouldn't help or hurt either party, Maine Republicans have mounted multiple unsuccessful legal challenges against the process. The state party lost a U.S. House seat in a ranked-choice election two years ago.
This year's Senate race appears most likely headed toward a ranked-choice decision. A poll conducted by Colby College last week showed Ms. Gideon at 46.6% and Ms. Collins at 43.4%. Independents Lisa Savage and Max Linn had 4.7% and 1.7% support, respectively. The poll of 879 likely voters had a margin of error of 3.3%.
Ms. Savage's supporters were most likely to consider Ms. Gideon a backup option, suggesting some advantage for the Democratic contender.
Whether the presidential race will also hinge on ranked votes is less certain, because, in part, 9% of polled voters in Maine's second district were recently undecided, said Dan Shea, who chairs Colby's government department. The Colby poll showed former Vice President Joe Biden at 45%, Mr. Trump at 42% and three minor-party candidates collectively at 4%.
"It's a tougher call to say if it will go into overtime," Mr. Shea said.

Texto completo: Noble Partners is accused of keeping deposits after failing to fulfill orders for medical supplies.
A medical supply company started by a Portland man who was facing a five-count criminal indictment is now being sued in federal court over claims it failed to deliver a million antiseptic wipes and did not return a $108,000 deposit.
Noble Partners, which has been doing business as Noble Medical Supply since shortly after the coronavirus struck the United States, is headed by Sean C. Grady, a veteran of Maine’s cannabis industry who was facing criminal charges of securities fraud, theft by deception and selling securities without a license when his company started taking orders for N95 masks, COVID-19 tests and other items in critically short supply in the early days of the pandemic.
Grady and Noble Partners now also face accusations that they failed to return six-figure deposits for orders never delivered to customers in Florida and California, never paid commissions to a sales representative in Texas, and even failed to pay their website provider.
Noble had its websites taken down by its provider, which replaced them with a message saying the company owes it more than $15,000 and linking to news articles about Grady’s troubles.
“If you are the owner of this website, your account is seriously delinquent,” the message also says. “All other attempts to communicate with you regarding this matter have failed.” The site is registered to NameCheap Inc., a Los Angeles web hosting company; its CEO, Richard Kirkendall, did not respond to a reporter’s inquiry.
A third company, Media Reps of San Diego is accusing Noble of keeping its $100,000 deposit after failing to deliver an order of 35 million surgical gloves. Media Reps President and CEO Mark Bauman, who shared email conversations he had with Grady and Noble’s director of government relations, former Maine state legislator Diane Russell, said he intends to sue Noble for theft and breach of contract.
Grady agreed to an interview multiple times over last week but each time was unavailable or said he had to reschedule, citing a family health emergency. He stopped responding to text messages Monday. Russell referred questions to Grady.
Lezer Corp. filed a lawsuit Aug. 4 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that Noble Partners and Grady defrauded the company of its deposit on a May 10 order of 218,000 alcohol wipes, 95 percent of which it says were never delivered. Lezer, a medical distributor incorporated in Delaware with offices in Bay Harbor, Florida, claims it was “absolutely shocked” when Noble and Grady failed to deliver on May 18 as had been agreed.
“Grady was not even apologetic, and instead offered Lezer only stall tactics and false promises regarding shortly providing delivery,” Lezer says in its complaint. Grady ignored the company’s requests to return its deposit, leading Lezer to conclude that he was running “Noble and its affiliated business entities as mere fronts and alter-egos to advance his criminal fraud enterprise and hide his identity,” the company claims.
Court documents show Noble and Grady were issued a summons in early October but have failed to respond. A clerk’s default judgment against the defendants was posted Oct. 15 to the docket because of their apparent “failure to appear, answer, or otherwise plead” within the requisite time period.
“Technically they are in default, and technically the case should be over and we should be collecting,” Lezer’s attorney, Aharon S. Kaye of Skokie, Illinois, said in an interview. “But from a procedural standpoint they will have another opportunity to respond.”
Via text message, Grady declined to speak about the suit with a reporter, instead referring questions about it to one of his attorneys, Jeffrey Bennett of Legal-Ease LLP in South Portland. In an interview, Bennett asserted that Noble and Grady “haven’t received proper notice to be joined to the case” despite a summons having been issued to both Aug. 7.
“A summons is one in a series of steps for there to be proper notice,” Bennett said, adding that for various technical reasons the status of the case was not as it appeared.
Bennett also provided a completely different description of events: He said Noble was acting as a broker on a deal between Lezer and a supplier, and that Lezer had lost its claim to the deposit by trying to cut out the middle man and acquire the wipes directly from Noble’s source of supply. He said Noble might file its own suit against Lezer and the supplier.
Kaye, Lezer’s attorney on the case, expressed surprise at this version of events but declined to comment on the details of a case in active litigation.
Separately, the Press Herald was recently contacted by Bauman, the Media Reps president, who said Noble had failed to deliver a June 10 order of 2.5 million N95 respirators and failed to return the $100,000 deposit his company had made on them.
Bauman shared a long email chain and screenshots of text messages he had exchanged with Grady and other Noble Partners employees that documented his four-month effort to get the deposit returned, during which Grady repeatedly said the refund was being processed or that it had been issued.
“They said they will refund it and didn’t, and still they would claim it was issued,” Bauman told the Press Herald. “They were lying to me. It’s still not refunded — it’s just blatant fraud with these guys.”
By text message, Grady referred questions about Bauman’s accusations — and those made online by the web hosting service — to another lawyer, Stephean Chute of Cape Elizabeth, who did not return calls or respond to email messages.
In July, the Press Herald was contacted by one of Noble’s sales representatives, Rob Close of San Antonio, who said he was owed $4,000 in unpaid commissions and that he had stopped representing Noble after it delivered faulty surgical masks to one of his customers, University Hospital of San Antonio, which was then serving a community facing a dramatic explosion in COVID-19 cases.
A spokesperson for the hospital’s parent entity, Leni Kirkman of University Health System, confirmed via email that some of the masks — which were set out for visitors to wear inside the facility — “had holes in them or were falling apart.” She said the hospital had not paid for the masks upfront and that Noble did not appear to be seeking payment for the faulty products.
Grady first attracted attention in March when he started taking orders from municipalities, fire departments and hospitals in Massachusetts for N95 respirators, three-ply masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and other critical medical supplies that first responders and front-line health care workers were having trouble obtaining. His company, which had no experience in medical supplies, claimed to be able to secure hundreds of thousands of the coveted N95s and also offered to sell COVID-19 tests.
The Press Herald reported March 26 that Grady is facing a five-count criminal grand jury indictment in Cumberland County Superior Court on charges of securities fraud, theft by deception and selling securities without a license for incidents predating the pandemic. The indictment alleges Grady defrauded two investment clients, in one case by falsely representing that the funds would be invested in Noble Partners, and that the individual would be made chief technology officer of the company. He was originally scheduled to appear in court April 22, but the pandemic has postponed civil proceedings indefinitely.
Grady also has been permanently barred from being granted securities licenses and registration privileges in New Hampshire after he failed to respond to a November 2018 cease-and-desist order connected with one of the alleged frauds. Jeff Spills, deputy director of that state’s Bureau of Securities Regulation, told the Press Herald in March that Grady owed the state $238,471 in fines and restitution imposed in its summary administrative judgment against him, part of which was to compensate the alleged victim, an elderly woman from Charlestown, New Hampshire.
In the last days of March, Noble did deliver masks and respirators as promised to several Massachusetts hospitals and municipal first responders, an effort that required Diane Russell to drive to New York in a rented van to collect them in the middle of that city’s pandemic crisis.

Texto completo: As Maine sees some of its highest daily numbers for COVID-19 and local election officials are taking precautions to prevent the spread the virus on Election Day.
One in a frequent series of stories examining Maine’s election system.
Maine’s COVID-19 cases are surging just days before thousands of voters will head to polling places across the state to cast their in-person ballots in the Nov. 3 election.
Public health and election officials have been preparing for pandemic voting since March and steered voters through an unusual statewide primary that was held in July. That election, which chose party candidates in races for the U.S. House and Senate and the Maine Legislature, went off without producing any known COVID-19 infections.
But it is expected far more voters will head to the polls for next week’s general election, which features a presidential contest at the top of the ticket and one of the most costly and closely watched U.S. Senate races in state history.
Here’s what you need to know about what measures are being taken to protect you from COVID-19 on Election Day.

How different will my polling place look in 2020 compared to past elections? One of the biggest differences you will notice is there are going to be far fewer voting booths in your polling place than in years past. Based on guidance from state health officials, election clerks have been advised to ensure there is a minimum of 6 feet of spacing between all booths.
In a typical year, state law simply requires municipalities to provide at least one voting booth for every 200 registered voters.
State health officials are also requiring that voting booths be sanitized after each use. That means some booths may be temporarily closed until election clerks can clean them for the next voter.

How about the number of people in the polling place? The total number of people, including poll workers and poll watchers, will be capped at 50 in each room or enclosed area during any one period of time. So you may have to wait in line to vote.

What about that line? It could be long, as social distancing requirements will keep those standing in line 6 feet apart. Election officials have also been directed to mark out a 6-foot distance on the floor and in waiting areas to help those in line maintain adequate separation.

How about the election workers? One thing that may stand out is you will likely see a lot of new faces. Many longtime polling place workers, often retirees who are more likely to have serious complications from COVID-19, have opted out of this election. Fortunately a wave of new volunteers has stepped forward, but they may not be the familiar faces you are used to seeing when you go vote.
They will be required to wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including facial coverings, under the guidance of the Maine Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, aimed at protecting them and you from COVID-19.

Will I have to wear a facial covering to vote? This is a tricky one. An executive order by Gov. Janet Mills, which has the effect of law, requires you to wear a facial covering whenever you are in indoor public spaces or in outdoor spaces where adequate physical distancing can’t be achieved. You are strongly encouraged to adhere to this guidance and wear a face covering when you vote, but Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap has advised election officials that they cannot turn away a voter who has a constitutional right to vote if the person refuses to don a facial covering in the polling place or while waiting in line.

What if an election worker tests positive for COVID-19 either just before or after the election? Election officials say they will follow the procedures for quarantine, testing and contact tracing as directed by the Maine CDC. Officials also said that poll workers will be unlikely to have any interactions with you that are longer than 15 minutes and are being discouraged from any unnecessary socializing with voters.

Will candidates still be allowed to greet voters? Those running for office will still be allowed to visit polling places to greet you, but unless they are voting themselves will be required to remain outside. Candidates are advised to remain 6 feet apart from one another and from you, and not to shake hands. They are also required to wear facial coverings.

What about those gathering voter signatures for petitions? Signature gatherers will be required to wear facial coverings and must set up outside in a designated space that has been prearranged and preapproved by local election officials.

What about poll watchers, are they allowed inside? Yes. Election officials must provide space for at least one volunteer for each major political party, but they will be required to maintain 6 feet of separation, remain behind the established voting place guardrail and wear a facial covering. Poll watchers are not allowed to interfere with the voting or voter registration process.

What about the media? Representatives of the news media will be allowed inside the polling places as space allows. They must wear face coverings and maintain a 6 feet of distance from others and follow all the other polling place requirements, including that they may not record photographs or videos of actual ballots or interview you inside the polling place.

What else will be different in my polling place? Beyond the spacing of voting booths, foot traffic in the polling place will be organized to flow in one direction. You will also be given single-use pens to fill out your ballot, and you will be asked to either keep the pen or deposit it in a box when you leave the polling place. There will also be ample amounts of hand sanitizer, and its use is encouraged.
There will also be no bake sales or other non-political charitable events allowed inside the voting place.

But at least I’ll be able to get my, “I Voted Today” sticker when it’s all over, right?
Sadly, no. Election officials are being discouraged from passing out stickers in order to limit hand-to-hand contact or the creation of high-touch areas with boxes or bowls containing stickers.

Texto completo: The Maine Education Association says changes to health insurance plans were done without consultation with unions and against signed contracts between the system and retired employees.
Retired employees in the University of Maine System and the unions representing them are upping the pressure on system officials to reverse changes to health insurance plans they say were done in violation of union contracts and will hurt thousands of retirees.
About 50 people gathered Thursday in Portland outside the Pierce Atwood office of James Erwin, chairman of the system board of trustees, to protest the changes and call for the system to reinstate the previous health care plan. They wore masks and held signs that said things such as “My life is on the line” and “Don’t cut my healthcare!”
“The university system has decided to reward these people for their years of dedication by making changes to their health coverage that will negatively impact many of them now, in the middle of a pandemic, and on into the future,” said Grace Leavitt, president of the Maine Education Association.
The changes, which are planned to take affect by the end of the year, involve moving retirees’ insurance from a group plan to a health care exchange where they would be required to pay for medical expenses upfront and be reimbursed. About 3,000 people are impacted, including some spouses of retired employees.
The University of Maine System has said the change is expected to save about $2.5 million annually and that it will expand benefits and provide more flexibility.
“Chancellor (Dannel) Malloy and the University of Maine System Board of Trustees are committed to providing university retirees with supplemental health insurance on top of their Medicare coverage that is cost effective and delivers value and flexibility for plan participants,” said Dan Demeritt, a system spokesman, in a statement.
“With only 3,000 beneficiaries spread across the country with unique healthcare needs, a traditional group health plan with escalating costs and out-of-pocket expenses was no longer the best option for retirees or fiscally sustainable for the university system.”
Demeritt said the new plan will allow retirees and eligible spouses to enroll in supplemental medical and drug coverage through the Aon Retiree Health Exchange with coverage provided by more than 100 insurers. The system is providing health care reimbursement account contributions of up to $2,900 for a retiree and spouse to cover premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.
Nearly 400 people are already enrolled in plans and experts with Aon will have met with and helped answer questions for more than 2,300 people by the end of the week, Demeritt said.
Unions have said the change was done against contract agreements and retirees are already finding the change to be more expensive with higher out-of-pocket costs and less coverage. In a news release Thursday, MEA said it is considering legal action.
The Associated Faculties of the Universities of Maine and two other local unions representing system employees have filed grievances asserting that changes to the health care system are a mandatory subject of bargaining, meaning the system would have had to negotiate the change with the unions prior to implementation. The grievances also contend the change is in direct contrast to the existing union contracts.
Demeritt said the system’s labor relations team has been in ongoing discussions about how the transition will impact current employees when they retire.
“While the law does not require us to negotiate about our current retirees who are not members of our UMS labor unions, we’ve partnered with Aon to provide individual outreach and support to help every single retiree and their dependents make informed choices to enroll in new plans that provide greater flexibility and benefit options, usually at a significant cost savings to our retirees and their dependents,” he said.
Lorrayne Carroll, a professor of English and women and gender studies at the University of Southern Maine for the last 22 years, said she is putting off retiring because of the changes. Her partner, Joe Medley, is retired after close to 40 years teaching in the economics department.
“We both expected that the retirement benefits we were promised when we took our positions would be in place after so many years of service,” said Carroll, 66. She said the new Aon plan would result in increased costs, diminished coverage and fewer health care choices for her and Medley.
“We choose to work and remain working at USM in large part because the union benefits made that work possible and the retirement provisions were part of those promised benefits,” Carroll said.
“For the UMS system to radically reduce their contribution to our retirement benefits, to limit our health care choices and to make these changes without any notice to current and future stakeholders makes clear this decision is deeply flawed and it must be rescinded.”

Texto completo: Oct. 30, 1991: A hurricane later commemorated in Sebastian Junger’s best-selling book “The Perfect Storm” and a film of the same name reaches peak intensity off Canada’s Atlantic coast.
The then-unnamed storm began to grow Oct. 28, when it sank the Gloucester, Massachusetts-based fishing boat Andrea Gail, killing its six crew members.
Also known as “the Halloween storm,” the multiday event batters Maine and the rest of the Eastern Seaboard — especially Massachusetts, where 100 homes are destroyed or severely damaged. Damage is reported as far south as Jamaica and as far north as Newfoundland. At its Oct. 30 peak, the storm generates ocean waves from 40 to 80 feet.
In Maine, hundreds of homes are affected, most prominently the summer residence of then-President George H.W. Bush on Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport. The famous vacation residence, visited by several world leaders, sustains extensive damage when the wind and water knock out windows and flood the interior.
Waves of up to 25 feet plow ashore and smash into houses at Camp Ellis, part of Saco, and 20 families are evacuated.
In Kennebunkport, water 3 feet deep covers 1.5 miles of Beach Avenue and penetrates about 40 houses across the street. Police report high water reaching the first floor of about houses in Wells.
Twelve vulnerable houses in Cape Elizabeth are evacuated.
The tidal surge, propelled by 50-mph winds, is one of the 10 most severe in Maine’s history to that time.

Tips on staying safe at polling places

Texto completo: As Maine sees some of its highest daily numbers for COVID-19 and local election officials are taking precautions to prevent the spread the virus on Election Day.
One in a frequent series of stories examining Maine’s election system.
Maine’s COVID-19 cases are surging just days before thousands of voters will head to polling places across the state to cast their in-person ballots in the Nov. 3 election.
Public health and election officials have been preparing for pandemic voting since March and steered voters through an unusual statewide primary that was held in July. That election, which chose party candidates in races for the U.S. House and Senate and the Maine Legislature, went off without producing any known COVID-19 infections.
But it is expected far more voters will head to the polls for next week’s general election, which features a presidential contest at the top of the ticket and one of the most costly and closely watched U.S. Senate races in state history.
Here’s what you need to know about what measures are being taken to protect you from COVID-19 on Election Day.

How different will my polling place look in 2020 compared to past elections? One of the biggest differences you will notice is there are going to be far fewer voting booths in your polling place than in years past. Based on guidance from state health officials, election clerks have been advised to ensure there is a minimum of 6 feet of spacing between all booths.
In a typical year, state law simply requires municipalities to provide at least one voting booth for every 200 registered voters.
State health officials are also requiring that voting booths be sanitized after each use. That means some booths may be temporarily closed until election clerks can clean them for the next voter.

How about the number of people in the polling place? The total number of people, including poll workers and poll watchers, will be capped at 50 in each room or enclosed area during any one period of time. So you may have to wait in line to vote.

What about that line? It could be long, as social distancing requirements will keep those standing in line 6 feet apart. Election officials have also been directed to mark out a 6-foot distance on the floor and in waiting areas to help those in line maintain adequate separation.

How about the election workers? One thing that may stand out is you will likely see a lot of new faces. Many longtime polling place workers, often retirees who are more likely to have serious complications from COVID-19, have opted out of this election. Fortunately a wave of new volunteers has stepped forward, but they may not be the familiar faces you are used to seeing when you go vote.
They will be required to wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including facial coverings, under the guidance of the Maine Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, aimed at protecting them and you from COVID-19.

Will I have to wear a facial covering to vote? This is a tricky one. An executive order by Gov. Janet Mills, which has the effect of law, requires you to wear a facial covering whenever you are in indoor public spaces or in outdoor spaces where adequate physical distancing can’t be achieved. You are strongly encouraged to adhere to this guidance and wear a face covering when you vote, but Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap has advised election officials that they cannot turn away a voter who has a constitutional right to vote if the person refuses to don a facial covering in the polling place or while waiting in line.

What if an election worker tests positive for COVID-19 either just before or after the election? Election officials say they will follow the procedures for quarantine, testing and contact tracing as directed by the Maine CDC. Officials also said that poll workers will be unlikely to have any interactions with you that are longer than 15 minutes and are being discouraged from any unnecessary socializing with voters.

Will candidates still be allowed to greet voters? Those running for office will still be allowed to visit polling places to greet you, but unless they are voting themselves will be required to remain outside. Candidates are advised to remain 6 feet apart from one another and from you, and not to shake hands. They are also required to wear facial coverings.

What about those gathering voter signatures for petitions? Signature gatherers will be required to wear facial coverings and must set up outside in a designated space that has been prearranged and preapproved by local election officials.

What about poll watchers, are they allowed inside? Yes. Election officials must provide space for at least one volunteer for each major political party, but they will be required to maintain 6 feet of separation, remain behind the established voting place guardrail and wear a facial covering. Poll watchers are not allowed to interfere with the voting or voter registration process.

What about the media? Representatives of the news media will be allowed inside the polling places as space allows. They must wear face coverings and maintain a 6 feet of distance from others and follow all the other polling place requirements, including that they may not record photographs or videos of actual ballots or interview you inside the polling place.

What else will be different in my polling place? Beyond the spacing of voting booths, foot traffic in the polling place will be organized to flow in one direction. You will also be given single-use pens to fill out your ballot, and you will be asked to either keep the pen or deposit it in a box when you leave the polling place. There will also be ample amounts of hand sanitizer, and its use is encouraged.
There will also be no bake sales or other non-political charitable events allowed inside the voting place.

But at least I’ll be able to get my, “I Voted Today” sticker when it’s all over, right?
Sadly, no. Election officials are being discouraged from passing out stickers in order to limit hand-to-hand contact or the creation of high-touch areas with boxes or bowls containing stickers.

Texto completo: A total of two positive and four probable cases have been reported this week at Gardiner Area High School, and a total of 156 people from the school are under quarantine until the end next week.
GARDINER — There are now two positive and four probable COVID-19 cases at Gardiner Area High School, according to Maine School Administrative District 11 officials.
MSAD 11 Superintendent Pat Hopkins sent an update letter late Wednesday night. In addition to the COVID-19 cases that have been reported, 129 high school students and 27 on staff at the high school are under quarantine through either Nov 5. or Nov. 6, according to Hopkins.
Hopkins said everyone who has been in close contact with the individuals has been contacted, but it remained unclear Thursday if the cases involve teachers or students.
“With the support of the CDC (Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention), and school district nurses and administrations are actively contact tracing to identify students and staff members who have been in close contact with the two individuals that tested positive for COVID, and the four individuals who are currently probable positive,” Hopkins wrote.
Close contact for a student is defined as “anyone that has been in a classroom with another person for more than 15 minutes that has been confirmed as COVID positive or probable positive,” according to information Hopkins attached to the bottom of the letter to help families better understand the process.
After being in close contact, the individual must quarantine for 14 days from the date of possible exposure.
On Monday, the district reported a probable positive case, followed by a Tuesday report of two positive cases.
Gardiner Area High School is hosting Election Day next Tuesday, and the gymnasium area will undergo extensive cleaning and sanitation, according to Town Manager Alisha Ballard.
Maine is seeing the biggest spike in coronavirus cases since late May. The state reported 87 new cases Tuesday and another 80 Wednesday.
In her letter, Hopkins reminded students and staff members to practice social distancing, wear masks and maintain good hygiene.
The high school will continue operating in a “red” learning model through Nov. 6, meaning students will have all of their classes conducted virtually.

DRESDEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL There is also contact tracing underway at Dresden Elementary School after one positive COVID-19 test was reported Wednesday, according to Regional School Unit 2 Superintendent Tonya Arnold.
Arnold addressed the situation in a letter Wednesday, noting no other person is impacted by the case.
Dresden Elementary School will undergo extensive cleaning and sanitation.
Students will be learning fully remote through Nov. 6. Previously, they were learning under a hybrid model.
The school is part of RSU 2, which two weeks ago had another school, Monmouth Memorial School, report a positive COVID-19 case.
Arnold said no other school in RSU 2 has been impacted by this latest case.
“These situations are stressful for everyone, but especially for those closest to the situation,” Arnold wrote. “Please be supportive and protect the privacy of others, and demonstrate the RSU community compassion that makes us strong.”

Texto completo: The Channel 6 newscaster is retiring from his more than 30-year career to work as a personal trainer.
Longtime TV news reporter and anchor Lee Nelson, who grew up in TV studios as the son of a news anchor, will end a long career in the news business Friday when he retires from News Center Maine.
“It’s a little surreal, having spent my entire adult life doing one thing to now be doing something else,” Nelson, 58, said Thursday in a telephone interview.
“But at the same time, I feel fine. I am not rethinking it. My father was 52 when he died, and he had some unfilled goals and plans, and I hear that so often. People wait to retire and then they are not healthy enough to do what they want to do. I am healthy and I want to do something else. I have accomplished everything I can (in TV news), and now I would like to accomplish some other things.”
His new career is in fitness. Nelson, a self-described gym rat since his teens and certified personal trainer since 2010, will work with clients at Foley’s Fitness Center in Scarborough.
Nelson’s father was a news anchor in Maine, Boston and New York. TV news was an unlikely career for Nelson, despite his father’s success in the business. He grew up with what he calls “quite a substantial stammer” and had to learn to conquer it before he flourished in front of a camera.
“I don’t know that I have fully conquered it yet, but I certainly have conquered it on the air. When I am really tired and really stressed, it comes out,” he said.
Nelson started his career in broadcasting in 1985 when he got a job as a page at NBC in New York giving studio tours and seating audiences for “Saturday Night Live” and other shows. He has been with WCSH since 1990, when he began hosting the News Center Maine “Morning Report.” He remained on the morning show for one month shy of 30 years, before switching to the evening news in 2019. Friday night’s broadcast will be his last.
Nelson is married to his co-anchor, Cindy Williams. They met while working together in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, his first on-air job. This week on WCSH’s news magazine show “207,” he said he had few regrets, other than waiting so long to join his wife side-by-side on the evening news. “Should have done that earlier,” Nelson said.
They live in Biddeford, where they recently relocated from Falmouth in an effort to downsize, and have two sons in their 20s.
They worked together at the NBC affiliate in Hattiesburg for 14 months, before moving to New England. “I wanted to stick around with her, but I didn’t want to stick around Hattiesburg,” said Nelson, a Lewiston native. She got a job in New Hampshire and he picked up freelance work in Boston, before they both ended up in Portland.
Writing on the News Center Maine website, “207” co-host Rob Caldwell said he would miss his longtime colleague. “Lee has been a friend of mine for more than 30 years, and I’ll miss seeing him in the newsroom, talking about what’s happening across the street or around the world, swapping gossip, cracking jokes,” Caldwell wrote. “But I admire his enthusiasm as he leaves behind the only professional life he’s known as an adult and heads down new roads. As I’ve had to say too many times over the years when colleagues depart: Good for him, bad for us.”
Nelson began his career in TV after his father died, so his father never saw him on the air or knew of his interest in broadcasting. He said his father would be “flabbergasted” to know that his son spent more than 30 years delivering the news to audiences in Maine. “My life has been kind of written by him in a lot of ways. I have tried to do the things he had done and enjoyed and tried to avoid the things that didn’t work out for him,” he said.
His mother, who lived in Maine, died three years ago.
Nelson’s father jumped around in his career, from Maine to Boston to New York, in pursuit of better jobs in bigger markets. That movement created stress for the family and was something that Nelson wanted to avoid when he committed to a career in broadcasting. Once they found something they liked in Maine, Nelson and Williams decided to settle and raise a family. “We were really comfortable at Channel 6. It was a great place to work, and it made sense to stay.”
He said he would miss interacting with viewers and co-workers, and said the best part of the job was connecting with people across Maine. He said he made his decision to leave the news business last winter, before the pandemic, and acknowledged that now is a turbulent, tumultuous time for news reporters. In a parting message, he urged viewers to treat the news seriously and dismissed any notion that the news is fake.
“It’s really frustrating there are so many people out there who think we make up the news,” Nelson said. “It’s crazy. But it’s there. That didn’t used to be the case, until four or five years ago. Then all of sudden people were thinking we’re not telling the truth.”

Texto completo: Noble Partners is accused of keeping deposits after failing to fulfill orders for medical supplies.
A medical supply company started by a Portland man who was facing a five-count criminal indictment is now being sued in federal court over claims it failed to deliver a million antiseptic wipes and did not return a $108,000 deposit.
Noble Partners, which has been doing business as Noble Medical Supply since shortly after the coronavirus struck the United States, is headed by Sean C. Grady, a veteran of Maine’s cannabis industry who was facing criminal charges of securities fraud, theft by deception and selling securities without a license when his company started taking orders for N95 masks, COVID-19 tests and other items in critically short supply in the early days of the pandemic.
Grady and Noble Partners now also face accusations that they failed to return six-figure deposits for orders never delivered to customers in Florida and California, never paid commissions to a sales representative in Texas, and even failed to pay their website provider.
Noble had its websites taken down by its provider, which replaced them with a message saying the company owes it more than $15,000 and linking to news articles about Grady’s troubles.
“If you are the owner of this website, your account is seriously delinquent,” the message also says. “All other attempts to communicate with you regarding this matter have failed.” The site is registered to NameCheap Inc., a Los Angeles web hosting company; its CEO, Richard Kirkendall, did not respond to a reporter’s inquiry.
A third company, Media Reps of San Diego is accusing Noble of keeping its $100,000 deposit after failing to deliver an order of 35 million surgical gloves. Media Reps President and CEO Mark Bauman, who shared email conversations he had with Grady and Noble’s director of government relations, former Maine state legislator Diane Russell, said he intends to sue Noble for theft and breach of contract.
Grady agreed to an interview multiple times over last week but each time was unavailable or said he had to reschedule, citing a family health emergency. He stopped responding to text messages Monday. Russell referred questions to Grady.
Lezer Corp. filed a lawsuit Aug. 4 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that Noble Partners and Grady defrauded the company of its deposit on a May 10 order of 218,000 alcohol wipes, 95 percent of which it says were never delivered. Lezer, a medical distributor incorporated in Delaware with offices in Bay Harbor, Florida, claims it was “absolutely shocked” when Noble and Grady failed to deliver on May 18 as had been agreed.
“Grady was not even apologetic, and instead offered Lezer only stall tactics and false promises regarding shortly providing delivery,” Lezer says in its complaint. Grady ignored the company’s requests to return its deposit, leading Lezer to conclude that he was running “Noble and its affiliated business entities as mere fronts and alter-egos to advance his criminal fraud enterprise and hide his identity,” the company claims.
Court documents show Noble and Grady were issued a summons in early October but have failed to respond. A clerk’s default judgment against the defendants was posted Oct. 15 to the docket because of their apparent “failure to appear, answer, or otherwise plead” within the requisite time period.
“Technically they are in default, and technically the case should be over and we should be collecting,” Lezer’s attorney, Aharon S. Kaye of Skokie, Illinois, said in an interview. “But from a procedural standpoint they will have another opportunity to respond.”
Via text message, Grady declined to speak about the suit with a reporter, instead referring questions about it to one of his attorneys, Jeffrey Bennett of Legal-Ease LLP in South Portland. In an interview, Bennett asserted that Noble and Grady “haven’t received proper notice to be joined to the case” despite a summons having been issued to both Aug. 7.
“A summons is one in a series of steps for there to be proper notice,” Bennett said, adding that for various technical reasons the status of the case was not as it appeared.
Bennett also provided a completely different description of events: He said Noble was acting as a broker on a deal between Lezer and a supplier, and that Lezer had lost its claim to the deposit by trying to cut out the middle man and acquire the wipes directly from Noble’s source of supply. He said Noble might file its own suit against Lezer and the supplier.
Kaye, Lezer’s attorney on the case, expressed surprise at this version of events but declined to comment on the details of a case in active litigation.
Separately, the Press Herald was recently contacted by Bauman, the Media Reps president, who said Noble had failed to deliver a June 10 order of 2.5 million N95 respirators and failed to return the $100,000 deposit his company had made on them.
Bauman shared a long email chain and screenshots of text messages he had exchanged with Grady and other Noble Partners employees that documented his four-month effort to get the deposit returned, during which Grady repeatedly said the refund was being processed or that it had been issued.
“They said they will refund it and didn’t, and still they would claim it was issued,” Bauman told the Press Herald. “They were lying to me. It’s still not refunded — it’s just blatant fraud with these guys.”
By text message, Grady referred questions about Bauman’s accusations — and those made online by the web hosting service — to another lawyer, Stephean Chute of Cape Elizabeth, who did not return calls or respond to email messages.
In July, the Press Herald was contacted by one of Noble’s sales representatives, Rob Close of San Antonio, who said he was owed $4,000 in unpaid commissions and that he had stopped representing Noble after it delivered faulty surgical masks to one of his customers, University Hospital of San Antonio, which was then serving a community facing a dramatic explosion in COVID-19 cases.
A spokesperson for the hospital’s parent entity, Leni Kirkman of University Health System, confirmed via email that some of the masks — which were set out for visitors to wear inside the facility — “had holes in them or were falling apart.” She said the hospital had not paid for the masks upfront and that Noble did not appear to be seeking payment for the faulty products.
Grady first attracted attention in March when he started taking orders from municipalities, fire departments and hospitals in Massachusetts for N95 respirators, three-ply masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and other critical medical supplies that first responders and front-line health care workers were having trouble obtaining. His company, which had no experience in medical supplies, claimed to be able to secure hundreds of thousands of the coveted N95s and also offered to sell COVID-19 tests.
The Press Herald reported March 26 that Grady is facing a five-count criminal grand jury indictment in Cumberland County Superior Court on charges of securities fraud, theft by deception and selling securities without a license for incidents predating the pandemic. The indictment alleges Grady defrauded two investment clients, in one case by falsely representing that the funds would be invested in Noble Partners, and that the individual would be made chief technology officer of the company. He was originally scheduled to appear in court April 22, but the pandemic has postponed civil proceedings indefinitely.
Grady also has been permanently barred from being granted securities licenses and registration privileges in New Hampshire after he failed to respond to a November 2018 cease-and-desist order connected with one of the alleged frauds. Jeff Spills, deputy director of that state’s Bureau of Securities Regulation, told the Press Herald in March that Grady owed the state $238,471 in fines and restitution imposed in its summary administrative judgment against him, part of which was to compensate the alleged victim, an elderly woman from Charlestown, New Hampshire.
In the last days of March, Noble did deliver masks and respirators as promised to several Massachusetts hospitals and municipal first responders, an effort that required Diane Russell to drive to New York in a rented van to collect them in the middle of that city’s pandemic crisis.

Texto completo: The Channel 6 newscaster is retiring from his more than 30-year career to work as a personal trainer.
Longtime TV news reporter and anchor Lee Nelson, who grew up in TV studios as the son of a news anchor, will end a long career in the news business Friday when he retires from News Center Maine.
“It’s a little surreal, having spent my entire adult life doing one thing to now be doing something else,” Nelson, 58, said Thursday in a telephone interview.
“But at the same time, I feel fine. I am not rethinking it. My father was 52 when he died, and he had some unfilled goals and plans, and I hear that so often. People wait to retire and then they are not healthy enough to do what they want to do. I am healthy and I want to do something else. I have accomplished everything I can (in TV news), and now I would like to accomplish some other things.”
His new career is in fitness. Nelson, a self-described gym rat since his teens and certified personal trainer since 2010, will work with clients at Foley’s Fitness Center in Scarborough.
Nelson’s father was a news anchor in Maine, Boston and New York. TV news was an unlikely career for Nelson, despite his father’s success in the business. He grew up with what he calls “quite a substantial stammer” and had to learn to conquer it before he flourished in front of a camera.
“I don’t know that I have fully conquered it yet, but I certainly have conquered it on the air. When I am really tired and really stressed, it comes out,” he said.
Nelson started his career in broadcasting in 1985 when he got a job as a page at NBC in New York giving studio tours and seating audiences for “Saturday Night Live” and other shows. He has been with WCSH since 1990, when he began hosting the News Center Maine “Morning Report.” He remained on the morning show for one month shy of 30 years, before switching to the evening news in 2019. Friday night’s broadcast will be his last.
Nelson is married to his co-anchor, Cindy Williams. They met while working together in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, his first on-air job. This week on WCSH’s news magazine show “207,” he said he had few regrets, other than waiting so long to join his wife side-by-side on the evening news. “Should have done that earlier,” Nelson said.
They live in Biddeford, where they recently relocated from Falmouth in an effort to downsize, and have two sons in their 20s.
They worked together at the NBC affiliate in Hattiesburg for 14 months, before moving to New England. “I wanted to stick around with her, but I didn’t want to stick around Hattiesburg,” said Nelson, a Lewiston native. She got a job in New Hampshire and he picked up freelance work in Boston, before they both ended up in Portland.
Writing on the News Center Maine website, “207” co-host Rob Caldwell said he would miss his longtime colleague. “Lee has been a friend of mine for more than 30 years, and I’ll miss seeing him in the newsroom, talking about what’s happening across the street or around the world, swapping gossip, cracking jokes,” Caldwell wrote. “But I admire his enthusiasm as he leaves behind the only professional life he’s known as an adult and heads down new roads. As I’ve had to say too many times over the years when colleagues depart: Good for him, bad for us.”
Nelson began his career in TV after his father died, so his father never saw him on the air or knew of his interest in broadcasting. He said his father would be “flabbergasted” to know that his son spent more than 30 years delivering the news to audiences in Maine. “My life has been kind of written by him in a lot of ways. I have tried to do the things he had done and enjoyed and tried to avoid the things that didn’t work out for him,” he said.
His mother, who lived in Maine, died three years ago.
Nelson’s father jumped around in his career, from Maine to Boston to New York, in pursuit of better jobs in bigger markets. That movement created stress for the family and was something that Nelson wanted to avoid when he committed to a career in broadcasting. Once they found something they liked in Maine, Nelson and Williams decided to settle and raise a family. “We were really comfortable at Channel 6. It was a great place to work, and it made sense to stay.”
He said he would miss interacting with viewers and co-workers, and said the best part of the job was connecting with people across Maine. He said he made his decision to leave the news business last winter, before the pandemic, and acknowledged that now is a turbulent, tumultuous time for news reporters. In a parting message, he urged viewers to treat the news seriously and dismissed any notion that the news is fake.
“It’s really frustrating there are so many people out there who think we make up the news,” Nelson said. “It’s crazy. But it’s there. That didn’t used to be the case, until four or five years ago. Then all of sudden people were thinking we’re not telling the truth.”

Texto completo: The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry in Augusta seeks the public’s help in locating ash trees sold at Lowe’s stores in Maine during spring and summer 2020. DACF Horticulture and Forest Health officials are concerned that the trees may contain emerald ash borer, an invasive insect that kills ash trees. The trees originated at a nursery located in an EAB infested and quarantined area.
Customers purchased 36 of these trees during spring and summer from Lowe’s stores in Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, Brewer, Brunswick, Portland, Sanford, Scarborough, Thomaston and Windham. The trees were potted, sold for $29.98, and labeled as Ash Green, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, according to a news release from the DACF.
Customers who have not already been contacted by Lowe’s are asked to get in touch with Maine State Horticulture Program, by emailing bugwatch@maine.gov or calling 207-287-7545.
DACF suggests that everyone refrain from planting any ash tree (Fraxinus spp., not mountain-ash) and the white fringe tree (Chionanthus sp.). EAB is established in Maine, and EAB infestations surround the state in Vermont, New Hampshire, New Brunswick, and Quebec. Ornamental ash trees in areas with EAB infestation require regular application of insecticides to survive and thrive. For more information about emerald ash borer, visit maine.gov/eab.
DACF extends its gratitude to Lowe’s and Clinton Nurseries for their response to this ash tree incident. DACF and Lowes staff worked collaboratively to address the situation, inform customers who purchased ash trees, and hang informational signage at Lowe’s stores throughout Maine.

Travis Roy, inspiration to many, dies at 45

Texto completo: html> The Maine native became an inspiration to millions after he was paralyzed just 11 seconds into the first shift of his college hockey career at Boston University.

Travis Roy, the Maine native whose life inspired millions after he was paralyzed in his first college hockey game, died Thursday.
Roy’s death was confirmed by his brother-in-law, Keith VanOrden, who is acting as the family spokesman. Roy was 45.
Roy died at the University of Vermont Medical Center, where he was rushed to have surgery Tuesday after suffering complications from a previous surgery.
VanOrden, said Roy, who was just 20 years old when he was paralyzed, was an inspiration to everyone he met.
“He provided hope for people,” said VanOrden, who was acting as the family spokesman. “Anybody who ever spent an hour, or even 10 minutes, with Trav left feeling better. He was an inspiration, he put life in perspective. To him it was all about family and friends.
“It was a 25-year hardship on him, but it was a 25-year gift for all of us who got to spend time with him.”
Roy was a freshman at Boston University when he jumped onto the ice for his first shift as a collegian Oct. 20, 1995. Eleven seconds later, he was down on the ice, paralyzed after sliding head-first into the boards and severely damaging his spinal cord.
He would never let that injury define his life. In 1997, Roy would establish the Travis Roy Foundation to help spinal cord injury survivors and to fund research for a cure. And while he used a wheelchair for the rest of his life, he traveled across the country, speaking about his accident and his life and raising millions of dollars for spinal cord injury research.
The foundation has helped more than 2,100 quadriplegics and paraplegics, and awarded nearly $5 million in grants toward spinal cord research, according to its website.
“Really his legacy was created after his playing career, what he’s been able to do and inspire,” said Scott Rousseau, the girls’ hockey coach at Cheverus High. “His legacy is one of inspiration. Life isn’t always fair. In fact, it’s more often not fair. If anyone needs a better example of someone who was dealt an awful hand and persevered and maintained a positive attitude his entire life, it’s Travis Roy. You only have to look at what he’d gone through and he still kept such an amazing love of life. This is a sad day, indeed.”
Rousseau was part of the committee that established the Travis Roy Award, given annually to the best boys’ hockey player in Maine. Roy’s name, he said, lent prestige to the award.
“There are people that transcend sports,” Rousseau said. “In Maine, Travis Roy is someone who transcended hockey.”
Tom Caron, the Lewiston native who is the studio host for the Boston Red Sox pre- and post-game shows on NESN, first got to know Roy while he was still in high school, calling a state championship game for WGME-TV.
Later, after Roy’s injury, Caron got to know the Roy family, especially parents Lee and Brenda, very well.
“I am crushed, absolutely crushed, as are many people,” said Caron, who recently texted with Roy on the 25th anniversary of his injury. “He might be the most inspirational person I’ve ever met in my life. Here was a guy who, who in his darkest hour, found a life that impacted countless families, countless people, who went through what he went through. And he was reaching out to them in their darkest hour and lifting them up.
“Travis was about hope. He never gave up hope. He always believed there was a better tomorrow, a better life, that there would be improvements. That’s a hell of a life.”
Since 2001, Roy would hold a whiffle ball tournament in Essex, Vermont, raising more than $6.4 million for the Travis Roy Foundation. That foundation is one reason his legacy will live forever, said Caron.
“I can’t tell you how many stories I’ve heard from people who know someone who was in a car accident or a hockey accident and in a hospital dealing with paralysis,” said Caron. “They’d ask the foundation if they could get hold of Travis. And then you’d find out that Travis had already been over at the hospital and talked to them. He would mobilize his resources to help people before most of us were even aware an accident had happened.
“He always remembered what he and his family went through. And he knew exactly what he could do, what the foundation could do, to help at the point where they think there is no hope, that their life is over. He was an amazing person.”
Roy was born in Augusta and played at North Yarmouth Academy, where the ice rink was renamed in his honor in 1998. Roy’s father Lee was the rink manager at NYA for many years.
Ben Jackson, NYA’s Head of School, first met Roy in the fall of 2015 when the private school held a ceremony to retire Roy’s jersey and a fund-raiser for the Travis Roy Foundation.
“He’s been back since then to speak to our students and just two years ago we inducted him as an honorary member into our athletic hall of fame,” Jackson said. “He’s just been a great friend to our school and as you can imagine an inspiration to our students. He was a tremendous speaker. He could hold an audience. You could hear a pin drop in a room of a 100, 200 students.”
In a statement sent by NYA, Jackson added, “We will continue to honor his legacy of his life’s work and greatly treasure the memories of his continued involvement, commitment to, and support of the Academy.”
Colby College men’s hockey coach Blaise MacDonald was an assistant under Jack Parker at BU from 1991 to 1996.
MacDonald said he recruited Roy to BU and got to know his family really well.
“There’s a lot of emotion,” said a shaken up MacDonald. “He’s been an angel to so many people. His life was very challenging, every day, but you would never know it when you talked to him. It’s just very tough.”
MacDonald recalled a rigorous recruiting process that pitted BU against the rival University of Maine.
“I recruited him to BU out of Tabor Academy (Marion, Massachusetts),” MacDonald said. “I got to know his family really well. He chose BU over Maine. We developed this relationship. It was exciting to think about his future at BU.
“I had a very good relationship with his family. It was a tough battle recruiting him. He was a very kind, considerate young man. Very thoughtful. He was also very tough to read, what he was really thinking. It was between Maine and BU and being a Maine kid, it was a tough battle for us. Getting to know his dad, he had a hockey history. And his mom was a sweetheart. You know, you don’t just recruit the kid, but the family.”
For everything Roy endured. VanOrden said he never forgot where he came from.
“In talking to him, one of the messages that came through loud and clear was this overwhelming sense of gratitude he had for the entire New England community but more importantly the places he was from,” said VanOrden. “And he still wanted to see how good he could be and how much of an impact he could have, whether it was as a hockey player or, now, the person running foundation to help people less fortunate than him.”
And, VanOrden said, his parents are grateful for all the support they’ve received. “The outpouring of love and support is overwhelming,” he said.
Tributes to Roy’s philanthropy and impact on others poured across social media.
“It is with heavy hearts that we mourn the passing of Travis Roy,” Boston University Athletics wrote in a statement. “His story is the epitome of inspiration and courage, and he was a role model and a hero to so many people.”
Mike Eruzione, a former BU player and captain of the 1980 U.S. “Miracle on Ice” Olympic team wrote on Twitter: “Sad day after hearing of the passing of Travis Roy he was a very special person. He dedicated his life to helping so many. Raised so much money for spinal cord injuries and those who suffered. He will be missed but his spirit and smile will be remembered forever RIP my friend.”
“Travis Roy was the ultimate symbol of determination and courage,” Boston Bruins President Cam Neely said.
Hockey East issued a similar sentiment: “The entire conference family mourns Travis’s passing. Travis Roy was one of the most cherished members of our family and his legacy will live on for generations to come.”

Texto completo: A total of two positive and four probable cases have been reported this week at Gardiner Area High School, and a total of 156 people from the school are under quarantine until the end next week.
GARDINER — There are now two positive and four probable COVID-19 cases at Gardiner Area High School, according to Maine School Administrative District 11 officials.
MSAD 11 Superintendent Pat Hopkins sent an update letter late Wednesday night. In addition to the COVID-19 cases that have been reported, 129 high school students and 27 on staff at the high school are under quarantine through either Nov 5. or Nov. 6, according to Hopkins.
Hopkins said everyone who has been in close contact with the individuals has been contacted, but it remained unclear Thursday if the cases involve teachers or students.
“With the support of the CDC (Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention), and school district nurses and administrations are actively contact tracing to identify students and staff members who have been in close contact with the two individuals that tested positive for COVID, and the four individuals who are currently probable positive,” Hopkins wrote.
Close contact for a student is defined as “anyone that has been in a classroom with another person for more than 15 minutes that has been confirmed as COVID positive or probable positive,” according to information Hopkins attached to the bottom of the letter to help families better understand the process.
After being in close contact, the individual must quarantine for 14 days from the date of possible exposure.
On Monday, the district reported a probable positive case, followed by a Tuesday report of two positive cases.
Gardiner Area High School is hosting Election Day next Tuesday, and the gymnasium area will undergo extensive cleaning and sanitation, according to Town Manager Alisha Ballard.
Maine is seeing the biggest spike in coronavirus cases since late May. The state reported 87 new cases Tuesday and another 80 Wednesday.
In her letter, Hopkins reminded students and staff members to practice social distancing, wear masks and maintain good hygiene.
The high school will continue operating in a “red” learning model through Nov. 6, meaning students will have all of their classes conducted virtually.

DRESDEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL There is also contact tracing underway at Dresden Elementary School after one positive COVID-19 test was reported Wednesday, according to Regional School Unit 2 Superintendent Tonya Arnold.
Arnold addressed the situation in a letter Wednesday, noting no other person is impacted by the case.
Dresden Elementary School will undergo extensive cleaning and sanitation.
Students will be learning fully remote through Nov. 6. Previously, they were learning under a hybrid model.
The school is part of RSU 2, which two weeks ago had another school, Monmouth Memorial School, report a positive COVID-19 case.
Arnold said no other school in RSU 2 has been impacted by this latest case.
“These situations are stressful for everyone, but especially for those closest to the situation,” Arnold wrote. “Please be supportive and protect the privacy of others, and demonstrate the RSU community compassion that makes us strong.”

Texto completo: The Maine native became an inspiration to millions after he was paralyzed just 11 seconds into the first shift of his college hockey career at Boston University.
Travis Roy, the Maine native whose life inspired millions after he was paralyzed in his first college hockey game, died Thursday.
Roy’s death was confirmed by his brother-in-law, Keith VanOrden, who is acting as the family spokesman. Roy was 45.
Roy died at the University of Vermont Medical Center, where he was rushed to have surgery Tuesday after suffering complications from a previous surgery.
VanOrden, said Roy, who was just 20 years old when he was paralyzed, was an inspiration to everyone he met.
“He provided hope for people,” said VanOrden, who was acting as the family spokesman. “Anybody who ever spent an hour, or even 10 minutes, with Trav left feeling better. He was an inspiration, he put life in perspective. To him it was all about family and friends.
“It was a 25-year hardship on him, but it was a 25-year gift for all of us who got to spend time with him.”
Roy was a freshman at Boston University when he jumped onto the ice for his first shift as a collegian Oct. 20, 1995. Eleven seconds later, he was down on the ice, paralyzed after sliding head-first into the boards and severely damaging his spinal cord.
He would never let that injury define his life. In 1997, Roy would establish the Travis Roy Foundation to help spinal cord injury survivors and to fund research for a cure. And while he used a wheelchair for the rest of his life, he traveled across the country, speaking about his accident and his life and raising millions of dollars for spinal cord injury research.
The foundation has helped more than 2,100 quadriplegics and paraplegics, and awarded nearly $5 million in grants toward spinal cord research, according to its website.
“Really his legacy was created after his playing career, what he’s been able to do and inspire,” said Scott Rousseau, the girls’ hockey coach at Cheverus High. “His legacy is one of inspiration. Life isn’t always fair. In fact, it’s more often not fair. If anyone needs a better example of someone who was dealt an awful hand and persevered and maintained a positive attitude his entire life, it’s Travis Roy. You only have to look at what he’d gone through and he still kept such an amazing love of life. This is a sad day, indeed.”
Rousseau was part of the committee that established the Travis Roy Award, given annually to the best boys’ hockey player in Maine. Roy’s name, he said, lent prestige to the award.
“There are people that transcend sports,” Rousseau said. “In Maine, Travis Roy is someone who transcended hockey.”
Tom Caron, the Lewiston native who is the studio host for the Boston Red Sox pre- and post-game shows on NESN, first got to know Roy while he was still in high school, calling a state championship game for WGME-TV. Later, after Roy’s injury, Caron got to know the Roy family, especially parents Lee and Brenda, very well.
“I am crushed, absolutely crushed, as are many people,” said Caron, who recently texted with Roy on the 25th anniversary of his injury. “He might be the most inspirational person I’ve ever met in my life. Here was a guy who, who in his darkest hour, found a life that impacted countless families, countless people, who went through what he went through. And he was reaching out to them in their darkest hour and lifting them up.
“Travis was about hope. He never gave up hope. He always believed there was a better tomorrow, a better life, that there would be improvements. That’s a hell of a life.”
Since 2001, Roy would hold a whiffle ball tournament in Essex, Vermont, raising more than $6.4 million for the Travis Roy Foundation. That foundation is one reason his legacy will live forever, said Caron.
“I can’t tell you how many stories I’ve heard from people who know someone who was in a car accident or a hockey accident and in a hospital dealing with paralysis,” said Caron. “They’d ask the foundation if they could get hold of Travis. And then you’d find out that Travis had already been over at the hospital and talked to them. He would mobilize his resources to help people before most of us were even aware an accident had happened.
“He always remembered what he and his family went through. And he knew exactly what he could do, what the foundation could do, to help at the point where they think there is no hope, that their life is over. He was an amazing person.”
Roy was born in Augusta and played at North Yarmouth Academy, where the ice rink was renamed in his honor in 1998. Roy’s father Lee was the rink manager at NYA for many years.
Ben Jackson, NYA’s Head of School, first met Roy in the fall of 2015 when the private school held a ceremony to retire Roy’s 00 jersey and a fund-raiser for the Travis Roy Foundation.
“He’s been back since then to speak to our students and just two years ago we inducted him as an honorary member into our athletic hall of fame,” Jackson said. “He’s just been a great friend to our school and as you can imagine an inspiration to our students. He was a tremendous speaker. He could hold an audience. You could hear a pin drop in a room of a 100, 200 students.”

Texto completo: Oct. 30, 1991: A hurricane later commemorated in Sebastian Junger’s best-selling book “The Perfect Storm” and a film of the same name reaches peak intensity off Canada’s Atlantic coast.
The then-unnamed storm began to grow Oct. 28, when it sank the Gloucester, Massachusetts-based fishing boat Andrea Gail, killing its six crew members.
Also known as “the Halloween storm,” the multiday event batters Maine and the rest of the Eastern Seaboard — especially Massachusetts, where 100 homes are destroyed or severely damaged. Damage is reported as far south as Jamaica and as far north as Newfoundland. At its Oct. 30 peak, the storm generates ocean waves from 40 to 80 feet.
In Maine, hundreds of homes are affected, most prominently the summer residence of then-President George H.W. Bush on Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport. The famous vacation residence, visited by several world leaders, sustains extensive damage when the wind and water knock out windows and flood the interior.
Waves of up to 25 feet plow ashore and smash into houses at Camp Ellis, part of Saco, and 20 families are evacuated.
In Kennebunkport, water 3 feet deep covers 1.5 miles of Beach Avenue and penetrates about 40 houses across the street. Police report high water reaching the first floor of about houses in Wells.
Twelve vulnerable houses in Cape Elizabeth are evacuated.
The tidal surge, propelled by 50-mph winds, is one of the 10 most severe in Maine’s history to that time.

Texto completo: The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry in Augusta seeks the public’s help in locating ash trees sold at Lowe’s stores in Maine during spring and summer 2020. DACF Horticulture and Forest Health officials are concerned that the trees may contain emerald ash borer, an invasive insect that kills ash trees. The trees originated at a nursery located in an EAB infested and quarantined area.
Customers purchased 36 of these trees during spring and summer from Lowe’s stores in Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, Brewer, Brunswick, Portland, Sanford, Scarborough, Thomaston and Windham. The trees were potted, sold for $29.98, and labeled as Ash Green, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, according to a news release from the DACF.
Customers who have not already been contacted by Lowe’s are asked to get in touch with Maine State Horticulture Program, by emailing bugwatch@maine.gov or calling 207-287-7545.
DACF suggests that everyone refrain from planting any ash tree (Fraxinus spp., not mountain-ash) and the white fringe tree (Chionanthus sp.). EAB is established in Maine, and EAB infestations surround the state in Vermont, New Hampshire, New Brunswick, and Quebec. Ornamental ash trees in areas with EAB infestation require regular application of insecticides to survive and thrive. For more information about emerald ash borer, visit maine.gov/eab.
DACF extends its gratitude to Lowe’s and Clinton Nurseries for their response to this ash tree incident. DACF and Lowes staff worked collaboratively to address the situation, inform customers who purchased ash trees, and hang informational signage at Lowe’s stores throughout Maine.

Texto completo: Biofine Developments Northeast Inc. of Bangor has formed a partnership with Sprague Resources LP to produce a patented biofuel made from forest product waste.

A research and development company that has spent nearly 20 years honing new ways to turn woody waste into commercially viable energy and chemicals says it is close to building a biorefinery in Maine that will produce zero-emission heating oil.
Biofine Developments Northeast Inc. of Bangor said it has formed a partnership with New Hampshire-based wholesale energy supplier Sprague Resources LP to help produce and market a patented biofuel made from 100% ethyl levulinate, an organic chemical compound often referred to as EL.
Biofine said it hopes to finalize the site of its first biorefinery within the next month and be operating by 2023. The plant would process 100 tons a day of cellulose-based waste, primarily from paper and lumber mills, to make 3 million gallons of heating oil a year. It also would produce a side stream of renewable chemical byproducts that can be sold.
Biofine is working with Treadwell Franklin Infrastructure Capital, a developer and financier involved in other Maine ventures, to help it bring the project to commercial scale and raise $70 million from private investors.
Those partnerships signal what could be a major development for Maine’s energy and forest product markets, as well as a new and unexpected tool in the state’s ambitious quest to slash greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.
Policy makers in Maine and across the Northeast are pushing homes and businesses to dump boilers and furnaces that run on oil in favor of efficient electric units, namely heat pumps. But if a 100% concentration of Biofine’s fuel — known as EL100 — can be made at competitive prices and widely distributed in the region, heating oil could become a locally produced, renewable energy source.
That would be of special interest in Maine, where six in 10 homes still rely on oil as their primary heat source. Residents and businesses would be able to burn the cleaner fuel without making any changes to their heating equipment.
“This puts the heating oil industry in a unique position,” said Mike Cassata, Biofine’s chief development officer. “The infrastructure is already in place. They have the expertise for distribution and storage. They could help lead the green energy movement.”
Independent testing shows that EL100 gives off zero greenhouse gas emissions, according to Biofine. The company said it also has worked with industry labs to make sure EL100 can be burned safely in existing equipment, and conducted a small trial earlier this year in buildings at the University of Maine at Presque Isle. The company also received a $750,000 grant from the Maine Technology Institute to support commercial development.
Biofine was founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, who remains its president and chief executive. Fitzpatrick has been striving for years to bring the technology to market, starting at a small-scale plant in Gorham in 2006. He has since worked extensively with UMaine’s Forest Bioproducts Research Institute. They jointly operate a pilot plant at the institute’s facility next to the ND Paper mill in Old Town.
The Old Town mill was a candidate for the biorefinery in 2017, but it became unavailable. A subsequent plan to locate at the former Verso paper mill in Bucksport also fell through, with that site now slated to become a salmon farm. Cassata declined to identify the latest planned location.

THE FUTURE OF OIL The potential for a biorefinery in Maine is exciting news for the National Energy & Fuels Institute, the Washington, D.C., trade group representing oil, propane and biofuel dealers. The industry has been trying to slow a steady migration of heating oil customers to alternatives including natural gas and heat pumps and is under pressure to transition to cleaner fuels.
In September, the group pledged that the heating oil industry would cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, and eliminate fossil energy use by 2050. The resolution was backed by various state dealer groups, including the Maine Energy Marketers Association.
To get to zero, the industry needs a 100% renewable replacement that performs well at extremely cold temperatures and is produced in the Northeast, where most of the country’s heating oil is consumed. Biofine could check all those boxes.
“Biofine is the most significant development for our industry that has occurred, in my opinion,” said Sean Cota, president and chief executive of the National Energy & Fuels Institute.
EL100 also could complement the move to electrify heating in the Northeast, Cota said. Oil-fired furnaces work well in extreme cold, so they could take some of the pressure off the electric grid on frigid days, Cota said. That’s when more costly generators are needed to meet hours of peak demand, which is expected to grow as more heat pumps are installed.
“If policymakers are serious about actual climate-change reduction,” Cota said, “renewable heating fuels will get them there faster than anything else, and at no cost to the consumer.”
But consumer cost and interest will likely emerge as marketing issues.
For instance, the industry has for years been blending concentrations of vegetable-based oil into petroleum fuel, creating a product called Bioheat. Concentrations of between 5% and 20% are common, and have been shown to lower key emissions without hurting heating equipment.
The Bioheat fuel known as B-20 (20% biodiesel) is available in Maine, and was selling this week in the Portland area for $1.64 a gallon. That’s only a few cents above the average price for regular heating oil.
But Bioheat isn’t well promoted in Maine. Cota, of the dealers’ group, estimated that Bioheat makes up less than 7% of heating oil sold in the Northeast.
Sprague Resources has years of experience selling a range of Bioheat blends and is among the largest distributors of biodiesel fuel in the region. Based in Portsmouth, Sprague is a publicly traded energy company and major wholesale fuel supplier for the Northeast. It operates a tank farm and terminal in Portland Harbor.
Sprague CEO David Glendon said Biofine’s technology and strategic location make it a logical partner. Sprague said it sees the potential to both blend EL100 with petroleum to lower emissions, and use it as a standalone product for both heating and transportation.
Sprague acknowledged that price will be an important consideration for customers. Cassata said Biofine expects to be able to produce EL100 at prices that can compete with conventional fuel. So it will be up to Sprague and dealers to promote the benefits of a zero-carbon product, and up to consumers to choose it.

‘NOT JUST AN IDEA’ At the moment, the potential benefits of renewable heating oil haven’t drawn much attention at the Maine Climate Council, the body set up to prepare a far-reaching action plan for lawmakers to consider next year. Reflecting a recent law, the goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 45% by 2030, and 80% by 2050.
The council’s draft report, being finalized now for release Dec. 1, suggests looking into a requirement that a certain percentage of heating fuels sold in Maine be renewable.
“This would encourage the development of renewable fuels and technologies in Maine, such as biofuels made from wood biomass, biodiesel from used vegetable oils, and fuels made from anaerobic digesters on farms,” the draft report says.
A similar requirement already exists for electricity supply, called a Renewable Portfolio Standard. As part of Maine’s climate legislation, that mandate is being raised from 40% now to 80% in 2030.
Biofine is a member of Biobased Maine, the trade group promoting sustainable manufacturing and biomass solutions. The group’s executive director, Marina Bowie, said the planned biorefinery would help create new markets for waste wood from sawmills and the state’s surviving paper mills. To her, the partnership with Sprague is a key indicator that the project is on a path to reality.
“For a company like Biofine looking to scale up, getting purchase agreements with a big company like Sprague is huge,” she said. “It’s not just an idea anymore. It’s a real thing and it’s coming to Maine.”
Bowie noted that heating oil is the market entry point for Biofine, but the chemical byproducts will likely have an even higher value. The economics will be helped by a new Maine law that extends tax credits to the production of renewable chemicals and biofuels.
But Biofine is at a critical point, Bowie said. Many companies validate their technologies at universities at a demonstration level, but stumble when they can’t raise enough capital to reach commercial scale.
“They need funding to overcome the valley-of-death stage,” she said.

PORTLAND, Maine -- Two days before Rachel Helm could reopen her Portland hair salon under strict safety guidelines, she shelled out $300 worth of cleaning supplies she ordered online.
In a pandemic, those supplies could take weeks to arrive, and she still needs to get face masks, shields, gloves and gowns before she can cut anyone's hair.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Maine is among roughly a dozen states to partially reopen select non-essential businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. About half of those states are including personal care-services where workers and clients come into close contact -- like barber shops and hair salons -- to reopen in the first phase, observing social distancing guidelines.
State officials released a checklist of rigorous safety protocols for personal services like hair salons and barber shops to adhere to before re-open on May 1. The state's checklist requires barbers to use disposable gloves, gowns, drapes, linens and eye coverings between each client, making it more restrictive than those issued in Colorado and Montana.
Many Maine barbers and salon owners are finding them so burdensome that they are puzzled the state would expect them to open at all. Helm, who owns a hair salon called Pageboy on Market Street, believes it's still too early -- many of her colleagues agree -- and following the safety protocols adds labor and "crippling" overhead costs.
"I'm going to be shelling out a ton of money just to meet those guidelines," she said. "Being able to make the money I was making before is impossible."
This week, Helm wrote a letter to Gov. Janet Mills protesting the state's decision to include barbers and hair stylists in the first wave of businesses to reopen. The letter was signed by five other salon owners around the state, saying many in the industry are "feeling the urge to rush into unsafe situations." A spokesperson for Maine's economic development department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It also noted that the day certain personal services would re-open is also the first day that salon workers, many of whom are self-employed, would be eligible for benefits under the federal pandemic unemployment assistance program.
Maine's four-phased plan to reopen the economy does not require businesses to open the dates on its timeline. Many self-employed and temporary workers are eligible for pandemic unemployment assistance benefits if their workplaces remain closed due to the virus.
"Whether morally or financially we have to make a decision, and if we make the moral decision we're potentially screwing ourselves," Helm said.
Wayne Wood was gunning to open his Machias barber shop on Friday, but that effort was frustrated after he wrangled with the demands of the checklist. Wood cuts hair in Washington County, a region of Maine with two COVID-19 cases confirmed by the CDC, far from the outbreaks in Cumberland County.
He plans to be in compliance when he opens, he said, but he's having trouble sourcing necessary supplies, like disposable capes and smocks, without breaking the budget. Seeking a workaround, Wood bought a box of 30-gallon garbage bags this morning. He plans to cut them open and utilize them as gowns, fitting them over customers while they sit in the chair.
"I think my customers will all respond pretty well," he said. "Nobody has a choice in this."

Texto completo: Up Beat is a new section of the Bangor Daily News dedicated to uplifting stories. Look for tales of people helping people and things that will make you smile.
Sometimes it's the little things that can bring the biggest smiles -- you just need to know where to look. For example, cast your eyes downward while walking around Downtown Bangor and you might see a variety of brightly painted rocks and stones.
Turns out, there are quite a few of them scattered around and it's pretty hard not to see them once the hunt for them is on. Here are just a few that are currently brightening up Downtown Bangor.
While the rocks are brightening days now during the time of social distancing, they aren't new to Bangor -- or Maine. For several years they have been popping up around the city and in other local communities like Bucksport, where the town council dedicated a tree on a local walking path to the project. Nationally, there's also a movement called The Kindness Rocks Project that began in 2015 and has spread to cities and towns across the country.
The idea is pretty simple -- find a rock, paint a message and/or design on the rock and then leave it somewhere for folks to find. If painting the rocks is half the fun, the other half is looking for and finding them. They are easy to spot with their bright colors contrasting with the more earth tones of the curbs, sidewalks, other paved spots and even urban tree stumps on which they are often placed.
Here are some of our favorites recently spotted around Downtown Bangor.
Who doesn't want to be told they are "pawsome"? This rock gets the sentiment across with a written message and a line drawing of a very happy -- and awesome -- looking dog.
This tree stump in front of The Phoenix Building got upscaled with a brightly designed rock on top and one at its base urging passersby to make a wish.
[image id="2970668" size="full" pos="center" /]
Just in case it gets lost in the hustle and bustle of daily life, here's a rock that is a reminder of the importance of a smile.
[image id="2970669" size="full" pos="center" /]
Sometimes it's good to be reminded that meandering while lost in thought or dreaming of future plans is a great way to spend some time during the day.
[image id="2970670" size="full" pos="center" /]
These rocks' simple messages can never be seen or said enough.
[image id="2970671" size="full" pos="center" /]
This rock reminds us that when done with love, even small actions can have huge impacts.
[image id="2970672" size="full" pos="center" /]
Some of the rocks reflect current events by asking people to stay indoors and practice social distancing to help control the spread of COVID-19. In one case it's a festive play on words complete with glitter.
[image id="2970673" size="full" pos="center" /]
Another rock suggests the alternative to maintaining social distance by staying at home is far out -- as in outer space.
[image id="2970675" size="full" pos="center" /]
When people find rocks, they are encouraged to snap a photo or selfie with it and post on social media. The rocks can be kept, passed along to others or even rehidden elsewhere. Some rock fans make a game out of finding a rock in one town and bringing it to a different town or even to another state and placing it outdoors for others to find. Have you found one you've loved?

Searching for reptiles and amphibians is a fun spring activity

Texto completo: Wrapped around a submerged tree branch, the egg mass blended into the dead leaves and muck at the bottom of the woodland pool. I would have missed it if I hadn't been specifically searching for frog and salamander eggs. I'd been checking the pool for weeks in hopes of some activity.
I knelt down for a closer look, and as I focused on the dark, velvety eggs -- perfect spheres, each floating inside a clear protective ball -- they began to appear alien and so very obvious.
Such is the case with many things in nature. Even the most colorful and intricately patterned birds can blend into their surroundings if you're not actively looking for them. That's why observing wildlife and other things in nature usually requires a person to slow down and study the landscape like a "Where's Waldo" drawing.
[image id="2970649" size="full" pos="center" /]
That day, my husband, Derek, and I found several clusters of eggs. At first, they appeared to be from the same amphibian, but on closer inspection, there were slight differences in the egg masses. So I did some reading when I returned home and learned from several sources -- including a very detailed and helpful blog post by the Orianne Society -- that we likely found both frog and salamander eggs in our local pools.
You can tell them apart fairly easily, I learned, because frog eggs have just one protective transparent layer surrounding each egg. Salamander eggs have two protective transparent layers: the layer that surrounds each egg, plus a layer that surrounds the whole cluster.
[image id="2970641" size="full" pos="center" /]
Based on the time of year, I think we found wood frog eggs. Maine is home to nine species of frogs and toads, and their reproductive cycles are staggered. Wood frogs and spring peepers emerge first to lay eggs in early spring. I haven't heard any peepers yet, but I'll keep watching these egg masses to see how they develop. I could easily be wrong.
I also think we found salamander eggs, though I'm not sure what kind of salamander. To learn a bit more about what salamanders we have in Maine, I skimmed " The Amphibians and Reptiles of Maine," which was published in 1992 by The Maine Amphibian and Reptile Atlas Project. The resource is available for free online through the University of Maine library. It lists nine different salamander species in Maine. I had no idea.
Back in the forest, leaving the pools behind, Derek and I walked along the streambed with our dog, Oreo. At a sandy bend in the waterway, I noticed (what I thought was) a fish struggling in the sand. But as I drew closer, I noticed four tiny little arms extended on either side of the creature's brown body. It was a salamander, though I couldn't tell you for certain what kind. My best guess is the two-lined salamander, which is "the smallest, most abundant and most widely distributed" of the three "brook salamanders" according to "The Amphibians and Reptiles of Maine." "Two-lined salamanders are so abundant they can be found in virtually every stream, rocky seep, and watershed in Maine."
The other two "brook salamanders" are the dusky salamander and the spring salamander. If I'd gotten a closer look, maybe I could say for certain which one we found, but just as I drew near to the animal, Oreo splashed into the stream and scared it off. The salamander swam swiftly away.
[Watch my previous "backyard safari" here]
In addition to amphibians, reptiles are starting to emerge, I've noticed. Just a few days ago, I visited a few nearby ponds to find dozens of eastern painted turtles sunning on half-submerged logs. I also came across a large garter snake, which appeared to be drinking water from a puddle in the middle of a hiking trail. It didn't even notice me until I was inches from it -- with my camera, of course.
[image id="2970644" size="full" pos="center" /]
Garter snakes are Maine's most common snake, but I find them interesting because they're always slightly different in color and the distinctiveness of their pattern. This particular garter snake displayed a lot of yellow.
As for my backyard birds, the eastern phoebes have stuck around as I'd hoped, and they're starting to get used to me. Of all the species of birds that frequent my yard, they approach me the closest, perching on nearby branches to sing their two-note song.
[image id="2970645" size="full" pos="center" /]
But perhaps the most exciting event this week is my interaction with a northern flicker -- a beautiful woodpecker with a spotted chest and bold colors that include bright yellow on its tail, a strip of red at the back of its head, and a peach face. If you read my column last week, you'll know that in several years of photographing birds, I'd never managed to snap a photo of a northern flicker. Well, I finally did it.
Last week, two northern flickers swooped into my yard to briefly land on a tree. I ran outside in my socks to photograph them, but they flew away, leaving me to wonder if I had imagined them. But just yesterday, as I sat beside a woolly bear caterpillar, watching it crawl across a stone step in front of my house, a northern flicker landed near the top of a tree nearby and announced himself with a loud, long call. I had my camera on me -- as I was filming my weekly video -- so I managed to snap a few photos before he flew away.
[image id="2970648" size="full" pos="center" /]
I can officially add that species to my birding "life list." And now that I can identify it's call, I realize that I've been listening to northern flickers for several days. In fact, I can hear it right now, as I write this column in my at-home office.
So all in all, it has been an exciting week in nature. That's spring in Maine for you. I'm happy that I've the opportunity to observe it, in bits and pieces. It seems I learn something new every time I step outside.

May recognizes clerks, building codes

Texto completo: This month marks the 40th year that communities around the world will celebrate Building Safety Month. With the increased frequency and severity of devastating storms across the country each year, the importance of building safety has become a personal topic whilst building codes continue to protect and save lives.
Building codes incorporate the latest technology and provide the safest, most resilient structures for families and communities. The International Codes, developed by the International Code Council and adopted by the state as part of the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code, are the most widely used and adopted set of building safety codes in the United States.
Code and building officials, plan reviewers, fire inspectors, architects, builders, engineers, design professionals, contractors and staffers in Aroostook County are among the 64,000 members of the International Code Council that created Building Safety Month. All of us work together to provide the first line of defense against building disasters and to ensure the safety of the buildings where we all live, work and play.
Building Safety Month was first observed in 1980 and raises awareness about critical building safety issues from structural to fire prevention, plumbing and mechanical systems, and energy efficiency. This year's campaign theme is "Safer Buildings, Safer Communities, Safer World." The City of Caribou, a member of the International Code Council, cares about the health and safety of all citizens. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions of staff and learn about the essential safety work of the code enforcement department.
Currently, Zoning Administrator Ken Murchison is working to complete a blight survey as part of the Caribou City Council's initiative to reduce blight in our community. Staff are available to answer questions about building plans, and if you are considering a project this year, many resources are available online at the city website: www.cariboumaine.org. Under the "departments" tab, select "code enforcement."
In last month's article, I incorrectly stated the cost of a building permit. A building permit in Caribou is a flat fee of $50. Feel free to call if you have questions. We are here to help.
You know who else is here to help? The City Clerk's office. According to the International Institute of Municipal Clerks website, since 1969 the IIMC has sponsored a week to recognize municipal clerks and increase the public's awareness of the vital services they provide. In 1984 and again in 1994, presidents Ronald Reagan and William Clinton signed proclamations declaring Professional Municipal Clerks Week as the first full week of May, recognizing the essential role municipal clerks play in local government.
Nationwide, clerks work closely with community leaders to observe all legislative proprieties, keep minutes of meetings, maintain ordinances and resolutions and preserve historical records. In Maine, clerks must receive education and training to carry out important functions such as: elections, vital records (births, deaths, marriages) and general duties such as dog licenses, Inland Fisheries & Wildlife licensing, permits and stickers, and vehicle excise and registration. In Caribou, the City Clerk's office does all these things, plus collects property taxes and permit fees. Additionally, the City Clerk administers General Assistance and acts as the Freedom of Access Act (FOAA) public access officer. During Professional Municipal Clerks Week, May 3 to May 9, I encourage you to reflect of the great work done by your municipal clerks.
With an executive order dated April 10, Governor Janet Mills has moved the Primary Election in Maine to July 14, 2020. Caribou City Clerk Jayne R. Farrin is encouraging voters to consider signing up for an absentee ballot. You may request a ballot from the maine.gov website, download an application to submit to the Caribou City Clerk, or visit the office (when it reopens), or you can call and request one by mail. Absentee ballots become available 30 days prior to the election and are mailed daily as requests come in. There are resources available online at the City of Caribou website under the "departments" tab. Select the "city clerk" page. For information, call the clerk's office at: 207-493-3324 option 2.
Are you wondering if you missed the deadline to file for a Homestead Exemption? If you qualified for the exemption on April 1, you can still apply. In a March 31 executive order, Gov. Mills extended the deadline to file for many exemptions. Contact your municipality for a form (they are same all over the state of Maine) and complete, sign and submit soon because we are trying to process all paperwork for the annual tax commitment. If the office has sent paperwork to you requesting more information on business equipment, exemptions, data verification or to follow up on permits, please complete and return the forms as soon as possible.
Social distancing has made me really appreciate the citizens of Caribou. I've missed having taxpayers stop by with questions and I look forward to welcoming you back into the office soon. Until then please give me a call at 207-493-5961 if you have questions about tax assessment or building and other permits. I am grateful every day to be in your service.
Penny Thompson is Caribou's tax assessor and building official. She can be reached at 493-5961 or pthompson@cariboumaine.org.

AUGUSTA, Maine -- Black and African-American people account for 5 percent of coronavirus cases in which racial information is disclosed in Maine despite making up only 1.6 percent of the population, suggesting that racial disparities seen in other states also exist here.
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention released data on the race and ethnicity of individuals infected with coronavirus on Wednesday. Racial information is available for 76 percent of the state's 1,056 coronavirus cases as of that day. It was released for the first time on Wednesday after a request from the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, though a spokesperson for the agency said the data preparation had begun prior to the organization's request.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Maine CDC Director Nirav Shah has cautioned that individuals diagnosed with the virus are not required to provide full demographic information to the state. Among cases where information on race is available, black and African-American Mainers make up 5 percent of cases, more than three times what would be expected given by their population share in the state.
The data provided by the Maine CDC only show the racial breakdown of coronavirus cases, not of deaths in the state. The racial breakdown mirrors some trends seen in other states.
[iframe url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2179179/embed" width="600" height="450"]
Shah said Thursday that the representation shown in the data was "deeply concerning." He said that several factors likely contributed to the disparity, including that racial minorities are more likely to work in frontline jobs and less likely to have access to health insurance. Another report by the Kaiser Family Foundation earlier this month cited similar issues at the likely causes of racial disparities nationally.
The Maine CDC has also reached out to representatives of immigrant communities, Shah said, citing the need to "remove roadblocks" to health care access for new Mainers.
An analysis by American Public Media earlier this week based on states that had already released racial data found that the mortality rate for black residents from coronavirus was 2.8 times as high as that of white residents. In some states, such as Kansas and Wisconsin, black Americans were seven times more likely to die from coronavirus than their white counterparts.
"Some people think Maine is exempt from racial disparities or racial equity issues because we have less people of color than other states," said Kathy Kilrain del Rio, who directs health care advocacy at Maine Equal Justice. "There is no place that is exempt from these issues."
Geographic differences within Maine might explain some of the disparities, but not the full extent. Black Mainers are mostly concentrated in Androscoggin and Cumberland counties, where they respectively make up 4.4 percent and 3.1 percent of the population, according to census data. Cumberland County has been hit hardest by the virus, accounting for 44 percent of known cases and half of deaths in the state as of Thursday.
The racial disparities seen with coronavirus are an extension of existing inequities in Maine, Kilrain del Rio said, noting that people living in poverty or who lacked health insurance were more likely to develop health conditions that might then make them more susceptible to the virus. Many of those people also held frontline jobs as grocery store workers or direct care aides, she said.
"We know that our public health is only as strong as the most vulnerable people in our community," Kilrain del Rio said. "As long as we ignore certain people in our community, we're all more at risk. So thinking about these disparities, thinking about equity protects all of us."

AUGUSTA, Maine -- Some Mainers who have seen their previous unemployment claims denied will automatically get benefits through a new federal effort launching on Friday, though workers will initially receive the minimum benefit in an effort to expedite the program.
Self-employed workers whose state unemployment claims were denied due to insufficient income will automatically get benefits through the federally funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, Maine Department of Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said Thursday.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Many of the 7,000 workers whose claims were denied through an expedited process last week would likely fall into that category of workers automatically enrolled, Fortman said. Self-employed workers who have not yet applied for unemployment will need to fill out an initial claim, and all workers still have to file weekly certifications.
The program was created through a $2.2 trillion federal stimulus package passed in late March, though it took Maine a month to set up the system to administer it. Benefits through the program are retroactive to when individuals were forced to stop working due to the coronavirus outbreak. The minimum benefit is set at $172, half of the state's average regular unemployment benefit. Workers also receive an additional $600 for weeks starting April 4 through another federal program.
The department will start paying the minimum benefit to eligible individuals without reviewing their earnings history in order to get money into the hands of workers faster, Fortman said. Workers will then be asked to provide documentation of their previous income in the coming weeks, and their benefits will be adjusted retroactively if they qualify for additional funds, she said.
The department is asking applicants to file in staggered times on Friday morning, based alphabetically on last names. The department does not know how many of the state's roughly 70,000 self-employed workers have been affected by the virus and will be applying for the program, Fortman said.
The Maine Department of Labor has at times struggled with high call volume as record numbers of people have filed for unemployment over the past six weeks. Fortman noted that the office had hired an additional 100 claims specialists to answer the phones, but she encouraged workers to make phone calls only as a "last resort."

Here are the answers to your questions on the reopening of Maine's economy

Maine's response to the coronavirus began in March with a series of orders that brought the activity of many businesses to a halt. Some of those businesses reopened on May 1 while complying with a series of ever-changing orders amid Gov. Janet Mills' phased reopening plan.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
The Bangor Daily News asked readers to provide their questions about the reopening. We will continue to answer them on a rolling basis as we report on them and more come in. If you have a question, you can ask it here.
How is everyone supposed to obtain a cloth mask? -- Edward, Veazie
"Cloth face coverings" is the proper term here. In an order that took effect on May 1, Mills told Mainers to wear those coverings -- which must cover your nose and mouth -- in places where it is hard to keep your distance from others, such as stores, busy outdoor spaces and public transportation.
The Bangor Daily News has published a guide to making them yourself. One of the easiest methods requires a T-shirt and rubber bands. You can also use a bandana, neck cover or a scarf. Almost everyone has some of that stuff lying around the house.
When will short-term rentals to folks from out of state be allowed?
July, it seems, though the lodging provisions under Mills' different sets of orders are confusing and somewhat onerous and the industry is signaling that they may be changed. They do, however, apply to most types of lodging evenly, from hotels to AirBnbs and short-term rentals.
In early April, the governor suspended most lodging operations. Her reopening plan limits lodging opens up lodging as of June to Maine residents and people who have met a 14-day quarantine requirement. Access to lodging would expand further into July.
HospitalityMaine, an industry group, has reported that it has gotten more clarification on those orders, telling members in a Friday message that they can book reservations for Maine residents only in June and all visitors in July and onward. It also said the phases could be shortened by the Mills administration, so stay tuned for that.
I work at a supermarket where most of my coworkers and many of our customers have not been wearing face coverings. As of Friday, will it be up to my employer to ensure that any customer coming in the store wears a facial covering and any employee working in the store wears one? -- Robert, Calais
Enforcement is a gray area. The order accompanying Mills' economic reopening plan announced this week requires Mainers to wear cloth face coverings in public settings where social distancing is difficult as of Friday. Grocery stores are such a place.
The order, however, does not mention enforcement of such a standard. Christine Cummings, the executive director of the Maine Grocers and Food Producers Association, said on Thursday afternoon that she expected further guidance on the issue from the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development.
To re-open a business, I heard or read you need a sticker from the state. Is that true and if so, how do I get that? -- Terry, Belfast
You don't need a badge, but you do need to follow state regulations. To re-open, business owners must follow public health guidelines available on the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development's website. The site includes different checklists for different industries, and business owners must fill out an online form committing to adhering to the measures for their industry.
Businesses that complete that form are eligible to receive a sticker or badge in the future, though the department is still developing what that badge would look like. Filling out the form is the necessary prerequisite; the badge is not. A retail industry official described the badge as "more of a marketing tool" to instill consumer confidence.
Friends want to come up to a camp on Lake Arrowhead for two weeks. What are the quarantine implications? -- Real St. Pierre, Limerick
It is allowed, though gatherings of more than 10 people are banned in Maine. Mills issued an order in early April requiring people to quarantine for two weeks if they are residents traveling back to Maine or non-residents traveling to the state.
However, travelers and their hosts would be wise to consider recommendations from the U.S. CDC to practice social distancing by staying at least six feet from people outside their household and not to gather in groups.
I am wondering if it is now OK to gather in small groups with friends and family as long as less than 10 people are together. If so, is this allowed in homes or private properties, only outdoors, or at local businesses that are open? -- Melinda, Albion
The same answer as above mostly applies. These types of gatherings are allowed on private property. Restaurants are closed to dine-in customers and many other stores that are open are asking families to leave shopping to one household member, so there are not many good places for even small public gatherings at this point.
For most people, holding these gatherings is a matter of whether they are wise. The CDC says everyone should limit both indoor and outdoor contact with people outside their households, especially given that people can spread the virus without knowing they are sick.
If you live in Berwick and shop in New Hampshire, must you quarantine for 14 days when finished? -- Joseph, Fort Lauderdale, Florida
No. Mills' quarantine order exempted people engaging in essential services as defined in an earlier order. That includes essential tasks like grocery shopping. On the other side of the border, Gov. Chris Sununu has urged people coming to New Hampshire for extended stays to self-quarantine, but that does not apply to day trips for essentials or family visits.
When can Airbnbs open? If it is not until July 1, can I get my refund back for a June booking? -- Gail, York
Maybe. Airbnb's coronavirus policy allows hosts and guests to cancel bookings made before March 14 with a check-in date before May 31 without penalty and receive a refund or credit. For later bookings, the company says that usual cancellation policies apply. Some hosts are offering full or partial refunds, but they're not required to right now.

The Portland Symphony Orchestra canceled its concerts through June due to coronavirus concerns and asked ticket-holders to donate the price of their tickets to the orchestra as a donation, the Portland Press Herald reports.
In all, the PSO has canceled 15 concerts since the pandemic began. PSO Executive Director Carolyn Nishon announced the new round of cancellations following updated guidelines from the governor's office regarding physical distancing.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
"Through all of this, we have been heartened and inspired by the support and resilience of our community and are confident we can navigate these challenges together. Until we see each other again, stay safe and be well," Nishon wrote in an email to the orchestra community.
During the pandemic, the PSO has used its digital tools to engage with its audience and, on May 14, will host what it is calling its "Solo Together Un-Gala" to replace its annual fundraising wine dinner. The online auction will include performances by PSO musicians and commentary from Music Director Eckart Preu. The PSO is asking for donations of $50 per person or $100 per couple.

The vast majority of Mainers support continued restrictions on businesses and personal travel even as 19 percent of respondents said they or someone in their household had been laid off as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a new poll.
The survey of nearly 320 Maine residents was conducted between April 16 and 26 by the COVID-19 Consortium, a group of researchers from Northeastern, Harvard and Rutgers universities, as part of a 50-state survey.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Maine residents, in line with national trends, mostly supported maintaining current social distancing restrictions moving forward, the poll found. Ninety-four percent "strongly" or "somewhat" approved of government measures over the next 30 days asking people to stay home, while 88 percent said they supported requiring most businesses to stay closed and 92 percent supported keeping schools closed.
At a national level, there were not significant differences on maintaining social distancing measures between people of different education levels or income brackets. There were differences, however, along partisan lines, with Republicans being more likely than Democrats to call for an economic reopening.
In Maine, only 6 percent of those surveyed said the country's economy should be reopened immediately. Seventy-four percent thought it should not be opened for at least 4 weeks, with 26 percent saying the country should wait at least eight weeks.
Respondents in Maine also said they were largely adhering to current public health requirements. Eighty percent said they had been following public health guidelines about avoiding crowded spaces "very closely" and 17 percent said "somewhat closely."
Mask wearing, which will be mandatory in Maine starting Friday, was less common, however; with 48 percent said they followed guidelines about wearing a mask "very closely." Eighteen percent said "somewhat closely," while 14 percent said "not closely" and 20 percent said "not at all." Those behaviors might stem from a fear of contracting the virus or giving it to someone else.
Seventy-two percent of Maine respondents said they were "very" or "somewhat" concerned about personally contracting coronavirus, while 82 percent said they were concerned about a family member getting it. Support for public health measures came in spite of concern about the economic effects of the virus.
Overall, 60 percent of Mainers said they were "very" or "somewhat" concerned about experiencing financial hardships due to the virus. One third of Maine respondents had been affected by layoffs, with 19 percent saying they or someone in their household had been laid off or lost a job, while 14 percent saw a cut in pay or hours.
As with a Critical Insights poll published earlier this month, Mainers indicated that they trusted the state government to respond to the crisis better than its federal counterpart. Forty percent said the federal government was not taking the outbreak seriously enough, while 54 percent said it was reacting about right.
Only 8 percent said the state government was not taking the outbreak seriously enough, while 80 percent approved of its response and 12 percent thought the state was overreacting.
Gov. Janet Mills remained popular, with 72 percent "somewhat" or "strongly" approving of the Democrat's handling of the outbreak, compared with only 45 percent for President Donald Trump among Mainers. The poll was completed before she announced a phased-in reopening plan on Tuesday that would keep many businesses closed into the summer.
Nearly nine in 10 Maine respondents trusted the state government to handle the coronavirus outbreak "some" or "a lot," while only 60 percent said they trusted the White House, 53 percent said they trusted Trump and 52 percent trusted Congress. Fifty-four percent said they trusted former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.
Hospitals and doctors were by far the most trusted group, with 76 percent of Maine respondents saying they had "a lot" of trust while only 2 percent said "not much" or "not at all."
Those surveyed in Maine showed less trust in media organizations, with 45 percent saying they trusted the news media "some," while 10 percent said "a lot" and 34 percent said "not much" or "not at all." Nonetheless, 83 percent of respondents felt informed about the state of the outbreak and 95 percent said steps they could take to protect themselves.
Mainers also did not have full confidence in their neighbors, the poll found. Half of respondents said ordinary people were not taking the outbreak seriously enough, while 25 percent said they were reacting about right and 15 percent said they were overreacting.

A number of Maine dentists had been expecting to reopen their practices at the beginning of May when Gov. Janet Mills made her announcement about a four-phase reopening of the state's economy. But after a week of confusing messages, they are now allowed to provide emergency treatment only.
As recently as Monday, the day before Gov. Janet Mills announced her administration's four-phase reopening plan, the Maine Dental Association told members it "may be technically possible" to reopen for normal business once the governor's stay-at-home order expired May 1.
"The message there was we're back, we're working again," said Dr. Brad Rand, a Brewer dentist who is the Maine Dental Association's president. "As more details have come out, it has been much more yellow light caution than green light go."
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
On Tuesday, Rand told association members in another message that he and Executive Director Angela Westhoff had met with Mills' senior health policy advisers and asked them to allow dentists to resume routine operations starting May 1.
Then, on Wednesday, Economic and Community Development Commissioner Heather Johnson said in a press briefing that dentists were among those health care providers who could reopen during the first phase of the state's economic restart to perform elective procedures.
"Dentists are part of the elective medical procedures that are part of phase one," she said, without providing further detail.
Yet the department later posted guidelines to its website that deferred to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on dental practices. The CDC recommends that dental care be limited to emergencies only "during this period of the pandemic."
[Mainers want haircuts and stylists want work, but salons aren't all opening as restrictions lift]
Rand, who had planned to reopen in mid-May, sent an urgent message to members early Thursday warning them that only emergency care would be allowed during the reopening's first phase.
"The result for Maine dentists has been disappointing," Rand said. "At least for our industry, the details were not there in order to be able to make good, informed decisions for the dentists and dental practices."
The conflicting messages about dentistry over the past week underscore the concerns among businesses as the state shifts from a broad economic shutdown to the first phase of the Mills administration's reopening plan.
Dr. Jonathan Shenkin, a pediatric dentist in Augusta, had also been preparing to reopen his practice in mid-May. He spent thousands of dollars procuring personal protective equipment including N-95 masks, installing protective barriers in the office area and putting in an air filtration system, he said. Now, he's uncertain when his practice will reopen.
"This is the time where we need to have leaders that are capable of putting plans together based on stakeholder involvement and being able to implement those plans," Shenkin said. "And right now, you're seeing disarray, disorganization and lack of leadership in putting [a plan] together, not just dentistry.
"If stage one is so disorganized and they're going to spend all their time now trying to fix stage one, how are they going to get prepared for stage two that starts in June?" he said.
[Here are the answers to your questions on the reopening of Maine's economy]
A Maine Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman didn't address confusion over dental practices in a response to questions from the BDN.
The Maine Board of Dental practice, which is the licensing authority for dentists and dental hygienists, acknowledged the confusing messages from various agencies in draft guidance published on its website Thursday.
In its own message published last week, on April 23, the board said that licensed dental professionals who treated patients for elective dental procedures during the coronavirus emergency risked engaging in unprofessional conduct.
"So long as CDC guidelines continue to recommend limiting dental treatment to 'emergency visits only,' as they currently do, the Board expects dental practitioners to continue to limit their practices to emergency and urgent care," the board said in the draft guidance, which is the subject of an emergency meeting Thursday afternoon.
The licensing board's statement on April 23 put hygienists whose employers had decided to resume routine procedures in the difficult place of violating licensing guidelines by going back to work or potentially losing employment, said Clarke, the hygienists' association president.
Working within inches of patients' mouths and performing procedures that cause saliva to spray put those in dental professions at especially high risk for contracting the coronavirus. The coronavirus has been shown to survive in aerosols for hours and on some surfaces for days, according to the U.S. CDC.
[Read the timeline for reopening Maine's economy]
A dental hygienist in Hancock County said she's scared of the potential exposure to the coronavirus from performing dental procedures. Unless patient safety and personal protective equipment guidelines are spelled out, she said, she does not feel comfortable resuming routine dental procedures.
"If I had the proper PPE and systems in place I would go back," she said. "If I do not, I won't be returning, whether that is unfortunately walking away from a job or getting fired. We swore an oath as health care professionals to first do no harm. And there's no price that is worth more than that."
Shenkin, the pediatric dentist in Augusta, said Maine should have followed guidelines issued by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which advise states with low rates of COVID-19 to allow facilities to provide for nonemergency care, over U.S. CDC guidelines.
"There are parts of Maine that are well beyond ready to open up, including for comprehensive dental care," he said. "There are people that spent a lot of money in preparation for reopening the next couple of days, and now they're stuck with all these bills because of poor planning by the administration."

Texto completo: CARIBOU, Maine -- Northern Maine Development Commission and Maine Procurement Technical Assistance Center will partner to offer an online virtual workshop shop from 9 to 10 a.m. on Wednesday, May 13, for all small businesses interested in expanding their business through government contracts.
The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program now covers the entire Aroostook County and offers local businesses a competitive edge for federal awards.
Dana Delano, procurement counselor for Maine PTAC, will hold the online webinar via Zoom to offer details on the HubZone program and how to become certified.
"Aroostook County in a qualified HUBZone," said Bob Clark, executive director at NMDC.
"We understand the challenges Aroostook County small businesses are facing and we want area businesses to understand the opportunity and benefits that the HUBZone program presents. This program can help stimulate the region's economy by getting federal contracts flowing to eligible small businesses," Clark said.
The Historically Underutilized Business Zone program was enacted into law as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The program encourages economic development in historically underutilized business zones through the establishment of preferences. Those preferences to HUBZone-qualified companies include competitive and sole-source contracting, 10 percent price evaluation preference in full and open contract competitions, as well as subcontracting opportunities.
The federal government has a goal of awarding 3 percent of all dollars for federal prime contracts to HUBZone-certified small businesses.
The workshop is free and open to any business interested in learning more about this program.
To attend, RSVP to Delano by emailing ddelano@nmdc.org. He will send you a link to the free Zoom meeting.
Zoom meetings can be attended by computer or phone, and participants do not have to have a Zoom account to attend.

The harness racing season has been stopped dead in its tracks by coronavirus restrictions, leaving race tracks in Bangor and Scarborough closed for the foreseeable future, WABI-TV reports.
Hollywood Casino General Manager Austin Muchemore said that Bangor Raceway will remain closed until "it is approved by the state to re-open."
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Scarborough Downs Harness Race Track of Scarborough will also remain closed until cleared to resume business, according to its website.
The season typically runs from May to December in Maine. No cases of horses infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus, the animal strain of COVID-19, have been reported, Maine Harness Racing Commission Executive Director Henry Jennings said.
A "substantial number of unofficial laboratory tests" in several countries have found cases of horses having the illness, including those who were exhibiting respiratory symptoms. The tests were run as part of efforts to "fine tune" a commercial veterinary test for the virus, Jenning said in a statement.
Hollywood Casino has been closed since March 16, when the virus began to draw widespread attention.

Rockland leaders will consider turning their downtown into an open-air market to comply with coronavirus social-distancing restrictions and to give businesses a better chance of surviving the pandemic, according to the Courier Gazette.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Under a proposal the city council will consider on Monday, a section of Main Street would be closed to all but emergency-vehicle traffic from June 1 through June 30. Businesses in the downtown zone would use sidewalks to display merchandise provided that they practice social distancing. Restaurants would serve food and alcohol on the sidewalk, and a sufficient travel way along Main Street would be maintained to allow for emergency vehicles.
The proposal would allow the city manager to close Main Street, from Park Street to Summer Street. Rockland Main Street Inc. Executive Director David Gogel said he is really in favor of the proposal.
"This would be a great thing for downtown businesses," Gogel said.
He said the idea is not to attract large crowds but to allow businesses additional space and be able to meet the physical distancing requirement.
Rockland businesses took a heavy blow when organizers of the Maine Lobster Festival of Rockland announced Wednesday the cancellation of the event this year due to coronavirus. The coastal town was among the first handful in the state to declare states of emergency in March. Many downtown businesses have been closed while others have turned to curbside delivery to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Gogel said downtown businesses are looking for additional details concerning Gov. Janet Mills' plan to reopen businesses, the Courier Gazette reported.

UMPI nursing lab project out to bid

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- The University of Maine at Presque Isle plans to transform an old lecture hall into a state-of-the-art Nursing lab through its new Folsom Hall renovation project, which went out to bid last week. The update to the space on the first floor of UMPI's major classroom building will allow for a 7-bed healthcare lab with full connectivity and a wide range of simulation capabilities.
The project will support UMPI's collaboration with the University of Maine at Fort Kent, which has delivered its Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program on the UMPI campus since Fall 2018. With this expansion, and with both campuses' continuing efforts to help address the statewide nursing cliff, officials hope to have between 100 and 120 Nursing students working through the UMFK BSN program on the UMPI campus by 2021.
"We're taking a very static space, currently configured as a stadium seating-style lecture hall and turning it into a space that is flexible, modular, and focused on our commitment to addressing Maine's workforce challenges, specifically in the healthcare sector," UMPI President Ray Rice said. "We're pleased to note that this project will be done utilizing bond funds approved by voters in 2018. These funds, and the project they support, allow our campus to help prepare more job-ready graduates in the career fields where rural Maine most needs workers, like nurses--important now more than ever given the current public health emergency."
Bids will be opened on May 7. Construction is slated to begin May 18 and be completed by Aug. 28. This renovation project was designed by engineering firm WBRC of Bangor.
The renovation project will involve raising the floor and lowering the ceiling in the space to level it with the rest of the ground floor of Folsom Hall and make it ADA compliant. The space will be outfitted with sustainable fixtures and lighting and include an infrastructure upgrade for air quality.
"Through the voter-approved bond, we're now able to meet statewide, local, and regional needs while addressing an area in our facility that was no longer matching up with the way we're teaching and interacting with our students," Ben Shaw, UMPI's Chief Business Officer, said. "That space was based on a 1960s design, with teaching in a lecture format as the model. Our classes today are much more hands-on and dynamic, so updating the space in this way is really going to set our Academic programs up for success."
Once completed, the 1,800-square-foot lab will include two learning areas. There will be a 3-bed simulation room complete with cameras and a control room so faculty can record students completing activities in the space, play back the video for observation and analysis, and provide feedback. In the other half of the room, there will be a highly reconfigurable 4-bed Nursing lab, and classroom area with desks and chairs, for faculty to instruct higher level nursing skills. The space could be turned into anything from a simulated pediatric floor to a Nursing station depending on the day's lesson.
Each hospital bed in the specialized instruction space will be set up with a bedside table, overbed table, and related equipment, including a needle disposal system, glove dispensing system, oxygen, IV pole, and a privacy curtain. These hospital suites are designed so a human patient simulator mannequin or an actual UMPI student could occupy them for scenarios and simulations.
"When you pull the curtain, a student would not know the difference between working in a hospital and working in this lab," Barbara Blackstone, UMPI's Dean of the College of Professional Programs, explained. "This Nursing lab is really going to give our students the chance to develop skills through scenario-based learning and better prepare for the field experiences they'll complete in local hospitals."
While the new Nursing lab will serve as a learning space primarily for junior and senior Nursing students, the existing Nursing lab on the first floor of Pullen Hall will be based more around the curriculum for freshmen and sophomore Nursing students.
"Critical thinking is a complex skill for students to attain but a necessary function of successful nursing practice," Dr. Erin Soucy, UMFK Dean of Undergraduate Nursing, said. "Nurses assimilate a large amount of patient information and then make inferences, prioritize patient care needs, and creatively problem solve. Teaching nursing students through simulation improves critical thinking, psychomotor dexterity, and problem solving skills. We are so happy to have a state of the art simulation lab for our students on the UMPI campus."
An especially exciting aspect of the Nursing lab is how it can serve as a learning space for other academic programs, such as Social Work, Biology/Pre-Med, Exercise Science, MLT, and the Physical Therapist Assistant program, Blackstone said. For each of these programs, the space will allow faculty to provide students with real-world, scenario-based and simulation learning opportunities as part of their coursework.
"The most important thing is having a space for the faculty to be able to simulate scenarios for their students, making the experiences feel as real as possible," Blackstone said. "This new space is going to provide a wonderful opportunity for Nursing and other inter-professional healthcare programs."

BELFAST, Maine -- The Maine Center for Disease Control is investigating whether the death of a 42-year-old firefighter from Waldo County is connected to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, confirmed Thursday that an investigation is underway.
"Our team of epidemiologists and disease detectives is starting the process of looking into it," he said.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Shah did not give details about the firefighter or the situation. But an online fundraiser that was started on Thursday said that the volunteer firefighter, Lieutenant Harold "Eddie" Moore, Jr., of Jackson, died on Tuesday night.
Moore's wife worked as a CNA at The Commons at Tall Pines in Belfast, which has suffered a severe outbreak of COVID-19, in which 11 residents have died. She was one of the 11 staff members who tested positive for the disease, according to the GoFundMe website, and had to be quarantined at home.
"While they tried hard to keep Ed from getting it, he ended up catching the virus as well," the fundraising page said.
Moore's symptoms had been starting to slowly dissipate, according to the fundraising website. He responded to a fire at a Jackson residence on Tuesday, according to a report from News Center Maine. Later in the evening, he suffered cardiac arrest and died at his home. It was the first Maine line-of-duty firefighter death this year, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.
Hans Albee, Brooks deputy fire chief, also helped fight that fire. He said that after firefighters from his town understood the situation with Moore, they have all individually been in contact with the Maine CDC to get guidelines for their safety and the safety of their families, which they are abiding by.
"What happened to this man is a tragedy to him and his fire department and his community," Albee said Thursday night. "I'm thankful to the Maine CDC for reaching out to work with us and help us to respond appropriately."

Despite the announcement of a statewide plan to gradually lift coronavirus restrictions, the City of Augusta will lay off 32 workers by the end of May to balance revenues shortfalls and increases in pandemic-inspired spending, the Kennebec Journal reported.
Some city employees have already been laid off as part of a plan that will include 15 full-time and 17 permanent part-time employees. Most of them work at city facilities that are largely closed due to the pandemic. They include the Augusta Civic Center, where most public events have been canceled, along with Lithgow Public Library and the child care bureau at Buker Community Center.
Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday outlined a gradual plan to lift coronavirus-related restrictions. It does not appear to immediately include the reopening of large venues such as the civic center but could embrace the library and community center. Under her plan, restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people will continue through May, with the threshold increasing to 50 for June, July and August.

With the pandemic causing the cancellation of 44 civic center events from March to July, the facility anticipates being in debt by $400,000 by the end of June. The total could reach $700,000 by September, center director Earl Kingsbury said last week.
The city will use its general fund to cover the shortfall. When the civic center reopens, its leaders will explore limiting the size of crowds until the public is more comfortable with attending large gatherings.
Another death and 39 new coronavirus cases were reported on Thursday. There have been 1,095 confirmed cases across all of Maine's counties, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That's up from 1,056 on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, Portland, Westbrook and South Portland furloughed hundreds of municipal employees -- mostly part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, but also library, community service and recreation workers -- due to revenue declines, according to the Portland Press Herald.

Augusta City Manager William Bridgeo on Wednesday praised the workers being laid off when he explained the city's plan in a memo to city councilors, the Kennebec Journal reported.
"We are blessed with a wonderful, dedicated workforce and the steps being taken to be financially responsible are painful ones," he wrote.
City officials plan two furlough days for nearly all city employees before the fiscal year ends June 30, one on May 18 and another in late June.
Revenue shortfalls are expected to include more than $550,000 in excise taxes paid on vehicles, $200,000 in property taxes and the civic center losses. The increased expenditures created by the pandemic include cost overruns of about $141,000 for public safety and $136,000 in general assistance, some of which might be reimbursed by state or federal funds, according to the Kennebec Journal.

The coronavirus outbreak has prompted record-setting unemployment claims in Maine and nationwide that the state has struggled to keep up with amid delays in implementing new programs for self-employed workers who can apply for benefits on Friday.
We have heard of snags for other workers, including those who have exhausted the 26-week limit on traditional unemployment benefits but should be eligible for an extension and others who have already used benefits in the past year.

Texto completo: Fox News host Tucker Carlson interrupted a frustrated Maine businessman who tried to give out the personal cellphone number of Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills.
Rick Savage, a restaurant owner from Bethel, Maine, was on Carlson's show to discuss his outrage toward Maine's stay-at-home order as the state continues to have one of the smallest coronavirus outbreaks in the nation. Savage, who donated thousands of meals throughout the pandemic, explained why he was going to open his restaurant in protest of Mills's executive order.
At the end of the interview, Savage urged viewers to call Mills's personal phone to complain about the measure.
"I really appreciate, Tucker, coming on, and I hope all of these restaurants will be able to open," Savage said. "One further thing, I would love to share Janet Mills's cellphone number with everybody, so they can give her a call directly because she's got all the phones shut down. You can’t even call. It goes to voicemail. The lawmakers can’t even call her. They have to email her. She gets back to them, 'Oh, thanks for that, I'll get back to you soon.' Here's her phone number. It's 207…"
Tucker drowned him out, saying, "Wait, wait, wait. How about this? I may have cut you off. If our viewers are interested, it's Sunday Riverbrew Pub in Bethel, Maine. Call and ask for a Rick Savage, and he'll do it."
Savage said he was hoping to "start a revolution" to get Maine to reopen businesses.
As of Thursday, Maine had 1,095 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 53 related deaths.

Betsy Wyeth, 1921-2020

Texto completo: There was a time, not so long ago, when the idea that Andrew Wyeth's reputation might recover among critics and art historians seemed unlikely. By the 1960s and ’70s, the high tide of abstract expressionism in America, his status as a realist master of austere portraits and haunted landscapes was replaced by the consensus that his paintings were formulaic illustrations for mass consumption, designed to appeal to rich collectors.
To be sure, there was a kernel of truth in the criticism. Wyeth was the son of N.C. Wyeth, one of the great illustrators of the early 20th century, and had a sharp commercial sense. Andrew spent his long artistic lifetime repeatedly depicting his native habitats of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and the southeast coast of Maine, far from the salons and galleries of New York. Worst of all, his paintings — magic realism mixed with surreal elements and abstraction — were always popular, sometimes spectacularly so, with the general public. And yet, by the time of his death in 2009, Wyeth's reputation as a modern master, respected as well as beloved, had been restored.
Part of the reason is that Wyeth really was a great artist. But the other part is that his long career was sustained, as well as largely supported and directed, by his wife of seven decades, Betsy Wyeth, who died last week at age 98 in Chadds Ford. Betsy Wyeth was Andrew Wyeth's artistic muse and partner, as well as his shrewd manager: The commercial success that so disturbed art critics owed something to her guidance, her subtle and persistent influence on her husband's work, and her organizational and financial skills.

This is all the more impressive given the facts of her life before she met her future husband in 1939. The daughter of a Buffalo newspaper editor who owned a vacation home in Maine, Betsy Wyeth (then Betsy James) had no formal art training when, at age 17, her father introduced her to 20-year-old Andrew Wyeth, whose family's summer residence was nearby.

Andrew Wyeth was already an artist of repute — he had sold every painting at his first New York gallery show two years earlier — but their meeting would prove decisive. She introduced him to a local brother and sister, Alvaro and Christina Olson, who inhabited a squalid farmhouse at the crest of a barren hill. Betsy was curious to observe Andrew's reaction to the impoverished and slightly forbidding pair she had befriended. Alvaro Olson barely managed to subsist as a farmer, and Christina Olson was paralyzed from the waist down but disdained the use of a wheelchair. Andrew Wyeth seemed to have passed the test: They were married in 1940.

In subsequent years, Andrew Wyeth would depict the Olsons in innumerable works. But his mysterious egg-tempera vision of Christina Olson crawling up the hill toward her farmhouse was not only modeled by but was also titled by Betsy, Christina's World (1948). It was purchased the following year by the Museum of Modern Art. It remains Andrew Wyeth's best-known and probably most admired work.

In that sense, the partnership of Andrew and Betsy Wyeth was a practical as well as artistic arrangement. It was Betsy Wyeth who persuaded Andrew Wyeth to follow his instincts by resisting his illustrator father's professional advice. And it was Betsy Wyeth whose counsel and domestic competence, raising two sons, paying bills and taxes, organizing shows, compiling catalogs, that freed her husband to flourish as an artist.

The lone crisis, if it was one, in their long collaboration was played out in public. In 1985, Andrew revealed that, during the previous 15 years, he had secretly produced and concealed a series of paintings, including several nude studies, of a young German-born nurse neighbor named Helga Testorf. The news became a media sensation, the "Helga" paintings were unveiled in a blockbuster show at Washington's National Gallery of Art, and the backstory suggested trouble in the Wyeth marriage.

Betsy Wyeth responded in characteristic fashion. When asked what had inspired her husband's behavior, she replied, “Love” — and then patiently organized the exhibition catalog.

Miss Maine’s museums? You can still explore online

Texto completo: Maine is renowned for its arts and cultural offerings. Many organizations have found ingenious ways to engage audiences, from virtual tours to special performances. And Maine Public just announced the creation of a Maine Museum Portal to highlight exhibitions across the state at www.mainepublic.org/post/maine-publics-maine-museum-portal.
Here’s a showcase of four organizations that offer coronavirus workarounds.
A bigger museum coming for kids
<img class="size-medium wp-image-16827470" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/children-museum-043020-300x191.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="191" />
The Children’s Museum & Theatre of Maine exists to inspire discovery and imagination through exploration and play. And it’s growing: In early February, the museum and theatre announced the public launch of a $14-million campaign to fund construction of its new facility at Thompson’s Point in Portland. The 30,000-square-foot, three-story museum will be nearly double the size of the former location and feature the 100-seat Maddy’s Theatre, named for philanthropist Madeleine Corson’s mother.
While all in-person programming has been suspended, the museum offers daily online programming, including Facebook livestreaming of programs “At Home Together” (10:30 a.m.) and “Maine Youth Playwriting” (3:30 p.m.). A full schedule is available at www.kitetails.org/online.
In Augusta, a trove of state history
<img class="size-medium wp-image-16827506" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/maine-state-043020-252x300.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="300" />
The Maine State Museum in Augusta is one of the nation’s oldest state-funded museums. Its collections focus on the state’s pre-history, history, and natural science. Permanent exhibits include dioramas of Maine’s animals, birds, and plants in different ecosystems; gems and minerals; archaeological artifacts; and the History of Maine Labor mural painted by Judy Taylor. There’s even a working three-story water-powered woodworking mill. This year the museum focuses on the state’s bicentennial through different shows and exhibits.
Although the museum is closed, you can still take a virtual look at a few of its featured exhibitions’ high points and meet its curator, Angela Goebel-Bain, who shares insights and stories about “Regional Struggle – National Story: Maine’s Path to Statehood.”
Moving images in Bucksport
<img class="size-medium wp-image-16827530" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/film-archives-043020-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" />
This nonprofit archive in Bucksport is dedicated to collecting, preserving, and sharing northern New England’s moving image heritage. Northeast Historic Film includes a three-story vault with 10 million-plus feet of film, a public study center, and the 140-seat Alamo Theater. Among its holdings are Maine home movies, 1936 color footage of Mahatma Gandhi in India by social philanthropist Adelaide Pearson of Blue Hill, and “Alpha Centauri,” a science fiction film made in 1967 by an eighth-grade class in Blue Hill.
The Alamo Theatre is closed until further notice, but its archives are up and operating as the small staff practices social distancing and diligent hygiene in shared spaces. They have set up an area for picking up and dropping off film and video. And when the theater reopens, it will feature a state-of-the-art inductive hearing loop that provides a magnetic, wireless signal, thanks to a grant from MaineCF’s Hancock County Fund.
Tours through time in Castine
<img class="size-medium wp-image-16827582" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/wilson-museum-043020-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" />
The Wilson Museum in Castine opened in 1921 to house geologist Dr. John Howard Wilson’s collection gathered close to home and around the world. The campus has several buildings, including the John Perkins House, where visitors can learn about Colonial Castine and generations of the Perkins family who lived there. The village blacksmith shows what fire can create and the Pump House displays firefighting history.
Even when closed, the museum’s website offers a peek at some of its holdings, including a selection from “Treasures of the Past.”
In addition to sharing a passion for bringing the arts to Mainers of all ages, these four organizations have entrusted their long-term funds to the Maine Community Foundation. As of the beginning of this year, MaineCF manages funds for more than 260 nonprofits totaling nearly $100 million in charitable assets. Organizations from all 16 Maine counties hold agency funds at the community foundation and include public charities, public school districts, religious institutions, and charitable municipal funds. Says Liana Kingsbury, director of MaineCF’s nonprofit agency funds, “We are honored to be a resource for organizations whose collective mission is to improve the quality of life for all Maine people. Stewarding long-term charitable assets and offering access to our pooled investment portfolio is just another way MaineCF partners with nonprofits to achieve this mission.”

Logan Parker, an assistant ecologist and founder of the Maine Nightjar Monitoring Project, will host a virtual webinar, “Nightjars in Maine,” from 1-2 p.m. on Saturday, May 9, presented by the Western Maine Audubon. Please note this is a new date for this previously scheduled event. Instructions for viewing the webinar will be sent by Tuesday, May 5, to those who register. This event is free to the public. To register, visit www.eventbrite.com/e/maine-nightjar-monitoring-webinar-tickets-103102101160.
The annual warbler walk planned for Saturday, May 9, has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.
Attendees will learn about the natural history of Maine’s nightjars, cryptic and nocturnal birds that are more likely to be heard than seen, and the efforts involved in monitoring these fascinating birds throughout the state, from Eliot to Calais, Kennebunk to Baxter State Park. The Maine Nightjar Monitoring Procject is a statewide citizen science project is collecting observations of whip-poor-wills, nighthawks, and other nocturnal birds, some of which are facing widespread declines. The project is currently recruiting volunteers to adopt monitoring routes or simply make observations of nightjars in your own backyard.
Logan Parker lives with his wife in their off-grid cabin in the woods of Central Maine. Logan, a life-long Mainer, earned his master’s degree from Unity College, where he studied Sustainable Natural Resource Management with a focus on biodiversity conservation. He is a birder, naturalist, writer, and wildlife photographer.

<img class="size-full wp-image-16827490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/65EEDD0C-90CA-47F7-899F-98E367AC0A0C_1_201_a.jpeg" alt="" width="733" height="570" />
Dylan Crockett, 12, and Braden Littlefield, 14, each value promoter and boxing trainer Glenn Cugno’s live instructions over the Internet, but the pair miss the busy ambience of the musty, basement gym at the Lewiston Armory.
“I miss the atmosphere of everybody in the gym, seeing everybody almost every day, but with Glenn coaching me from Zoom (Video Communications), it is kind of the same thing, with him yelling at me from couch, though,” Littlefield said.
Littlefield, a freshman lightweight who is hoping to play football for Lawrence High School in the fall, said Cugno’s online training keeps boxers motivated. Before the coronavirus appeared in Maine, Littlefield
<img class="size-full wp-image-16827494" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/574E3C02-C842-4C6F-A9F0-0729A48BE0F3_1_201_a.jpeg" alt="" width="981" height="675" />
made the hour-long drive to the Cugno Boxing club from his home in Benton about six times a week.
“Some kids don’t have the willpower to do it all themselves,” said Littlefield, who checks in with Cugno three or four times a week for a half-hour session. “They have to have somebody push them.
“It gives me more motivation that he is there with me trying to coach me than just me doing it on my own.”
Cugno shut down his boxing club on March 12 when COVID-19 shut down businesses across Maine.
“When I open it back up, I am just going to keep it to 10 kids, whatever it is, you know what I mean?” Cugno said.
Cugno got the idea of Zoom conferencing with his boxers from a friend.
“It’s the kids working out and it is like I am right there telling them what to do like ‘get your hands up’ and how to work the bag,” he said. “It is just for the ones that are dying to stay in shape for fighting.
“We were supposed to have fights April 26…and it got cancelled, and all those guys and girls fighting on that show are trying to stay ready, and when businesses open up, we are going to do it (fights),” he said. “We not getting together and doing any sparring. We are just trying to stay safe and keep everybody safe and the videos seemed like the best way to go.”
Cugno offers online exercise regimens as well giving them tips on how they hit the bag and “not get in any bad habits.”
“A lot of times when they start working out on their own, they pick up bad habits because nobody is watching them,” Cugno explained. “I have five or six kids who are really active right now.”
The live video instruction keeps Cugno busy until he is back in the ring with his prized fighters. He also posts exercise regimens for his fighters on his Facebook page.
“I miss being in the gym, too,” he said.”It kind of fills that gym void. It keeps me busy and I can keep an eye on the kids and making sure what they are supposed to be doing.”
Crockett, who attends Windham Middle School, said his grandfather sparked Crockett’s interest in puglism after they watched the “Rocky” movies.
He made two or more trips a week when the Cugno Boxing gym was open, but he is fine with conferencing to train.
“I think it is cool,” Crockett said. “I like it better because of what I do with Glenn, like it is just me and him. It is just attention from him, He was just focusing on me so it made it a lot better. There are not a lot of things to do so it helps you and I get to connect with Glenn.”
But Crockett knows the Zoom conferencing calls are a temporary substitute for the boxing gym.
“I miss everyone there. Everyone is so friendly,” said Crockett, who also runs track and plays soccer. “Like we have a routine and stuff.”

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Starting in fall 2020, a new initiative at the University of Maine at Farmington will allow all out-of-state students to earn a master’s degree or graduate certificate at UMF for in-state graduate tuition. The program is also available to any graduate of a Maine high school who earned an undergraduate degree at an out-of-state college or university.
A first-of-its-kind among Maine colleges and universities, the tuition reduction will save participants nearly $7,000 over the course of a 33-credit master’s degree program at UMF.
UMF President Edward Serna says that by encouraging out-of-state students to remain in Maine to pursue graduate study, the initiative supports a central tenet of the state’s 10-year strategic economic development plan unveiled by Gov. Janet Mills in December 2019 — attract and retain new talent.
Serna says the distinctive initiative is a “win-win for Maine” by helping people realize their professional goals and strengthening the state’s economy through workforce development.
“Academic excellence, affordability, and access have long been hallmarks of a Farmington education,” says Serna, who conceived the initiative. “We’re simply taking these values to the next level by expanding access and opportunity for people seeking skills, knowledge, and professional development through graduate study. I believe the benefits of this program to individuals and the Maine economy will be boundless.”
The new single tuition rate applies to all master’s degree and graduate certificate programs offered at UMF. In addition to a forthcoming new master’s program in counseling, UMF grants master’s degrees in special education, education leadership, and early childhood education.
UMF’s graduate certificate offerings include school administration, assistive technology, English language learning, gifted and talented education, math intervention specialist, math leadership, special education administration, K–8 special education, 7–12 special education, and systems of student support.
For more information on UMF’s graduate study offerings that feature a blended-delivery model of in-class and online instruction, visit www.umf.maine.edu/grad-studies or contact gradstudies@maine.edu / 207-778-7502.

Arrival of Maine’s migrant farm workers in limbo

ELLSWORTH — Even in a good year, farming is an exercise in uncertainty, with farmers at the whim of markets, yields and weather. In a pandemic, growers have to add another worry to the list: Will my workers arrive?
“We don’t have a Plan B,” said Simeon Allen of Allen’s Wild Maine Blueberries. “If we can’t get workers here, we won’t be able to harvest.”
Migrant workers who “follow the crop,” moving from one state to another as the season changes, make up just 5 percent of the hired farm workforce, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But they play an outsize role in food production in seasonal states like Maine, where roughly 18 percent of hired farm labor was made up of migrant workers as of 2012, according to the Maine Department of Labor, a number that has been steadily rising in recent years.
Between 30 and 40 percent of the Allen’s blueberry crop is harvested by hand-rakers over four weeks beginning in August, said Allen.
“We usually bring in about 40 migrant workers, here on work visas; they travel up and down the Eastern Seaboard, starting with crops in Florida,” Allen said.
Allen said a “good majority” of the workers hired by the company are U.S. citizens, while some of the group are in the states on H-2A visas, temporary work visas that allow employers to fill a pre-approved number of positions after proving they are unable to fill them locally.
Those visa applications are typically processed in the first week of April by U.S. consular offices, but with those offices largely shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic, application interviews and other aspects of the process have been delayed.
It’s unclear, for example, whether visas for the 20 workers requested by Cherryfield Foods will be processed in time for their June arrival, said Jorge Acero, director of labor outreach and education for the Maine Department of Labor.
Even some workers who are already in the United States have been stalled. Jeff Beardsworth, who runs Homewood Farm in Blue Hill with his wife, said many of his workers who had been due to arrive in mid-April were in Florida, unable to cross the border into Georgia due to restrictions.
“They’re just stuck,” said Beardsworth, adding that all of them are U.S. citizens who were heading up to help with the strawberry crop. “I’m going to try to run a farm by myself for a while.”
Allen said he’s also heard of workers who would normally head north this time of year stuck in the South. But both men are hoping things will be more normalized by late summer.
“When the blueberries come, we hope things will change,” said Beardsworth. “Right now, it’s strawberries, and they’ve got to be uncovered.” Beardsworth said he’s also unsure whether the local students who help in the summer will be allowed by their families to come work. “I don’t know if families are going to let them out of the house.”
Acero said some farmworkers might also be adhering to recommendations to shelter in place, but that in their absence, Maine farm families are taking on the extra work themselves.
“The families are working extra hard getting the grounds ready and prepping the field,” Acero said.
Although there has been some concern among Mainers about seasonal residents arriving from out of state, Acero said only two farmers have expressed such concerns about migrant workers.
“More than anything, they just want the workers to arrive, no matter what,” he said.
Allen said the company plans to implement “some social distancing and sanitary procedures and requirements for our workers.”
But many farms are simply not set up to allow individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Migrant workers stay in bunkhouses where two to three people share a room, and in larger dormitories where many more people share a larger space. Farmers are being asked to reconfigure them, but that’s not a viable option in most cases, especially with such short notice.
“It’s not possible,” Acero said. “Their bunkhouses are fixed in such a way that there’s no way to separate them.”
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has been closely tracking outbreaks of COVID-19 in congregate living settings, such as long-term care facilities and shelters, where the disease can be particularly difficult to contain. Outbreaks have forced several food processing plants around the nation, including pork processing plants in Iowa and South Dakota, to close after workers fell ill.
Acero asked that farmers understand that migrant workers may need care should one or more of them become ill.
“Please don’t tell the worker they’ve got to leave,” he said.
Farmers with payroll are eligible for the federal Paycheck Protection Program to help cover payroll costs and some may also be eligible for unemployment under the new rules in the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act. Mano en Mano, which advocates for farmworkers out of its offices in Milbridge, has also established the Estamos Aquí Fund to support immigrants and farmworkers in Maine with financial challenges associated with COVID-19, especially those who may not be eligible for government assistance.

Cam Robichaud named coach of Maine Nordiques Prep Academy’s U16 team

Texto completo: html> The Maine Nordiques Prep Academy is coming along.
The Prep Academy will have a U18 and U16 midget hockey teams that will play in the Beast Series. The U16 team will have a familiar face behind the bench as Cam Robichaud, who was the Maine Nordiques associated head coach and director of player advancement and recruitment, will be the U16 head coach.
“It’s something that I am really excited about,” Robichaud said. “Obviously I have been working on having the (North American Hockey League) team here and was a part of the (NAHL) team last season and I will continue to be a part of the (NAHL) team in a capacity of helping recruit and practicing with (Maine Nordiques head coach) Nolan Howe and (assistant head coach and director of player development and wellness) Matt Pinchevsky.”
“It’s a great opportunity with the U16s to get to being a head coach and help build the academy with (Nordiques organization’s general manager) Eric Soltys and Nick Skerlick (the U18 coach),” Robichaud said.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-10093667" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/Cam-Robichaud-20191-300x255.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="255" />
Robichaud has had experience coaching at the midget hockey level with the New Hampshire Junior Monarchs U18 split-season midget team during the 2011-12 season. He also coached at the U14 level with his time with the Monarchs organization before returning to Lewiston to join the L/A Fighting Spirit organization for the 2015-16 season. The Spirit would become the L/A Nordiques for the 2017-18 season.
Robichaud’s role changed because the organization feels he’s one of the best coaches in the business
“It was a move made because of the respect we have for Cam as a coach and wanting those guys to be able to get it done (by getting) taught right from the beginning at the U16 level,” Soltys said. “We thought that was a huge advantage for our kids and for Cam and Nolan. Both are head coaches (and were) in the same spot. To have Cam to have his own show is really going to be good for starters.”
Robichaud will no longer have the official title of director of player recruitment and advancement. He will become the organization’s performance coach.
“I am changing titles besides coaching,” Robichaud said. “I will be the performance coach for the entire organization from the (NAHL team) to the U18 team, to the U16 team and to the youth hockey program. That will (involve being) in the gym with the strength and conditioning (program) and oversee the off-ice developments as well the on-ice developments.”
Robichaud said he will always have a hand in recruiting players to the NAHL team in some fashion.
Soltys said the organization will not fill Robichaud’s position on the NAHL bench, noting that most NAHL benches only have two coaches.
Skerlick comes from the New Jersey Titans organization where he was the head coach of their U18 midget team last year. He’s 26 and from Wayne, New Jersey. He also served as a scout for the Titans NAHL team and the Amarillo Bulls. He had a junior and college hockey playing career.
“He reminds me a lot of myself actually back in his age when I was at Shattack-St. Mary’s where I was around of a bunch of real solid coaches that have a ton of experience,” Soltys said of Skerlick. “I was super excited to be a part of it to learn as much as I could and I see the same thing in Nick. He’s a super strong coach and he wants to get better and he wants to take himself to the highest levels of the game which is admirable.”
Soltys said Skerlick is a great recruiter which is big at the midget hockey to get players to come to a full-season midget program.
Soltys has experience at midget hockey academies as an assistant coach at Shattuck St. Mary’s in Fairbault, Minnesota from 1999-2003 and at Selects Academy at the South Kent School in South Kent, Connecticut as a director of hockey operations from 2009-15.
Soltys said building and moving the Prep Academy from New Jersey started before the coronavirus pandemic even started. This past season, the Prep Academy only had a U18 team which played most of its home games in New Jersey.
“The groundwork has been laid prior to us arriving way back in September when all this initial talk started off,” Soltys said. “(It’s) kind of been laid out for everybody and having experience in this for 20 years now. It made it a lot easier to plan appropriately and deal with this little wrinkle as it came here.”
Soltys said their partner St. Dominic Academy has done a great job
<img class="size-medium wp-image-16837070" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/92699569_108678374137418_8077900217447350272_n-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />
of providing virtual tours of the school to prospective players during the pandemic. The school has also been flexible to the players schedule once the season begins. Nordiques owner Dr. Darryl Antonacci has bought three houses in the Lewiston-Auburn area to house the kids for the upcoming season.
The organization started last week announcing player commitments for both teams on their social media channels. The U18 team will be comprised of players born in 2002 and 2003 for the upcoming season while the U16 team will be comprised of players born in 2004 and 2005.
The players they are bringing in for both teams are looking to play at the Tier I junior hockey level in the United States Hockey League and in the NAHL. The end goal is to play at the Division I college hockey levels.
“Most of the conversations that we have in our recruiting process is about the USHL (Phase I and II) drafts and the (NAHL) draft,” Robichaud said. “These are young players who are very talented but are (a couple years away) from getting to (those) levels. They need to go through the draft process and see who owns their (junior hockey playing) rights and what (those teams) tell them from a junior standpoint if they need more development before junior hockey.”
Another reason why Robichaud is excited to move to the U16 level is because that age group is when players start making their Division I college commitments.
The Prep Academy will take the place of the L/A Nordiques, who played in the North American 3 Hockey League. That team is owned by former Androscoggin Bank Colisee owner Jim Cain and has ceased operations. Cain sold the Colisee to Antonacci last month.
“The NA3HL fan support was outstanding and I think the fans who enjoyed watching that game will enjoy watching the younger kids,” Soltys said. “I think the biggest difference will be the level of skill, speed and pace of the game.”
Both teams will play around 65 games against Beast Series opponents and other midget teams across New England and the country.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
I was headed to the dump the other day and as I passed Cumberland Farms, a voice shouted out “Hey, go back to Connecticut, don’t come to Maine.” As I looked at the fella, I realized it was someone I have known for 20-plus years. My initial response was I chuckled for a few seconds because I was born here, went to high school here and have lived here for 47 years.
The fact that I had a rental car with Connecticut plates because my truck is in the shop, is the only reason I could think for him yelling his comment. I know he didn’t recognize me. Now, I get it about the corona virus, but come on.
I saw him walking on Main Street several days later, stopped and chatted with him a bit. Now here’s a guy who’s 41 years old, lives with his mother, hasn’t worked in at least 11 years, and gets subsistence anyway he can. No, his mother doesn’t need his help, as a matter of fact she has a boyfriend and wishes her son would move out. He is not disabled in any way.
In our conversation I mentioned to him I’m glad those folks from away come to Maine because they leave a lot of money here when they go home. I told him if they own a place here it helps with our property taxes. He reminded me he doesn’t pay property taxes.
I want to believe he is in the minority, but I’ve heard stories over the years these types of rude comments have been going on for years. I guess to some the feeling might be, we want you to come to Maine (Vacationland), spend lots of money, stay a little while, then leave.
Heck, I’ve been to several states in New England driving on my Maine plates and never heard a bad comment. Even got stopped by Massachusetts State Police and when he saw I lived in Norway he said he loved skiing at Sunday River.

AUBURN — Staff readied 50 pounds of onions for onion rings in time for Tabers Restaurant’s first day of the season Friday.
It’s two weeks later than normal, the hours are shorter — four hours instead of nine — and customers are being asked to stay in their cars, but it’s open.
“It’s been a long winter and even longer spring,” owner Dan Hargreaves said.
At the Pampered Pooch in Gray, there’s a new system, starting Friday: They’ll bring a leash to your car and walk your dog inside for a nail trim and a cut while you sit and stay put.
At Orbit Hair Stylings in Lewiston, Richard Stone zipped around Thursday to local pharmacies to buy up as many face masks as he could. Stylists are donning masks, gloves, gowns and goggles come Friday’s reopening. They’ll stay open seven days a week to catch up on all the missed appointments.
“Our guests need us to make them happy and to get them out of the house,” Stone said.
A motley mix of retail businesses — drive-in theaters, marinas, dog groomers, salons, auto dealers, car washes, guide services and golf courses — are allowed to open Friday under Gov. Janet Mills’ four-stage plan to reopen Maine’s economy.
It comes with a slew of built-in precautions and relief that revenue will start back up for some after a long pandemic shutdown. It also comes with some trepidation.
“I really feel like it’s happening maybe a little bit too early, but no salon that doesn’t open is going to stay in business,” Stone said. “You either do it or you die.”
While many local salons announced on social media that they weren’t yet committing to an opening date, one in Lewiston said it had closed for good after eight years.
Tagli salon owners Brad and Ashley Edwards wrote in a lengthy post on Facebook: “We do not foresee a way that our stylists can make a living like they did before, in the new world we live in. … After seven weeks without any revenue, our funds have run out.”
At Reveal Salon and Day Spa, Karena Landry said stylists were deciding for themselves whether to come back to work Friday.
“We’ve had tons of messages (wanting appointments),” she said. “I actually feel really good, I’m glad to reopen.”
At Pampered Pooch, manager and groomer Toni Daniels said the shop was booked out until mid-May.
“Lots of people were sending us messages and calling, ‘Please, please tell us when you’re open again,'” Daniels said. Dog owners are after having “stuff done that we would consider essential — trimming around the face so they can see, trimming around their sanitary area, keep it clean back there, that sort of thing.
“It’s been difficult for all of us, we’re a small business,” she added. “It’s definitely going to be good to get things running again.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-16835786" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/16822138_SJ.BIZopening2P.050120-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />
Bridgton Twin Drive-In Theatre announced that it will open next Friday, May 8, with a six-part plan that includes parking at least 10 feet apart, allowing half as many vehicles and emergency bathroom use only.
“We will be only offering single feature showings,” the company wrote on Facebook. “The major reason is to reduce the need to use restroom facilities.”
Hargreaves said Tabers Restaurant will open from 4 to 8 p.m. for the next several days. He’ll decide on when to expand hours, and when to reopen miniature golf and the driving range, in the coming days and weeks.
The restaurant will employ a car hop-model for the first time with customers placing orders online or on the phone, leaving their vehicle make and model with the order, and staff running the food out.
“The unknown has been the most difficult part of all this,” Hargreaves said. “Once we finally are able to open (Friday), a lot of the questions and a lot of the anxiety will be diminished. I’m expecting to be very busy in that limited amount of time, and we’re doing this all keeping the public health in mind.”

The what and why about wearing face covers in public

Facial expressions are about to take on a whole, new meaning while the coronavirus continues to affect the lives of everyone in the state. An updated executive order from Gov. Janet Mills includes the requirement of wearing cloth face coverings “in public places where physical distancing is difficult to maintain,” including grocery stores and takeout food lines.
While wearing face coverings has been an evolving topic since the pandemic made its way into the country and the state, the new requirement has brought questions about what people are now required to wear when out and about.
Here are some answers:
Question: Why has the directive to the public changed from not wearing a face cover to being required to wear a cloth face cover in public?
Answer: The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites “new data about how COVID-19 spreads” in its recommendation for people to wear cloth face coverings in public. The CDC states that “recent research indicates that a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 do not experience symptoms, and that those who go on to develop symptoms can transmit the virus to others before feeling sick. While a cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others.”
<img class="wp-image-16838626 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/16830022_SJ.CITfacecoverQnAP.050120-1-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" />
Q: What face covers are acceptable for use in public?
A: The latest executive order from Gov. Mills uses federal CDC guidance that defines a cloth face covering “covers the nose and mouth and fits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face; is secured with ties or ear loops; includes multiple layers of fabric; allows for breathing without restriction; and is able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to its shape.”
Q: How can the public get access to a cloth face cover?
A: The governor, in a news release announcing the updated executive order, “is encouraging Maine people to make their own cloth face coverings from common materials or to purchase them from a Maine-based company to support local businesses. The Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership has compiled a list of Maine companies producing face coverings, which the Administration is sharing with Maine people as a resource.”
The federal CDC suggests cloth face coverings can be made from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost.
Q: Who is exempt from wearing a face cover in public?
A: As part of Gov. Mills’ updated executive order, “cloth face coverings are not required for children under age 2, a child in a child care setting, or for anyone who has trouble breathing or related medical conditions, or who is otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.”
The executive order further states that “a person who cannot wear a cloth face covering because of a medical condition is not required to produce medical documentation of the condition, provided that an employer may require such documentation from an employee in accordance with state and federal law.”
Q: How often do I need to wash my face cover?
A: According to guidance from the federal CDC, cloth face covers “should be routinely washed depending on the frequency of use.” The CDC states that a washing machine should suffice in cleaning a cloth face cover.
Q: What are the rules for employers and employees, in terms of wearing face covers?
A: As part of a general guidance checklist produced by the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development, employers must ensure that employees have access to cloth face coverings. The governor’s executive order does make an exception: “Employers in settings that are not typically accessible to the public may determine the persons who should wear a cloth face covering at their workplace and shall permit any employee who wants to wear a covering to do so.”
As part of a checklist for cosmetology and barbering businesses, in regards to hair services, employees and practicing business owners are required to wear face masks at all times, “as long as there is not a face mask shortage for health care.” The checklist states that cloth coverings are not acceptable. The checklist also suggests to consider providing face covers to clients.
A separate checklist for dog hrooming states “Face covering is encouraged for both groomers and clients.”

COVID-19 threatens recreational season

NORWAY — Social distancing and stay-at-home orders have had an immediate and drastic effect on Maine’s economy. Seasonal recreation businesses around Oxford Hills are warily watching the calendar to see if Governor Janet Mills will ease restrictions or extend the state’s civil emergency beyond May 15.
Campgrounds, kids’ summer camps, marinas and others all promise to be affected. By the end of April recreational businesses are normally in final preparations for a busy summer season. But in the age of COVID-19 many still do not know if they will be able to open.
Western Maine’s lakes are dotted with sleep-away camps that welcome children for two to eight week stays starting in June. Many accommodate as many as 200 at a time and employ 100 or more seasonal workers. Statewide, the industry contributes more than $200 million to the economy.
Seeds of Peace, the acclaimed international camp located in Otisfield, already announced in early April that it would not open this year because of the coronavirus threat. Other camps are taking a wait-and-see approach.
“We are cautiously optimistic,” said Gregg Parker, co-owner/director of Camp Waziyatah on McWain Pond in Waterford. “It may be that we hold a truncated season this year or perhaps host smaller sessions. But it’s also possible we may not be able to open at all.”
Camp Waziyatah’s 2020 season is scheduled to start on June 28 with sessions running through August 20. Even a best-case scenario for operations will bring disruptions for the camp, counselors and campers, as a number of employees and attendees are from other countries. Parker said hiring for the season is set but even if conditions in Maine are safe for operations, international travel to get here may be difficult.
Most summer camps are preparing while in limbo, awaiting direction from the governor and Maine’s Center for Disease Control. According to Ron Hall, executive director of Maine Summer Camps, most of the association’s members can wait it out for several more weeks before deciding what, if anything, they will be able to do for business this year.
Campground owners are in a similar situation – they need to be ready to open as usual but have received no indication that they will be able to.
Greg Kyllonen, who owns Hebron Pines with his bother Dale and their wives, is already losing money because he has not been able to open their nine-hole golf course yet this year.
“Normally, golfers start coming to play as soon as the snow is gone,” Kyllonen said. “But we’ve had to keep the course closed this spring.”
Hebron Pines Campground is scheduled to open May 15. It hosts family events like weddings and reunions as well as car shows and even historical reenactments. Kyllonen said they are ready to go but everything hinges on the state easing restrictions and then customers feeling confident enough that the health crisis has passed to venture out for vacations.
White’s Marina in Norway is open under the same restrictions as other essential businesses. Their service department is open and boat owners with extra time on their hands have been pulling their boats from storage and getting out on the water earlier than normal. Owner Randa White said that while the showroom doors are locked prospective buyers have made appointments to try out boats. But she said it’s too early in the season to know what impact coronavirus may have on her business.
“We are still in our slow season,” White said. “It’s too early to know.”
The marina does boat sales, service and storage. It employs four full-time and three seasonal workers. In that regard it has stayed business as usual, although White says they have had to juggle schedules because of schools being closed.
She said people coming to the western lakes region to open their summer camps has been good for their business. It remains to be seen how her sales season will go.
One issue that could cause White’s Marina to take a financial hit? If kids’ summer camps are unable to open.
“We store and service probably 30 boats for summer camps,” White said. “If they don’t open, then that will end up hurting our business this year.”

Texto completo: PORTLAND — The Portland Symphony Orchestra will cancel all PSO concerts as well as select events through the end of June.
“While we are saddened by the need to cancel the remainder of the season we take solace in the joy and connections made through “PSO: Notes from Home,” the “PSO: Education Everywhere” series and the “Symphony Sundays” on Maine Public, all of which bring the orchestra into the living rooms of our community, and the upcoming Solo Together “Un-Gala” on May 14, featuring a night of PSO musicians, comments from Music Director Eckart Preu and more, to replace our annual Wine Dinner,” said Executive Director Carolyn Nishon.
Ticket holders are asked to consider donating the price of their ticket to the PSO as a tax-deductible donation. The support is not only appreciated but vital to sustaining the PSO’s work through these challenging times and beyond.

Forty acres protected on the Crooked River

OTISFIELD — On March 28, the Western Foothills Land Trust acquired an additional 42.8 acres of land in the Sebago Lake watershed. The forested Otisfield parcel includes 2,230 ft of frontage on the Crooked River. The Crooked River is the major tributary to Sebago Lake, providing 39% of the surface water flow into the lake. Sebago Lake is the reservoir for the Portland Water District, supplying clean drinking water to 1/6th of Maine, over 200,000 households and businesses. This piece of property is contiguous to three other WFLT properties, which together protect 306 acres of land and 11,424 ft of contiguous river frontage.
This newly acquired parcel increases the conserved lands along the Crooked River corridor, lands protected by fee ownership or conservation easement by the Western Foothills Land Trust, Loon Echo Land Trust, municipalities, the State of Maine, and the US Forest Service. Currently there are almost 10 miles of shore frontage protected along the 50-mile long Crooked River and 9,948 acres of lands protected within the Crooked River watershed. The Crooked River watershed is part of the larger Sebago Lake watershed.
This land was part of the traditional territory of the original land stewards, the Pequawket band of the Abenaki tribe.. Since settlement by colonialists, the land has been managed as a working forest. The most recent owners, Dale Scribner and his son Jesse Scribner, sold the land to Western Foothills in March. Due to the coronavirus crisis, the closing was accomplished by mail.
Approximately half the property is upland forests. These include pine-oak forest dominated by white pine, red oak, and hemlock, and pine barrens characterized by pitch pine. There is a small patch of northern hardwood forest that includes American beech, yellow birch, sugar maple, and some eastern hemlock. The lowland portion of the property is forested and shrub wetland, which plays a critical natural water filtering role for the Crooked River. As is common along the Crooked River, the parcel includes an old oxbow.
The Crooked River is valuable Wild Brook Trout Habitat and is the principal spawning tributary for the unique indigenous landlocked salmon of Sebago Lake, one of only four such populations in Maine. As the largest tributary to Sebago Lake, preserving forestland within this watershed is a critically important component to protecting water quality, community well-being, a vibrant economy, and fish and wildlife habitat in the Sebago Lake watershed, and for downstream water users in the greater Portland area.
Funding for this project came from the Maine Natural Resource Conservation Program, Casco Bay Estuary Partnership, Portland Water District, the Sebago Clean Waters Due Diligence Fund.

When can I go to a library again? Who, exactly, has to quarantine for 14 days and what does that mean?

Texto completo: This story and all coronavirus news are free to the public. Support us as we do our part to keep the community safe.
Part of an occasional series answering readers’ questions about Maine.
Q: I haven’t found where libraries fall into the state’s reopening plan. When can they reopen?
A: Libraries are one of the many business and service sectors not listed anywhere in the reopening plan, so you are not the only one who is perplexed.
<img class="alignleft wp-image-5221146" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/askME-vert-CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="265" /> Generally, those sectors not listed are not yet scheduled for reopening and either will have to wait until later this summer or are working with the state to set up a sector-specific reopening plan.
Librarians across Maine are talking with one another and state officials about how to reopen, but they’re not anticipating that will happen until phase 2 or 3 of the state’s reopening plan. That means reopening June, 1 at the earliest.
The Maine State Library and Maine Library Association are working with the Department of Economic and Community Development and the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to determine exactly how and when libraries can safely reopen, according to Jennifer Alvino, a library director in Windham and president of the library association.
A task force that includes representatives of the Maine State Library, Maine Library Association and other librarians is being formed to develop guidelines for libraries to safely welcome back patrons. That is a complicated task, Alvino says, because libraries are community gathering spaces where people touch paper materials that can’t be easily disinfected. That could mean that some libraries might begin offering curbside pickup, hold off on special events, limit the number of people in the library or make other modifications to keep library staff and patrons safe.
Q: Does the reopening order mean older citizens or those at risk are no longer mandated to stay home?
A: No. In fact, the stay-at-home order has been extended through May 30.
The new order to start the reopening process does allow some additional Mainers to leave home and go to work, while others can now leave home for a wider array of services beyond just the essentials, such as grocery stores, hardware stores and hospitals.
Among other things, you can now also leave home to get a haircut or a car wash or play golf.
But all Mainers, and especially older people or those with underlying medical conditions, are still under a general stay-at-home order to prevent the coronavirus from spreading.
While active cases have declined, Maine is still seeing outbreaks of the virus and Mainers are still at risk, Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said Thursday. It is still wise for everyone to stay home as much as possible, and older folks should remain especially careful to limit their exposure to people outside their households, he warned.
The idea behind the reopening plan is to gradually leave our homes so Maine’s infections continue to decline, and not rise again.
Q: Can folks from away go to a grocery story or an open park during their 14-day quarantine period?
A: The order requiring people arriving in Maine to self-quarantine for 14 days says they must stay indoors “except when engaging in essential services.”
Essential services includes grocery shopping, but does not include taking a walk or visiting a park. The order also refers to guidance posted by the Maine CDC, which is even more restrictive:
“To self-quarantine follow these precautions: Stay at home for 14 days. Monitor for fever (take temperature two times per day), cough, or trouble breathing. Practice social distancing. Stay home (do not go to work or school), do not take public transportation or ride-shares. … You cannot go to public places including grocery stores or other essential personal reasons, except to seek emergency medical care. Plan to bring food for 14 days with you or arrange to have it delivered.”
Q: I live in Maine but must cross the state border for work. Do I have to quarantine?
A: There is no order to quarantine for people who make short trips back and forth across the border for work, according to the Maine CDC.
Travel should be limited to essential trips, such as commuting to permitted workplaces or grocery shopping.
This is not the same as someone visiting Maine or returning from a long-term winter stay in another state, the Maine CDC says. Those people are permitted to come, but are required to quarantine upon arrival for 14 days, or for as long as they are here if they don’t stay that long.
The state continues to discourage visitors from coming to Maine from areas with widespread virus outbreaks.

Theater at Monmouth postpones (R)evolutionary Season

Texto completo: MONMOUTH – For the first time in the theater’s history, Theater at Monmouth will not produce a Summer Repertory Season. TAM’s 2020 (R)evolutionary Season was scheduled to begin public performances on June 27 and conclude Aug. 27. TAM currently plans to produce the plays of the (R)evolutionary Season in 2021.
The season was programmed to celebrate Maine’s Bicentennial, the 100th Anniversary of Women’s Suffrage, and the Election Year. Summer Repertory plays included Shakespeare’s Cymbeline directed by Eddie DeHais and Julius Caesar directed by Bill van Horn; the Maine premiere of Mat Smart’s The Agitators directed by Josiah Davis; a World Premier of Callie Kimball’s Sofonisba directed by Dawn McAndrews; Edward Albee’s Seascape directed by Kate Bergstrom. The Family Show, Aesop’s Guide to Friendship adapted by Dawn McAndrews and directed by Ian Kramer, annually reaches young people and the young at heart.
Before the Governor’s announcement of the four-stage plan to reopen the State, it was already clear that it would be extraordinarily difficult to go ahead with TAM’s summer season in a way that protected the health and well-being of audience and company members. Any lingering hopes that somehow, someway, the season might happen were dashed with the announcement of plans for reopening the State. Unfortunately, under that plan, theaters will be among the last classes of establishments to re-open. Theaters across the country have shuttered, and many artists find themselves suddenly unemployed. It is essential that Maine’s only Classical Repertory Theater does not collapse. By making the difficult choice to postpone productions this summer, TAM hopes to ensure that it will survive until next year and thrive in the summers to come.
“We surveyed our patrons early on and had an idea of what they would and wouldn’t do in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus and what guidance they would be looking for from state and national officials before making a decision to come to the theater again.” said Dawn McAndrews, TAM’s Producing Artistic director. “On April 28, we expected that the Governor would announce an extension of the Stay Healthy at Home mandate and were hoping for guidance on how best to move forward during the pandemic. Governor Mill’s announcement confirmed that arts organizations and particularly theaters would not be opening for some time. We recognize that many patrons will be disappointed by the news but due to the continued threat of COVID-19, we’ve decided to postpone the 2020 season.”
Theater at Monmouth previously cancelled its spring Page to Stage Education Tour PACHANGA! Latinx Stories for Kids in consultation with school administrators. This annual tour brings adaptations of classic literature to elementary and middle school students throughout Maine and into New Hampshire. McAndrews continued, “We looked for ways to bring this production to students through video or live streaming but with actors and director coming from New York City, it would have been impossible to guarantee the safety of artists and our community.”

Theater at Monmouth, founded in 1970, was named the Shakespearean Theater of Maine in 1975. The theatre’s mission is to present innovative approaches to Shakespeare and other classic plays through professional productions that enrich the lives of people throughout Maine. Since its founding,

WOODSTOCK — Going on a hike, or a run, and spending time with her work family at Cafe Nomad are a few ways Telstar senior Abbey Landry has been able to stay positive during these times of uncertainty.
Landry was staring down the final months of school when COVID-19 hit fast and hard.
The first major change was the shift to remote learning. Landry was taking all her classes at Central Maine Community College when she learned of the change in early March. The transition to online classes has been challenging for her and many of her friends.
“I’m really not having a great time with it. I’m finding it very hard to focus and complete work in one sitting like I was able to before,” she said. “Online learning really isn’t for me. I know a lot of my friends are in the same boat.”
Though Landry knew she would not be returning to campus at CMCC, she was holding onto hope that senior events back at Telstar would still happen, just at a later date.
As the virus rapidly spread, and things worsened day to day, reality began to further sink. Her senior year was going to be a lot different than she had envisioned.
“To not be able to have the graduation we’ve been planning for so long isn’t an easy thing to process,” Landry said. “This is what we’ve been looking forward to since kindergarten when everyone either wanted to grow up to be a princess or the president.”
Another major loss was spring sports, which were cancelled at the end of March. Landry is a fall and winter athlete only, but feels for those who are missing out on their final seasons of sports.
“I am not a spring sport athlete but I know kids that are and their spring sports are like my skiing, I really feel for them, I can’t imagine losing the ski or soccer season of my senior year,” she said.
Landry is an avid skier, who has been on the slopes since the age four.
Now, at 17, Landry is exploring all the different types of skiing the sport offers. She enjoys skiing on groomed trails, but has ventured off and skied the trees and bumps also. Landry said “being well rounded” in skiing is one of the best things people can do for themselves in the sport.
This year she placed first in Slalom at the Class B State Championship, finished first again in Giant Slalom in the Mountain Valley Conference.
She acknowledge that high school skiing in Maine is not the same as other states and that Telstar was not as competitive as other schools across the state. Regardless the time she has spent skiing at the school has been invaluable.
“Skiing can be a lot about who has the best what, but this group of kids are down to earth and know how to make it work for them. Skiing for Telstar has really taught me how to appreciate the sport and truly be apart of the team and be a leader,” she said.
Landry has had many coaches who’ve inspired her over her skiing career, but she singled two out. Kevin Hawthorne, her high school coach, and “Hutch,” her coach at the Mt. Abram competition program. Both made an impact, but in different ways.
“He was and is one of my biggest supporters and encouraged me to be a leader when I wasn’t really sure I could be one,” Landry said of Hawthorne.
“Hutch” was an incredible coach to work with and he taught me a lot about the sport. He really made me passionate about it in a way I never had before.”
Teachers in the classroom have also made their mark on the Woodstock resident, particularly in difficult times, when she was struggling with confidence and doing the “bare minimum for school work.”
She was also having difficulties balancing the academic workload with soccer and ski season, and her grades slid significantly during the first few sports season.
She needed encouragement and it came her way.
Numerous Telstar educators gave her room to grow as a student and person, reminding her that she is smart and capable and just needed to apply herself. The words were taken to heart.
She knew something in her daily routine needed to change. She sat down and planned out her day, scheduling specific times to do work while still making room for practices and competitions. Her habits and mindset began to improve.
Landry now prides herself on her “drive and discipline” and her accomplishments certainly speak to that.
On top of her first place finishes in skiing, she was also named an Academic All Star, maintaining a GPA of 90 or above.
This fall, Landry will attend the University of Maine at Farmington as a dual athlete in soccer and skiing. She is going to school to be a science teacher, which has already given her a greater appreciation of what teachers are going through right now.
“Going into education myself, I can’t imagine what it’s like being a teacher right now,” she said. “If you’re an educator of any grade or subject and you’re reading this, thank you. Your hard work is appreciated more than you’d ever know.”

Texto completo: PORTLAND – The Maine Film Association is launching a collaborative community film project, “Antidote – Maine Stories from the 2020 Pandemic.” The MFA is calling for short film submissions to include in the collection. “Antidote” will be a compilation of a variety of works created by Maine-based filmmakers that document the Maine experience during the COVID-19 crisis. “Antidote” will be shared with audiences via MFA news, virtual screenings, and social media. Other options for television broadcast and possible theatrical screenings in a post-pandemic world are being explored.

Texto completo: NORWAY — Norway Town Manager Dennis Lajoie is pleased to announce the Town has been awarded a Safety Enhancement Grant by the Maine Municipal Association Workers Compensation Fund in the amount of $2,000. The award was a joint application effort of the Highway, Parks & Recreation, Fire, Wastewater and Water Departments to purchase 100 traffic safety cones. These cones are required safety equipment used to redirect, slow down or stop traffic at road work sites, emergency sites and recreational events that use our roads. They enhance the safety of our employees and the public. These cones also meet MUTCD night time requirements, so are allowed to be used when Highway is using the striping machine to mark roads during the night or there is an emergency during these hours.
The Ed MacDonald Safety Enhancement Grants and Scholarship Grants provide financial assistance to members of the MMA Workers Compensation Fund to purchase safety equipment or services to assist in reducing the frequency and severity of workplace injuries.
The Grant programs are designed to prevent injuries and improve workplace safety for our Maine employees. The reduction in employee injuries also benefits the taxpayers by lessening lost hours at work, cost of claims and potential overtime expenses for employees who might have to fill in for injured co-workers.
The Maine Municipal Association has been awarding Safety Grants to members of the Workers’ Compensation fund since 1999. The Ed MacDonald Safety Enhancement Grants and Scholarships are an example of a successful partnership that has been preventing workplace injuries by bestowing more than $5 million in the funding of 3,938 Safety Enhancement Grants and 489 Scholarship Grants. Together we are building safe communities.
For more information about Maine Municipal Association Risk Management Service programs, including Safety Enhancement Grant eligibility and applications, please visit www.memun.org and click on the Risk Management Services link, or call 1-800-590-5583.

Texto completo: April 30, 1911: The Great Fire of 1911 begins in a hay shed on Broad Street in downtown Bangor.
<img class="alignleft wp-image-13690530 size-full" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/Me200-Verticle-SMALL-e1577809540930.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="161" />
Over two days, the fire ravages the city’s core on both sides of Kenduskeag Stream, destroying 285 homes, 100 businesses, the public high school, two fire stations, six churches and a synagogue. The city library burns after barely having escaped destruction in two previous fires, the most recent in 1910.
It is Maine’s worst downtown fire of the 20th century.
Old Town and Brewer firefighters arrive as fast as possible to help fight the flames, but it is not enough. Because the telephone exchange is one of the first buildings to burn, Mayor Charles W. Mullen races in his car to a train junction to send word to other cities around the state that Bangor needs help. He later places the city under martial law.
<img class="size-full wp-image-16313358" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/0430-bangor.jpg" alt="" width="873" height="631" />
One man escapes being injured by a falling building only to be killed when another collapses. A falling chimney kills a Brewer firefighter on Penobscot Street.
“The downtown area resembled a bombed city after the conflagration, with steam and smoke rising from the ruins,” author Trudy Irene Scee writes in her 2010 history of the city. Hundreds of people are left homeless.

Mass. GDP shrunk by more than 6% in the first quarter, report says

Texto completo: ECONOMY
Mass. GDP shrunk by more than 6% in the first quarter, report says The Massachusetts economy shrunk at a 6.1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter of the year but the damage from the pandemic is likely far worse, according to a new estimate offered by local economists who edit the MassBenchmarks report. It compares to an estimated 4.8 percent decline in gross domestic product nationwide over the same time period. Both the state and national economies grew by an annualized rate of just over 2 percent in the final three months of 2019. The MassBenchmarks economists said those national and state estimates for the first quarter don't fully reflect the severity of the pandemic-induced downturn, in part because the recession didn't begin until the middle of March. Alan Clayton-Matthews, a Northeastern University professor and MassBenchmarks senior editor, noted that 650,000 people filed unemployment claims in Massachusetts between March 15 and April 18. That number implies roughly 20 percent of the labor force was unemployed or on furlough as of mid-April. With that in mind, Clayton-Matthews expects the decline in gross state product to be at least 25 percent in the second quarter, which would be the worst on record. — JON CHESTO
PANDEMIC
Maine company making virus testing swabs teams up to double production A Maine company that makes specialized swabs for coronavirus testing is teaming up with construction company Cianbro and Navy shipbuilder Bath Iron Works to double production, officials said Thursday. The Trump administration is providing $75.5 million to Guilford-based Puritan Medical Products through the Defense Production Act to boost production of the swabs, which are needed to ramp up testing. Cianbro is providing a building in Pittsfield and help setting up the production line, and Bath Iron Works is making 30 machines Puritan needs to increase production, company officials said Thursday. Thanks to the partnership, Puritan's production will double to 40 million of the swabs per month, said Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, who praised the “can do spirit" exhibited by the collaboration. The effort will create as many as 150 jobs in Pittsfield on top of the 300 to 500 workers already employed by Puritan in Guilford, officials said. The swabs that are produced by Puritan for coronavirus testing are longer than most swabs and have a synthetic material on the end. They're used for nasal swabs for tests for the coronoavirus. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
BROADBAND
Comcast's income drops as cord-cutting continues Comcast's net income slid in the first three months of the year as the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut down its theme parks and its movies were kept out of shuttered theaters. Comcast also reported Thursday that it lost 409,000 cable TV customers, the biggest source of the company's profits, as cord-cutting accelerated. That's already more than half the 671,000 customers it lost in all of 2019. But it added 477,000 internet customers, which it said was its best quarterly number in more than a decade. It came as US workplace shutdowns began in March and a mass work-from-home migration underscored the role home internet plays in Americans' lives. Americans are increasingly opting for cheaper streaming video providers that are delivered over the internet, like Netflix, which both benefits and harms Comcast's business as an internet and traditional TV provider. Competition in online video is also increasing with new entrants like Disney and Apple. Comcast's own streaming service, Peacock, will launch nationwide in July, with free and paid versions. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
Rates fall to record lows Long-term mortgage rates tumbled to all-time lows this week as the economy and housing market continued to reel from the business and social shutdown spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. The average rate on the benchmark 30-year home loan fell to 3.23 percent, the lowest level since mortgage buyer Freddie Mac started tracking rates in 1971. That was down from 3.33 percent last week and 4.14 percent a year ago. The average rate on the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 2.77 percent from 2.86 percent last week, Freddie Mac reported Thursday. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
AVIATION
American Airlines loses $2.24b in the first quarter American Airlines reported a staggering loss of $2.24 billion for the first quarter, when the coronavirus pandemic triggered a sharp drop in air travel. The airline's revenue fell 19 percent while costs continued to rise even as the virus spread. The situation facing the airline industry has grown more dire since the first quarter ended. Air travel within the US has plunged 95 percent from a year ago, judging by the number of people screened at the nation's airports. American's massive loss compared with a profit of $185 million in the same quarter last year. American said that adjusted for non-recurring items, it lost $2.65 per share. That was worse than the average forecast of a $2.08 per share loss from 15 analysts surveyed by FactSet. American estimated that it ended March with $6.8 billion in cash and other liquidity, including $2 billion that it raised during the first quarter, and will have $11 billion at the end of June. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline has cut its flying schedule by 80 percent in April and May and 70 percent in June. It has grounded hundreds of planes. Nearly 39,000 employees have accepted early retirement, partially paid leave or fewer hours of work. Cheaper fuel caused by the collapse in energy prices will contribute to a reduction of more than $12 billion in its 2020 spending, the airline said. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
SOCIAL MEDIA
Twitter struggles with advertising slump caused by pandemic Twitter's stock tumbled Thursday after the company failed to show that it's weathering the pandemic-borne digital advertising slump the same way its bigger rivals Facebook and Google are. The San Francisco-based social company's higher expenses outweighed its revenue growth in the first three months of the year, leading to a loss of $8.4 million. And when asked during a conference call how April looked in terms of revenue, executives pointed back to the second half of March — when advertising declined. Facebook, in contrast, said on Wednesday that after a March decline, it saw “signs of stability" in the first three weeks of April. And it said ad revenue during that period has been flat compared with the year-ago period. Google parent company Alphabet also posted results this week that didn't look “quite as bad as some people had feared," said Edward Jones analyst David Heger. All three companies are seeing an increase in usage, since the virus outbreak has forced people to stay at home. Twitter reported that average daily users grew 24 percent year over year, the highest growth rate in the company's history. Twitter has added 14 million daily users since the previous quarter. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

The seasonal opening of the observatory at the top of the Penobscot Narrows Bridge will be delayed until further notice.
The observatory typically is closed each year from November through April.
That is the latest closure to come as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Maine Department of Transportation announced the closure in a Thursday morning tweet.
A statement on the department's website said the observatory could reopen on June 1 "at the earliest."
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
For those who still want to experience the scenic views, the Maine secretary of state's office has a virtual tour of the observatory that allows viewers to take the elevator to the top and look out over a virtual Penobscot River. The virtual tour can be accessed at https://www.thinglink.com/mediacard/1238865147544469505.
The 2,120-foot-long cable-stayed bridge carries U.S. Route 1 over the Penobscot River, connecting Verona Island to Prospect. It replaced the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, built in 1931.
The observatory, which opened in May 2007, is the tallest public bridge observatory in the world, according to the Transportation Department. It is one of four bridge observatories in the world, with the other three located in China, Thailand and Slovakia.

The Honors Luncheon that is typically held to honor Principal's Award winners has been postponed.
Rider will receive an MPA pin, an individual plaque and will be eligible to receive one of several $1,000 scholarships presented in the names of former Maine principals and MPA executive directors: Horace O. McGowan, Richard W. Tyler and Richard A. Durost. Three additional $1,000 scholarships will be presented through the partnership with Berlin City Auto Group's Drive for Education. These scholarships will be awarded randomly at a later date.
The Principal's Award is presented in more than 100 Maine public and private high schools by member principals of the MPA, the professional association which represents Maine's school administrators.

Texto completo: Up Beat is a new section of the Bangor Daily News dedicated to uplifting stories. Look for tales of people helping people and things that will make you smile.
Two years ago Journey Ramsey was delivering clothes and food to members of Maine's homeless community when she noticed a man with his dog standing near the Portland Preble Street outreach center on a very cold winter day.
As she watched, Ramsey said a woman whom she knew to be homeless and living in her car with her own dog, approached the man and offered him one of her extra dog coats because she had noticed his dog was shivering in the cold temperatures.
"This woman was one of the first people I had helped," Ramsey said. "She was homeless and living in her car because she had two dogs and would not abandon them to go live in a shelter and here she was giving what little she had to another pet in need."
That simple act of kindness is what gave Ramsey the idea to start Backpacks for Homeless Dogs, a program that fills backpacks with pet food, treats, coats, leashes, collars and other items to distribute to homeless individuals or others in need who have pets. So far, Ramsey estimates close to 200 packs have been given out.
Ramsey is on the board of directors for the Maine Homeless Veterans Alliance, which provides assistance and other services to homeless veterans in Maine, and that group has made the Backpacks for Homeless Dogs part of their ongoing community outreach efforts. Despite the name though, the project is aimed at all pets, not just dogs.
According to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, as of January 2019, there were an estimated 2,106 people experiencing homelessness on any given day in Maine. Of those, 116 were listed as veterans. There is no data on how many have pets.
[image id="2970310" size="full" pos="center" /]
Since starting the backpack program two years ago, Ramsey has helped scores of homeless veterans and others in need who would rather sacrifice their own health and comfort than see their pets suffer.
And it's not just for dogs. There is the cat who lives with his homeless person whom Ramsey would frequently see, and an elderly woman who was at the end of the month with little money.
"I was once contacted about a woman who could not afford both food for herself and cat litter for her cat," Ramsey said. "This is a woman in her 70s having to make that kind of decision [and] no one should have to be thinking like that."
Ramsey brought in Kevin Nicholson, chairman and founding member of the Maine Homeless Veterans Alliance, who was already making regular forays out into the community to bring items like personal hygiene products or sleeping bags to the homeless when Backpacks for Homeless Dogs began. To help out, Nicholson started carrying the stocked backpacks and giving them out as well to give out to members of the homeless community.
"Most of these homeless folks had [their pets] before they were homeless or whatever circumstance made them homeless," Nicholson said. "A lot of them are not willing to give up their best friends and it's tragic when that does happen. If they can get enough food and supplies to keep their pets, they should be able to."
Ramsey also helps formerly homeless individuals with pets transition into apartments or other housing by supplying pet food and other items for several months as they get their bearings and learn how to budget their resources.
Pets, Ramsey said, are crucial to the emotional and physical wellbeing of members of the homeless community and others in need. Animals don't judge and often provide the only physical contact the individual experiences on a day to day basis, she said.
"These pets are their best friends, their protectors and often the only 'person' they can talk to," Ramsey said. "Having a pet is very important."
But when the pandemic hit, it changed how Ramsey and her organization worked with the homeless and their pets. Maintaining the mandated social distancing of six feet between people and quarantine issues in her own home have meant changing how they do things.
In the early days of the pandemic, Ramsey said she and Nichols continued to keep stocked backpacks in their vehicles and came across a homeless person with a pet, they could give them the pack. But after the stay-at-home order was issued, they had to back off from that and turn it into more of a rapid response process in which word of the person in need comes to them, rather than the other way around.
"If I were to get a call about a homeless veteran or other person with a pet in need, one of us would make certain to get them some pet stuff," Ramsey said. "We did just get a call and Kevin brought an elderly vet some pet food."
Nicholson is always ready to respond to a homeless person in need and has continued going out to dispense needed items to that population during the pandemic.
"I'm being safe and maintaining social distancing," Nicholson said. "And it's not just homeless vets, our help is for everyone who is homeless and we are targeting everyone we can."
Ramsey said the project has always enjoyed some level of support from the community, but ever since Backpacks for Homeless Dogs appeared on several news broadcasts over the last two weeks, that support has exceeded Ramsey's expectations with donations of pet food, supplies, gift cards and cash coming in daily. In fact, her living room is so crammed full of items she can't remember the last time she was able to use it for anything other than a staging area.
[image id="2970308" size="full" pos="center" /]
Moving forward, Ramsey plans to identify a distribution site for the pet supplies. She is currently working to find a site and developing the guidelines for people to access it. That information, in addition to the times and dates the site will be open, will be posted on the groups Facebook page once they are finalized.
But in the meantime, she encourages anyone in need, or who knows of a pet owner in need to contact her and she will make sure the items get to that person.
"What Journey is doing is absolutely needed," Nicholson said. "She's not only helping the homeless people with dogs, but there are a lot of people in need that go directly to her for food [and] it is quite the thing she started."
To donate to Backpacks for Homeless Dogs, you can go to the Maine Homeless Veterans Alliance website at www.mainehva.org or to the programs social media page on Facebook. Ramsey said people can also email backpacksforhomelessdogs@hotmail.com .

Make mom smile this Mother's Day, with an improvised song from these Maine comedians

Texto completo: Jen Shepard and Larrance Fingerhut, the founders and owners of Bar Harbor-based comedy theater ImprovAcadia, have seen their main means of income disappear as theaters and clubs statewide have shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Their 17th season of offering improv comedy shows at their intimate Cottage Street theater was supposed to start later this month. With continuing restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people not likely to be lifted for at least another month, the chances of even having shows at all this year seems increasingly unlikely.
But Shepard and Fingerhut have come up with a novel way to keep an income stream going while staying safe -- and also making people's days a little brighter. For $20, Shepard and Fingerhut will improvise and record a song especially for that most special of people: your mom, ahead of Mother's Day on Sunday, May 10.
"Since we have no foreseeable income anytime soon, it's a way to generate something to keep us afloat," said Shepard. "And everyone wants to do something nice for their mom."
Those who wish to purchase a song must fill out a brief questionnaire about their mom, with questions about jobs, hobbies, vacations, nicknames, favorite meals and other mom-centric details. From there, Fingerhut will take to the piano, while Shepard comes up with hilarious lyrics based on an individual's answers to their questions. The performance is filmed and then emailed off to the recipient. They are capping the number of song requests at 100, so they are able to fulfill them all in time for Mother's Day.
[image id="2970175" size="full" pos="center" /]
Improvising songs is a regular part of a typical ImprovAcadia show. Fingerhut, a pianist and musical director for both ImprovAcadia and for shows at Penobscot Theatre Co. in Bangor, actually did a similar thing for Mother's Day, when he was with a different improv troupe in Chicago back in the 1990s.
"I composed a little frame for the song, and then the improvisers took off from there," said Fingerhut. "Back then, we did it to raise money so we could go to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. And that was before the Internet was commonplace, so we either did it live, or we'd call up the mother and leave it on their answering machine."
The model for Fingerhut and Shepard's songs this time around will be a bit different from the original, including what Shepard describes as a "William Shatner-esque" dramatic spoken word interlude.
During a normal season, ImprovAcadia welcomes improv performers from all over the country, including from both Fingerhut and Shepard's comedy alma maters, The Second City and Improv Olympics, both in Chicago. This year, they're not sure if any of them will be able to come to live in Bar Harbor for the summer.
"Comedy is such an intimate thing. Part of the way it works is that people are elbow to elbow, and the laughter just sets the room off," said Fingerhut. "It's really hard to replicate that sort of thing via Zoom. It's hard to make it infectious. Infectious, in the good way, that is."
The couple are hopeful that as restrictions begin to lift as the summer progresses, some of their improvisers that live in Maine year-round will be able to join them for some limited performances. They also want to continue offering improvised songs for all sorts of occasions, well beyond Mother's Day.
"People want graduation songs, birthday songs, anniversary songs," said Shepard. "We have a really fun idea for Father's Day, too. The response so far to all of this has been overwhelming. It's a great way to do something nice for someone, while also supporting local artists."

A staffing firm that employs some of the doctors in three rural Maine hospitals -- including two that are now in bankruptcy and suing the federal government for stimulus funding -- is reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy itself as a result of steep revenue shortfalls related to the coronavirus.
Just as those hospitals have lost considerable revenue after preparing to handle the pandemic, Envision Healthcare Corp. is struggling to pay off $7 billion in debt after the crisis forced medical systems all across the U.S. to delay lucrative elective services, according to Bloomberg.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
As a result, Envision -- which provides staffing to hospitals across the country -- has hired restructuring advisors and considered seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to help manage its debts, Bloomberg reported. It based the report on information from unnamed sources who said the situation was fluid and subject to change.
Envision, one of the largest physician staffing firms in the country, employs the ER doctors of Calais Regional Hospital, Penobscot Valley Hospital in Lincoln and Down East Community Hospital in Machias. It also employs the doctors, known as hospitalists, who see admitted patients at Penobscot Valley Hospital.
An Envision spokesperson, Aliese Polk, did not directly respond to a request for confirmation of the Bloomberg report or an explanation of how a bankruptcy proceeding would affect its services at the three Maine hospitals.
"As clinicians who live and work in the Washington and Penobscot communities, we are focused on caring for our neighbors and supporting our hospital partners," Polk said in an emailed response. "Envision Physician Services is treating COVID-19 patients and working to mitigate the spread of the virus while continuing to provide care to all patients seeking emergency care in the communities it serves."
In general, companies usually continue operating during Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it gives them protections while they try to reorganize their debts and return to profitability, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Some companies continue to operate after the process, while others end up being liquidated.
All three Maine hospitals that use Envision doctors run on thin or negative operating margins. In the last year-and-a-half, Calais Regional Hospital and Penobscot Valley Hospital have both sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to help restructure their millions in debts. The Calais and Machias hospitals began using Envision to staff their emergency rooms in recent months.
As part of their bankruptcy cases, the Calais and Lincoln hospitals have both just filed lawsuits against the federal government because they were denied access to a relief program meant to help small businesses keep their staff employed during the coronavirus, but that has interim rules barring applicants who are in bankruptcy. The hospitals have said that restriction is unlawful and that they could have to close their doors by the end of June if they don't receive more stimulus funds.
A Calais Regional Hospital spokesperson referred any questions to Envision, and Penobscot Valley Hospital CEO Crystal Landry said that she had not heard reports that the company may file for bankruptcy.
Julie Hixson, a spokesperson for Down East Community Hospital, said: "We don't have any real information on this and feel it would be imprudent to prematurely speculate on their possible bankruptcy protection filing. Regardless, it will play no part in our ability to stay safely staffed or our ability to care for the people who come to our emergency department.
"The people in this community have enough to deal with right now," Hixson added. "We want them to know that DECH and all our provider practices are here to take care of them. We also want them to know that Envision is committed to taking care of patients at DECH; they have assured us of that."

Another Mainer has died as health officials confirmed 39 new coronavirus cases in the state on Thursday.
There have now been 1,095 confirmed coronavirus cases across all of Maine's counties, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That's up from 1,056 on Wednesday.
The latest death involved a woman in her 50s from Cumberland County, bringing the statewide death toll to 53.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Nearly half of Thursday's new confirmed cases -- 19 -- involved Penobscot County residents. That comes a day after revelations about an outbreak at the Hope House Health and Living Center in Bangor that infected 21 residents and staff at the homeless shelter. Two of those cases were detected late last week and a third earlier this week. By Wednesday afternoon, another 18 were confirmed positive, a spokesperson for the shelter, Dan Cashman, told the BDN. Of the 21 cases, 17 were guests and four were staff members, Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said Thursday.
Of the outbreaks at congregate care facilities in the state, 76 cases are at the Augusta Center for Health and Rehabilitation; Edgewood Rehabilitation & Living Center is reporting 14 cases; Falmouth by the Sea is reporting 36 cases; the Maine Veterans' Home in Scarborough is reporting 51 cases; the Tall Pines facility is reporting 43 cases; and The Cedars in Portland is reporting 15 cases.
Additionally, the Tyson Foods plant in Portland is reporting 10 cases -- an increase of two cases since Wednesday.
Of the statewide total, 255 cases are health care workers, according to Shah.
So far, 170 Mainers have been hospitalized at some point with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Of those, 35 people are currently hospitalized, with 18 in critical care and eight on ventilators, according to the Maine CDC.
Meanwhile, another 631 people have fully recovered from the coronavirus, meaning there are 411 active cases in the state. That's up from 389 on Wednesday.
A majority of the cases have been in Mainers over age 50, while more cases have been reported in women than men, according to the Maine CDC.
Another 19,546 people have tested negative for the coronavirus, according to the Maine CDC.
Thursday's report comes as the state prepares to gradual relax coronavirus-related restrictions put in place to halt the disease's spread. Under a new order from Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, certain businesses, including barber shops, salons and other personal services, will be permitted to reopen Friday, while keeping in place a ban on gathering of 10 or more people and restrictions on lodgings and other industries into the summer. That will start to ease the economic crunch that has left 108,500 Mainers jobless since March 15 and prompted protests calling on the governor to allow businesses to reopen.
So far, the coronavirus has hit hardest in Cumberland County, where 486 cases have been confirmed and where the bulk of deaths from the virus -- 26 -- have been concentrated. It is one of four counties -- the others are Androscoggin, Penobscot and York, with 48, 78 and 205 cases, respectively -- where "community transmission" has been confirmed, according to the Maine CDC.
There are two criteria for establishing community transmission: at least 10 confirmed cases and that at least 25 percent of those are not connected to either known cases or travel. That second condition has not yet been "satisfied" in other counties.
Other cases have been detected in Aroostook (5), Franklin (27), Hancock (10), Kennebec (104), Knox (16), Lincoln (13), Oxford (15), Piscataquis (1), Sagadahoc (19), Somerset (17), Waldo (48) and Washington (2) counties. Information about where another case was detected was not immediately available Thursday.
As of Thursday afternoon, the coronavirus has sickened 1,054,261 people in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as caused 61,717 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.

PORTLAND, Maine -- Since the state announced it would allow salons and barber shops to reopen, Colleen Calder's phone has been blowing up with appointment requests from regulars.
"I'll be there on Friday," many tell her. Like many barbers, stylists and cosmetologists, the owner of Aphrodite Salon in Portland's Monument Square could use the work. She has not gotten unemployment benefits or a federal stimulus check.
But Calder won't open until she is comfortable that she can implement new state health guidelines, which may not be for a few weeks. When salons reopen, they'll be working at limited capacity to adhere to guidelines, she said. Stores she buys supplies from are closed.
"It's going to be a different world for sure," she said.

Barber shops and salons are among a first wave of Maine businesses cleared to open on May 1 as part of a timeline announced on Tuesday by Gov. Janet Mills to reopen the state's economy after more than a month of business shutdowns prompted by the coronavirus.
That announcement has sent a shockwave through the industry, as barbers and salon workers balance safety risks against their own revenue drought. On Wednesday, some shops in urban areas with higher confirmed case counts grappled with the decision to reopen. Many barbers in rural areas were raring to go.
Though many of her friends are eager to get back behind the chair, Jessica Levecque, a self-employed stylist who rents a chair at KLM Studio on Congress Street, said she needs more time to process. She is targeting a May return, saying "we're kind of the guinea pigs."
"The demand for hair is insane right now," she said. "You've got this pressure of going back to work and potentially exposing yourself [to the virus] and then coming home to your families, but if you don't you might lose a big share of your business."
Businesses that open Friday must adhere to a checklist of safety measures that have yet to be issued. Heather Johnson, the commissioner of the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development, said they are expected to include distancing protocols such as having clients wait in cars instead of waiting rooms and sanitation provisions.
"A business that's not able to satisfy each and every one of the criteria on the checklist should think twice before they make the decision to reopen," said Nirav Shah, the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, at a Wednesday news conference.
Jason Dodge, who owns Momentum Salon on Exchange Street in Portland, has been watching state news conferences for weeks, hoping for this kind of "good news." He's been hustling to open by Friday, fielding a steady stream of appointment requests.
"We want to make people comfortable, safe, and make them feel human again by getting a haircut," Dodge said.
The environment is much different in Machias. While Cumberland County has seen 45 percent of Maine's 1,056 confirmed cases and 25 of 53 deaths from the virus as of Wednesday, Washington County has only seen two cases and no fatalities.

Wayne Wood took the virus seriously when it arrived, closing his Machias barber shop a week before a state-issued mandate. But he hasn't been happy with the way it's been handled since.
"If we had a whole lot of sickness and people were dying in Washington County, they wouldn't shut the rest of the state down," said Wood, who has owned Wayne's Barber Shop on Main Street for 25 years.
He said his shop is "pretty sanitized as it is," but when he reopens, he'll make everyone wear masks, wipe down surfaces more frequently and implement a new plan to serve clients without the use of a waiting area. He said his wife "will take names and it's going to be roughly an hour wait" with people waiting outside.
A local fixture, Wood said he's had people begging him to make house visits to cut their hair over the last six weeks. He's worried about how the economy is going to hold up over the summer, but he's ready to get back to work.
"I'm excited," Wood said. "The only nerve-wracking thing is that I got about 1,200 people who need their haircut at once."

PORTLAND, Maine -- An anonymous, spray-painted mural appeared on a retaining wall beneath the sewage treatment plant on the East End this week. The yards-long image is a thank you card to essential workers still on the job amid the global coronavirus pandemic.
Dedicated to the "helpers and the heroes," it simply reads "thank you" in 6-foot-high letters on a purple background. On the sides of the written words are cartoon depictions of some of those heroes and helpers.

A bus driver, a nurse, a doctor and sanitation worker can be seen along with an ambulance, grocery store clerk and mother -- or possibly a teacher -- with two children.

The 100-foot wall is a city-sanctioned surface for spray-can graffiti artists. In 2016 it bore a controversial depiction of then Gov. Paul LePage in Ku Klux Klan regalia. The city refused to remove it citing the First Amendment, but it sparked a controversy over the wall that spilled into 2017. Ultimately the city and the Portland Water District, which operates the sewage treatment plant, decided to keep the wall open to artists.

Another Mainer has died as health officials confirmed 39 new coronavirus cases in the state on Thursday.
There have now been 1,095 confirmed coronavirus cases across all of Maine's counties, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That's up from 1,056 on Wednesday.
The latest death involved a woman in her 50s from Cumberland County, bringing the statewide death toll to 53.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Nearly half of Thursday's new confirmed cases -- 19 -- involved Penobscot County residents. That comes a day after revelations about an outbreak at the Hope House Health and Living Center in Bangor that infected 21 residents and staff at the homeless shelter. Two of those cases were detected late last week and a third earlier this week. By Wednesday afternoon, another 18 were confirmed positive, a spokesperson for the shelter, Dan Cashman, told the BDN. Of the 21 cases, 17 were guests and four were staff members, Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said Thursday.
Of the outbreaks at congregate care facilities in the state, 76 cases are at the Augusta Center for Health and Rehabilitation; Edgewood Rehabilitation & Living Center is reporting 14 cases; Falmouth by the Sea is reporting 36 cases; the Maine Veterans' Home in Scarborough is reporting 51 cases; the Tall Pines facility is reporting 43 cases; and The Cedars in Portland is reporting 15 cases.
Additionally, the Tyson Foods plant in Portland is reporting 10 cases -- an increase of two cases since Wednesday.
Of the statewide total, 255 cases are health care workers, according to Shah.
So far, 170 Mainers have been hospitalized at some point with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Of those, 35 people are currently hospitalized, with 18 in critical care and eight on ventilators, according to the Maine CDC.
Meanwhile, another 631 people have fully recovered from the coronavirus, meaning there are 411 active cases in the state. That's up from 389 on Wednesday.
A majority of the cases have been in Mainers over age 50, while more cases have been reported in women than men, according to the Maine CDC.
Another 19,546 people have tested negative for the coronavirus, according to the Maine CDC.
Thursday's report comes as the state prepares to gradual relax coronavirus-related restrictions put in place to halt the disease's spread. Under a new order from Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, certain businesses, including barber shops, salons and other personal services, will be permitted to reopen Friday, while keeping in place a ban on gathering of 10 or more people and restrictions on lodgings and other industries into the summer. That will start to ease the economic crunch that has left 108,500 Mainers jobless since March 15 and prompted protests calling on the governor to allow businesses to reopen.
So far, the coronavirus has hit hardest in Cumberland County, where 486 cases have been confirmed and where the bulk of deaths from the virus -- 26 -- have been concentrated. It is one of four counties -- the others are Androscoggin, Penobscot and York, with 48, 78 and 205 cases, respectively -- where "community transmission" has been confirmed, according to the Maine CDC.
There are two criteria for establishing community transmission: at least 10 confirmed cases and that at least 25 percent of those are not connected to either known cases or travel. That second condition has not yet been "satisfied" in other counties.
Other cases have been detected in Aroostook (5), Franklin (27), Hancock (10), Kennebec (104), Knox (16), Lincoln (13), Oxford (15), Piscataquis (1), Sagadahoc (19), Somerset (17), Waldo (48) and Washington (2) counties. Information about where another case was detected was not immediately available Thursday.
As of Thursday afternoon, the coronavirus has sickened 1,054,261 people in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as caused 61,717 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.

Texto completo: Today is Thursday. There have now been 1,056 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus spread across all of Maine's counties, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Health officials confirmed the death of a woman in her 70s from Cumberland County, bringing the statewide death toll to 52.
So far, 166 Mainers have been hospitalized at some point with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, while another 615 people have fully recovered from the coronavirus, meaning there are 389 active cases in the state. That's down from 404 on Tuesday.
Here's the latest on the coronavirus and its impact in Maine:
-- The Maine CDC will provide an update on the coronavirus this afternoon. The BDN will livestream the briefing.
-- Businesses including barber shops, salons and car dealerships can reopen on Friday as part of Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' plan to gradually reopen Maine's economy. The four-phase plan aims to allow businesses to recover from the coronavirus-induced shutdown while preventing a resurgence of the disease. But regulators will not initially verify that the practices are being followed.
-- Frustrated businesses pressed Maine's top economic development official Wednesday on how they will be able to restart under a reopening plan that includes 14-day quarantines for out-of-state tourists and runs through the late summer. The tourism industry, whose hotel, restaurant and bar owners have been hit hard by the economic shutdown and stay-at-home order, has been frustrated by the reopening schedule and lack of details. Certain lodging and campgrounds can open June 1 under stage 2 of the plan for Maine residents and those who have met the 14-day quarantine requirement. More lodging opens up July 1 in stage 3 of the governor's plan, but it also includes quarantines for people entering Maine.
-- Maine's 10 most popular state parks are going to remain closed until at least June 1 under Mills' new executive order that aims to reopen the state's economy. This year's TD Beach to Beacon 10K road race in Cape Elizabeth has been canceled due to concerns about the possible spread of the coronavirus, according to race organizers. Other upcoming events that have been canceled include Bangor's Memorial Day parade, the Maine Lobster Festival and the North Atlantic Blues Festival.
-- A staffing firm that employs some of the doctors in three rural Maine hospitals -- including two that are now in bankruptcy and suing the federal government for stimulus funding -- is reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy itself as a result of steep revenue shortfalls related to the coronavirus. Just as those hospitals have lost considerable revenue after preparing to handle the pandemic, Envision Healthcare Corp. is struggling to pay off $7 billion in debt after the crisis forced medical systems all across the U.S. to delay lucrative elective services.
-- There is now an outbreak of the coronavirus among people who visited the Hope House Health and Living Center in Bangor. Twenty-one homeless shelter residents and staff have tested positive for the virus, the shelter said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, eight cases have been detected at the Tyson Foods plant in Portland, marking the first instance of an outbreak in Maine at a food processing facility.
-- A Guilford company that makes the medical swabs necessary to test for the coronavirus has identified a location in Pittsfield where it would open a second manufacturing facility to help meet the spike in demand for its products. The company, Puritan Medical Products, is now working with a regional organization, Eastern Maine Development Corp., "to identify and hire 140 new production workers in their new manufacturing location," according to Lee Umphrey, EMDC's president and CEO.
-- A federal judge has ruled in favor of a Maine tribe and several others by blocking the U.S. Department of Treasury from distributing federal coronavirus relief funds to a set of for-profit corporations created by tribes in Alaska. However, it's not clear when the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and other federally recognized tribes will receive a portion of the $8 billion set aside for tribal governments in the $2.2 trillion stimulus package.
-- Republican President Donald Trump said Wednesday the federal government's coronavirus social distancing guidelines will be "fading out" when they expire Thursday, counting on states taking charge as they pivot to reopening. The administration says its cautionary guidance issued 45 days ago has been incorporated into recommendations given to the states on how they can begin gradually easing restrictions and reopening their economies.
-- As of early Thursday morning, the coronavirus has sickened 1,040,488 people in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as caused 60,999 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.
-- Elsewhere in New England, there have been 3,405 coronavirus deaths in Massachusetts, 2,168 in Connecticut, 251 in Rhode Island, 60 in New Hampshire and 47 in Vermont.

The federal government is providing $75.5 million to the Guilford medical products company that is expanding production of the testing swabs that are critically needed to detect the coronavirus.
Puritan Medical Products plans to add around 140 new workers to boost production of the swabs at a second location in Pittsfield, the BDN reported Wednesday. Puritan is one of two manufacturers in the world of the nasopharyngeal flocked swabs used to test for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
[image id="2970758" size="full" pos="center" /]
It is partnering with two other large Maine companies, Bath Iron Works and Cianbro, to boost production of the swabs with funds allocated through the federal Defense Production Act. The U.S. Department of Defense said the funding will help Puritan double its swab production at the new facility, where production will start in May.
Bath Iron Works will produce machinery to help with the effort, according to Christopher Knight, a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. It will supply 30 of the 40 machines needed to expand Puritan's production, he said.
BIW spokesperson David Hench said the company is still negotiating a contract for "a short-term job" to produce that equipment for Puritan.
[image id="2970757" size="full" pos="center" /]
"We are proud to join the federal government to help ensure that every American has access to quality testing supplies," said Timothy Templet, Puritan's co-owner and executive vice president of global sales, during an event Thursday afternoon announcing the expansion. "We have an extremely knowledgeable and dedicated team at Puritan, and together with our construction and manufacturing partners here in Maine, and our dedicated employees, we are able to increase our production to meet our national public health needs."
Cianbro owns the building at 129 North Main St. in Pittsfield that will house Puritan's plant, and the contractor will spend the next month working to renovate it for the company's needs, according to Peter Vigue, Cianbro's chairman.
Following the news conference, Vigue said that the facility is expected to stay open past the current pandemic so that Puritan can contribute more testing swabs and other supplies to the nation's stockpile to help prepare for future pandemics.
"Be assured of one thing: 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we will be rebuilding this facility and its ability to provide a manufacturing service that is very, very important to our country," Vigue said.
He also referred to the fact that the Pittsfield plant used to employ about 300 workers who made smoke detectors and other equipment for United Technologies Corp. Fire and Security, but that operation was shuttered in 2014 when the company moved those jobs to locations in North Carolina, Mexico and China.
[image id="2970566" size="full" pos="center" /]
"That left a huge void in this community and in this state, and today it's changing," Vigue said.
Like Vigue, Collins -- who attended the news conference after touring Puritan's Guilford plant earlier on Thursday -- praised the fact that Maine workers and companies are contributing products that are desperately needed as the U.S. responds to the global pandemic.
"We're not importing these swabs from China," she said. "We're not having this manufacturing occuring overseas. It's occurring in the great state of Maine."
The federal contract will boost Puritan's monthly production of swabs by 20 million by the end of May, according to Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesperson.
[image id="2970567" size="full" pos="center" /]
As of March, Puritan was only able to produce up to 1 million of the flocked swabs needed for coronavirus testing each week -- or about 4 million per month -- according to Templet.
The company says it makes more than 1,200 different types of swabs for a variety of industries -- not just those needed for COVID-19 testing. Its swab production of all types normally totals more than 12 million per day, the company said earlier this month in a blog post.
The company employed about 300 people in March, and said earlier this month that it was hiring 30 temporary workers.
Maine's congressional delegation and the nonprofit Eastern Maine Development Corp. have also been helping Puritan Medical Products to procure federal funding and recruit staff to boost its production of swabs, EMDC's president and CEO, Lee Umphrey, said on Wednesday.

Amtrak's Downeaster rail service has been suspended through the end of May amid ongoing efforts to halt the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, which manages the service, announced Wednesday the extension of a temporary service suspension through at least May 31, according to spokesperson Natalie Bogart.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
That move was taken in line with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' gradual phase out of coronavirus-related restrictions. Under that plan, certain businesses, including barber shops, salons and other personal services, will be permitted to reopen Friday, while keeping in place restrictions on lodgings and other industries into the summer. It also requires individuals to wear cloth face coverings in settings where it is difficult to maintain social distancing.
Downeaster passenger rail service has been suspended since April 13, and before that it had been scaled back to a once daily round-trip from Maine to Boston.
Bogart said that preparations are underway to resume service later this spring. Amtrak will have in place when service resumes new public health precautions, including new cleaning protocols, signs promoting physical distancing, and limits on passengers allowed on trains.
Meanwhile, Pan Am Railways is expediting track improvements and maintenance projects along the Downeaster corridor to avoid construction interruptions when service eventually resumes, according to Bogart.

Myles Cloutier, 28, of Hartland was charged with aggravated trafficking in fentanyl, possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and violation of probation; Dustin McKenney, 27, of Skowhegan was charged with aggravated trafficking in fentanyl and violation of probation; and Lindsey Stenson, 23, of Skowhegan was charged with aggravated trafficking in fentanyl, violation of bail and failure to give correct name and address, according to Maine Drug Enforcement Agency Cmdr.

Maine drug agents witnessed Cloutier and the others make a drug transaction on Tuesday, and with assistance from the Maine State Police, they stopped Cloutier's vehicle on Interstate 95, Crandall said.
McKenney and Stenson were passengers in the car, according to Crandall.
He said agents found drugs in the car and a loaded .32-caliber handgun on McKenney, who was barred from possessing firearms under bail conditions. A subsequent search of two rooms at a Palmyra motel turned up 60 grams of suspected fentanyl, two handguns and more than $8,000 in suspect drug proceeds. according to Crandall, who estimated the value of the drugs at $12,000.
Cloutier and McKenney were taken to Somerset County Jail in Madison, where Cloutier is being held on $10,000 bail and McKenney without bail.
Stenson was issued a summons due to unspecified health concerns.

New jobless claims in Maine declined again last week, a report that comes as the state moves to gradually roll back economic restrictions put in place in March to curtail the spread of the new coronavirus.
Mainers submitted 7,420 new jobless claims to the state for the week of April 19 to 25, according to new data the Maine Department of Labor released Thursday morning. Maine workers received $59.7 million in jobless benefits last week, including an additional $600 in assistance under a new federal program launched in response to the pandemic. Since March 15, Mainers have received more than $200 million in benefits, according to the department.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
Total jobless claims over the past four weeks have totaled 63,291, or about 9 percent of Maine's total civilian workforce. Jobless claims peaked the week of March 29 to April 4 at 30,899 new weekly claims. Those claims fell sharply to 13,421 for the week of April 5 to April 11, ending three weeks of record high unemployment filings. Jobless claims for the week ending April 18 totaled 11,561.
Before new restrictions on businesses in the state took effect in March, 634 new jobless claims were filed for the week of March 8 to March 14, according to state data.
"Initial unemployment claims have now declined for three consecutive weeks. While we expect a surge in new claims later this week, this is due to the implementation of the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, not an indication that additional people are losing their employment," the state's labor commissioner, Laura Fortman, said in a statement Thursday morning.
That refers to a new program that will allow unemployed self-employed workers and independent contractors to claim jobless benefits. The expansion of unemployment benefits to self-employed workers and independent contractors, who make up as much as 10 percent of Maine's workforce, passed as part of a federal stimulus package at the end of March. But the Maine Department of Labor has been slow in rolling out the program, citing software development and the need for guidance from the U.S. government.
Those workers can begin to apply for unemployment benefits at 8 a.m. Friday.

In the six weeks from March 15 to April 25, there have been about 108,500 new jobless claims, matching the overall total for the previous 147 weeks combined. New jobless claims are still higher than the state's previous record of 5,634 weekly claims set in January 2009 during the Great Recession, according to state data.
Continued jobless claims for the week ending April 25 were 72,900, up from 66,500 the week before. That is the highest on record and more than twice the peak seen in early 2009 during the recession, the Department of Labor reports.
The industries with the highest jobless claims for the three-week period ending April 25 include food services and lodging, with 13,640; health care and social assistance, with 10,490; retail, with 9,230; and manufacturing, with 7,110, according to the Department of Labor.
Thursday's jobless claims data came a day before coronavirus-related restrictions were set to ease under a plan Democratic Gov. Janet Mills outlined this week. Under that plan, certain businesses, including barber shops, salons and other personal services, will be permitted to reopen Friday, while keeping in place restrictions on lodgings and other industries into the summer. It also requires individuals to wear cloth face coverings in settings where it is difficult to maintain social distancing.
Maine's unemployment rate stood at 3.2 percent in March, compared with 3.2 percent in February and 3.1 percent a year ago. That continues a four-year streak of record low unemployment, but the rate is based on labor force information culled during the week of March 12, before new restrictions curtailed economic activity in Maine to halt the spread of the coronavirus.

Nationally, 3,839,000 Americans filed jobless claims for the week ending April 25, down 603,000 from the previous week's revised total of 4,427,000, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Since the coronavirus outbreak began, more than 30 million Americans have sought jobless benefits to weather the economic slowdown. That's nearly 1 in 6 American workers, the Associated Press reports.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose 1.5 percentage points to 12.4 percent for the week ending April 25, the highest level ever since the seasonally adjusted rate was first compiled, the U.S. Department of Labor said.
That news follows reports from the U.S. Commerce Department that the economy contracted 4.8 percent in the first quarter of the year, which ended in March. It is the sharpest drop since the Great Recession and likely foretells a more grim report for the second quarter when business closures and job losses began to accelerate, according to the Associated Press.

From USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Westville: Dozens of motor vehicles circled the Westville Correctional Facility on Tuesday in a protest over the treatment of inmates during a coronavirus outbreak that has reached inside the prison's walls. "I'm here trying to get justice for all the inmates up here," Misty Weikel said from her car after driving from her home in Lafayette. A sign taped to her car read: "Praying for inmates and guards." Other vehicles circling the prison and honking horns also carried signs. Shouting and clapping could be heard from inside the prison during the protest and individuals were visible at several windows, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. The Westville facility in LaPorte County has far outpaced other Indiana prisons in the number of coronavirus cases. The Indiana Department of Correction reported Tuesday 143 positive tests among inmates and 36 among correctional officers. DOC spokesman Dave Bursten placed the number of vehicles taking part in the protest at more than 70.

Texto completo: Melissa Rusnak remembers returning home exhausted Monday night. In four days, her family-owned pizza restaurant in Union Center was set to reopen for takeout after closing for a month due to health worries.
The Rusnaks spent hours at Brody's Pizza on Union Center Maine Highway, nearly two miles down the road from their home. They tidied up, waxed the floor, and readied some food orders for Friday.
Around 10:45 p.m., after getting back to their Sandra Drive home in West Corners, Melissa sat down on the couch with her husband Jason and their 18-year-old son, and caught up on watching Netflix.
Ten minutes later, the Rusnak's home of 21 years was engulfed in flames.
The five-bedroom ranch style home, tucked into a quiet neighborhood just off Route 26, was declared a total loss.
"A lot of memories there," said Melissa Rusnak, her voice quivering with emotion Wednesday, while she and her husband were in the midst of scouting potential rental homes for their family of eight — they have six children.
"There's not much in the house that's salvageable," she said. They bought the house when they were 18, and it's taken about two days for the weight of their loss to settle in.
Watching a fire rip through your home is like "a really bad dream you don't believe is unfolding in front of you," Melissa Rusnak said.
Now the family is counting their blessings: Everyone made it out safely, they're staying with Melissa's parents who live nearby, and members of the community swiftly rallied to help them rebuild.
A friend launched a Gofundme campaign, which has raised more than $11,000 for the Rusnak family — more than double its original fundraising goal.
Reflecting on the community's generous response makes Melissa Rusnak emotional. "Our community, family and friends are absolutely amazing," she said. "It's humbling, to say the least. I really don't have the words."
How the fire started At 11:10 p.m. Monday, the Rusnak's heard a "pop" coming from the garage.
"What was that?" Melissa remembers saying.
Jason went outside to check, and that's when he saw the orange glow reflecting on one of their vehicles. The fire was building in their garage.
Quickly, they dialed 911, then raced into the other bedrooms to get the younger children out of bed, lead them onto the porch and clear of the house.
Melissa's 18-year-old son grabbed a fire extinguisher. The West Corners fire chief, who lives five houses away, arrived in a hurry.
The fire spread quickly and was upgraded to a second-alarm that drew in neighboring fire departments.
Firefighters managed to extinguish the flames on one side of the residence, and said they were able to prevent the blaze from spreading much further into the house. But there was smoke and water damage.
The fire was believed to be caused by an electrical box in the garage.
Rebuilding a home, reopening a business Melissa Rusnak said her family plans to rebuild their home right where it was, but that could take at least eight months.
Their lives upended, the family had to postpone reopening Brody's Pizza as planned Friday. They hope to welcome back customers in two weeks.
On March 28, they decided to shut down temporarily due to health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic.
They "hemmed and hawed" the decision for a week or two, Melissa recalled, but family health took priority.
The Rusnaks opened Brody's Pizza in February 2019, and it's been their family's main source of income. In addition to family members, the pizza shop has five employees.
Financially, she said, the small restaurant was weathering the limitations placed on businesses during the pandemic. Brody's Pizza had also been distributing free lunches to local students.
That last night before temporarily closing was so busy, Melissa recalled, they ran out of food.

Texto completo: Gov. Janet Mills announced Tuesday that churches could hold drive-in services starting May 1, but some congregations are sticking with online services for now.

Catholic churches in Maine will begin holding drive-in Masses in the coming weeks, a move allowed under Gov. Janet Mills’ phased plan to reopen businesses and churches closed because of the coronavirus.
The first phase of Mills’ reopening plan takes effect on Friday and allows some businesses and outdoor activities to reopen, including drive-in movie theaters and “limited drive-in, stay-in-your-vehicle religious services,” according to the governor’s plan.
The Diocese of Portland on Wednesday announced that Bishop Robert Deeley is permitting the celebration of public Masses in the parking lots of Catholic churches. There will be “strict protocols in place for the protection, safety and health of all participants,” according to the diocese. The first drive-in Masses are scheduled to be held in Auburn and Gorham starting May 9.
But other churches and houses of worship in Maine may hold off on drive-in services until more guidance is provided, or choose to focus instead on continuing online services, according to the Rev. Jane Field, executive director of the Maine Council of Churches. She said there is “deep concern” from Maine Council of Churches leaders about bringing people together in a parking lot, where it could be tempting for some people to get out of their cars to visit with friends.
“It would need to be carefully thought out and carefully planned for,” Field said of drive-in services. “It opens up a host of challenges to keep people safe.”
The Maine Council of Churches plans to release an open letter to Gov. Janet Mills later this week seeking guidance from state health officials in adapting a three-phase model for returning to church based on a plan released by the Wisconsin Council of Churches.
The first drive-in Catholic Masses will be held starting May 9 and 10 in Gorham and Auburn, and the diocese has set up protocols to prevent people from coming too close to each other.
St. Anne Church in Gorham will hold Mass at 5:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:30 a.m. Sunday. The priest will lead Mass from the second story deck of the rectory. Saint Dominic Academy in Auburn will have its Mass at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
The times and locations for other drive-in Masses will be posted on the diocese website and Facebook page as they are scheduled.
During drive-in Catholic Masses, all parishioners must remain in their cars at all times and only people who live in the same household should be in the same vehicle. Cars must have one empty parking space between them in the parking lot and churches will not be open for restroom use.
Deeley announced that social distancing must be maintained by those who minister at drive-in Masses, including celebrants, cantors and lectors. Holy Communion will not be distributed until everyone’s safety can be assured, according to the diocese. Deeley has invited parishioners to instead participate in an Act of Spiritual Communion during Masses.
“This decision to expand the ways in which we gather for worship reflects that Catholics have a deep desire to gather as a faith community, which is essential to our identity as Christians. But I also know that many Catholics, here in Maine, across the nation, and around our world, feel the profound loss of not being able to receive Holy Communion,” Deeley said in a statement. “While it is a great sacrifice not to share in this sign of our unity, it is also a tremendous act of love and charity towards one another, especially the most vulnerable among us. We continue to look forward to a time when it will be possible safely to receive Holy Communion.”
Catholic churches will continue to live-stream services as they have done since March. Parishes will also continue to have drive-through confessions, drive-in adoration and use social media for other programs.

Texto completo: A commissioned work of art to be displayed in the new University of Maine Augusta dormitory.
Artists asked to create piece of art using reclaimed vintage copper sheeting
HALLOWELL — Stevens Commons invites Maine artists to submit proposals for a commissioned work of art to be displayed in the new University of Maine Augusta dormitory, currently under redevelopment in historic Erskine Hall.
Early this year, roofing contractors removed the building’s original copper roof sheeting. In accordance with guiding principles of conservation and support of local arts and culture, Maine artists are invited to submit proposals for the creation of a piece of art using this reclaimed vintage copper sheeting, according to a news release from Kelly Byron with Stevens Commons.
The art should be a wall hanging no bigger than 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet and would have to be completed and ready to install by Aug 1. Stevens Commons would like the current health pandemic to be an inspiring factor in this piece as well to help document these unprecedented times.
A $1,000 commission for this project will be paid directly to the artist, with 50% up front and the balance to be paid when the finished work is delivered.
According to the release, in 2016 Matt Morrill of Mastway Development LLC purchased the Stevens School campus with a focus on cultivating community through conservation, restoration and partnership. The Stevens School, also once known as the Maine Industrial School for Girls, was an education center for wayward girls from 1874 through the mid-1970s.
Recently renamed Stevens Commons, the campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For many years after the school closed, it housed state office buildings and the Department of Corrections Pre-Release Center.
The submission deadline is Monday, May 25, with selection to be announced Monday, June 1.
For more information on this ongoing redevelopment project, visit the Stevens Commons Facebook page.
Interested parties should submit contact information, including website or other social media links, an artist’s CV or resume, a short, written description of idea and a jpg attachment of a concept sketch of initial idea to StevensCopperProject@gmail.com.

Relief and excitement abound

Texto completo: Players can be back on courses Friday, but restrictions will make for a different experience.
The course was closed, and business had been halted. And still, the phone at The Meadows Golf Club continued to ring.
“During the whole month of April, I bet I got no fewer than three calls a day, asking if we were open and had tee times available,” course owner Randall Anderson said. “I was like ‘I don’t know what rock you live under, but man, we’re down. The whole state’s closed.’ “
The sport got good news Tuesday, however, as Gov. Janet Mills’s plan for re-opening the state allowed courses to resume play Friday, provided they stick to social distancing parameters and guidelines that make the game more conducive to safety.
“I would say (we’re) relieved, and happy,” Natanis Golf Course manager Rob Browne said. “We’ve had nothing coming in, and even with restrictions we’re going at least be able to start the process of recouping a little bit here. As soon as (Mills) mentioned the golf courses were open, the phone rang off the hook.”
“If our state leaders feel as though we can do this safely, that’s obviously a step in the right direction,” Waterville Country Club general manager Nick Pelotte added, “not necessarily just for golf courses and for the industry we’re in, but for everyone in general.”
The announcement came as welcome news for players who saw their favorite form of recreation closed down for a month, and who were unsure when it would be back.
“I got a text from a buddy of mine (and) I said ‘I don’t care, rain or shine, we’re playing,’ “ Lakewood Golf Course member Heath Cowan said. “Three o’clock Friday, Lakewood, first tee. I don’t care how hard it’s raining, he and I are going to be out there.”
“You can only swing a club on your lawn so many times,” Natanis member Marsha Adams added. “I honestly was concerned, not just for myself but for a lot of people I know. There are a lot of people that need it. It’s very therapeutic.”
At the same time, players knew there was a reason for the shutdown. Eddie Scholz lives right next to Natanis, and felt the itch like everyone else to get out and play. But at 80 years old, Scholz knew the danger the coronavirus presents, and understood Mills’s decision to close non-essential businesses at the start of April.
“I can understand the concern because this is nothing to fool with, especially someone my age,” Scholz said. “When you’re 80 years old and you have a breathing problem, it’s very scary. But I think now’s the time to open up. I’m not too concerned. You’re in the wide-open spaces.”
Courses are making changes to become even safer. The Maine State Golf Association came out with a “Park, Play & Go Home” initiative, which tells golfers to book tee times, show up 10 minutes beforehand, practice social distancing on the course and leave immediately after finishing. Courses are also taking additional measures, including no flagsticks, no rakes in the bunkers, no ball washers, no clubhouse or restroom access, and tee times scheduled 10 to 15 minutes apart.
“It’s not going to be ‘business as usual.’ It’s going to be ‘business unusual,’ “ Augusta Country Club general manager Dave Soucy said. “It is going to certainly change the experience, but the world has changed. We can’t expect golf not to change, so it’s going to be different. There’s going to be an adjustment period.”
Players are prepared for a unique feel to the game.
“It’s different. It’s weird to take an approach shot into a green and not know where the hole is,” Adams said. “But hey, it adds to the challenge.”
Anderson at The Meadows said courses will err on the side of caution.
“We’ll probably do even more than they’re asking for,” he said. “We’re dealing with a situation that’s very important and serious, and the last thing we want to do is have a number of rogue courses to kind of jeopardize it for us all.”
Those restrictions, he said, are worth putting up with to be able to re-open.
“Golf is a very difficult business to break even at anyway,” Anderson said. “We had some absolutely stunningly gorgeous weeks and weekends that we lost for this, so opening May 1 is a huge development for us. Absolutely monstrous.”
That doesn’t mean all courses are in the clear. A destination course like Belgrade Lakes Golf Club often draws visitors from throughout New England and beyond. With the two-week quarantine order in place for people coming into the state, Belgrade general manager Kyle Evans expects to see his course take a hit.
“The whole tourism thing, I’m still concerned about that as well,” he said. “We get a lot of our business from other states. How that all comes out in the wash is yet to be seen, I guess.”
There’s a similar dynamic at Waterville, where Pelotte said not all members are full-time Maine residents.
“Typically, vacations or weekend getaways don’t last as long as 14 days,” he said. “It’ll be difficult to come up here, quarantine for 14 days, and then have any availability to play golf.”
Not all hurdles are virus-related. Evans and Pelotte said their courses are in excellent shape, while Mike Dugas, owner and manager of JW Parks Golf Course in Pittsfield, said the recent windstorms left a lot of downed limbs and trees to clean up first.
“The governor gave us clearance, but I’m not sure Mother Nature did,” he said.
Dugas said players should gauge their own caution and comfort before returning to the course.
“Just because I’m open doesn’t mean people have to come play,” he said. “The onus of responsibility lies with the individual.”
Evans said most players can’t get out soon enough.
“The course is in the best shape it’s ever been in at this time of year,” he said. “I think people are pent up. They can’t wait to get outside and do the things they love.”

Texto completo: Health care providers, car dealerships, hair salon owners and others weigh in on what it will mean to open as part of Gov. Mills' four-stage plan.

Businesses allowed to get back to work Friday as part of Gov. Janet Mills’ four-stage plan for reopening will proceed with caution, follow safety protocols and maintain social distancing guidelines, business owners said Wednesday.
Businesses allowed to reopen to the public with mandated restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic include hair salons, car dealerships and health care providers, though health care settings have remained open but with dialed back activities.

HOSPITALS MaineGeneral Health did not close its physician practices and other offices, though it dialed back the way it operated, according to Chuck Hays, chief executive officer of MaineGeneral Health, the parent organization of MaineGeneral Medical Center.
MaineGeneral is planning to dial up services on Monday rather than Friday, May 1, he said. Patients who are well but have chronic conditions that need to be addressed will be seen in the mornings and sicker patients will be seen in the afternoons, according to Hays.
Waiting rooms are being reconfigured so people are separated, Hays said. When people enter physicians practices and offices for orthopedics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, dermatology and the like, they will be asked questions and their temperatures will be taken, he said.
“We are asking people to come in with their own face coverings, and if they don’t have one when they come in, we’ll provide them with a mask,” Hays said.
All employees will be required to wear face masks, and cleaning throughout facilities will continue, he said.
Mammography screenings will start again as it is important to catch cancer diagnoses, according to Hays. Services including endoscopy, cardiology screenings, cancer screenings and so forth will open. Blood labs have remained open. Imaging activities including X-rays and CT scans, unless urgent, had been dialed back but will be reopened.
“On May 11 we will start opening up semi-urgent surgeries at Thayer Center for Health (in Waterville) first,” Hays said. “Our plan is to start at Thayer Center for Health’s operating room May 11.”
Emergency surgeries are being performed at Alfond Center for Health in Augusta and, based on how the semi-urgent surgeries go at Thayer, officials will determine when to open the Augusta hospital to semi-urgent surgeries, such as one for a slow-growing cancer, according to Hays.
Hays noted that, as more services are opening up, officials will continuously monitor the situation for a possible uptick in COVID-19 patients.
Tim Dentry, president and chief executive officer of Northern Light Health, said in a statement Wednesday that day one of Northern Light’s plan is Friday.
“Rest assured that first and foremost we are ensuring strict infection prevention precautions including, but not limited to, universal face-coverings, temperature checks, and maintaining a strict visitor policy,” he said.
Like MaineGeneral locations, Northern Light Health facilities remained open and Dentry said what Northern Light is returning to is “greater ability to prioritize the needs of those patients who have been waiting for procedures that are medically necessary but not emergent.”
Terri Vieira, president of Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital in Pittsfield, said in the statement that the locations will start scheduling services based on criteria that supports needs and the system’s ability to do so safely.
“We are being very thoughtful and moving forward with caution as we focus on safety, while recognizing there is a pent-up demand for services,” she said.
People entering Northern Light facilities will be screened for temperature and COVID symptoms upon entry, and all patients are required to wear masks as well as practice social distancing where possible.
Facilities continue to offer services via telehealth appointments for patients, Vieira said.
“It’s clear that telehealth is now an important part of how we deliver care going forward. Inland Hospital’s Walk-In Care office at 174 Kennedy Memorial Drive continues to welcome patients for nonemergency care. We also encourage patients to use the patient portal to communicate with their provider.”
In the meantime, Vieira said, those needing emergency care should call 911 immediately, and those needing routine care should contact their healthcare providers.
“Our very restricted visitor policies remain in effect at Inland Hospital, Sebasticook Valley Hospital, and at Northern Light Continuing Care, Lakewood,” she said. “This is for the safety of our most vulnerable residents and patients.”

DEALERSHIPS
Central Maine Motors Auto Group’s showroom on Kennedy Memorial Drive in Waterville has been closed to the public for the last six weeks but will reopen Friday and the number of customers allowed in at one time will be limited, according to owner Chris Gaunce.
“We feel ready and prepared to open,” Gaunce said Wednesday.
Central Maine Motors has been working with customers online and by appointment, digitizing its financial process and conducting as much business as possible outside the facility, Gaunce said. While the showroom has been closed, the parts and service departments have remained open, and a crew of three has been disinfecting and cleaning buildings four times a day, he said. Doors have been propped open so people do not have to touch them, and workers have been asked to socially distance themselves. Gaunce said he anticipates there will be a need for use of masks and installation of plexiglass in certain areas.
“A lot of it is stuff to empower us to help us live our lives a little bit more normally,” he said.
Gaunce said the only thing that concerns him is that the education everyone has received about social distancing and so forth will not be applied if people become apathetic and emotionally frustrated with the protocols required because of the coronavirus situation. It is important people continue with that protocol, as the virus is not going to go away, he said.
Charlie’s Family of Dealerships, which has locations in Augusta and Winthrop, has continued to sell cars — online and over the phone — since nonessential businesses were closed by executive order. On Friday, however, the dealerships’ showrooms will open back up for limited numbers of people at a time.
Steve Shuman, Charlie’s vice president and general manager, plans to keep most business outside.
“As much business as I can do outside, social distancing with masks on, we’re going to do,” he added. “We’re going to take all the cars out of the showroom, so if people are in there, it will be easier for them to be spread out. We’re going to be as safe as we can.”
Shuman said his staff also are wearing gloves and have a protocol for sanitizing every car.
“We’re going to conduct some training Thursday afternoon for what we’re looking to wipe down on cars, so everyone is clear,” he said. “Basically, all the customer contact parts.”
“We’re still zero customer contact in the service department,” Shuman added. “We are accepting appointments and walk-ins, but the service managers are meeting everyone through the drop slot.”
In Skowhegan, Sam Hight of Hight Ford said that even though strict regulations have been in place because of the virus, the business has been able to keep all 100 of its employees employed full-time.
Hight Ford, which has been family owned and operated since 1911, has kept its business running through online sales and through its parts and services garage.
“For us as an organization, it wasn’t too much of a change because we already do a lot over-the-phone and remotely, and our sales have always been low pressure,” Hight said. “When you come into one of our dealerships, (the customer) only works with one sales person.”
Changes that the business has made in the last six weeks include continued cleaning and disinfecting of facilities, adding barriers at service desks to allow for safe social distancing, using steering wheel covers, disinfecting vehicles and keys after being handled, spreading out waiting room seating and following social distancing guidelines.
On Friday, Hight said that though doors will open but restrictions will still be in place, such as only allowing five to eight customers in the facility at a time. Sales over the phone and online are still encouraged.
Where social distancing can’t be safely practiced, Hight said that employees will be equipped with face masks and other appropriate equipment. “We are asking customers to stay home if they are not feeling well. We can handle everything over the phone.”
Before coming to the show room, customers are recommended to schedule their appointments ahead of time to ensure that not too many people will be in the facility at once.
“We as car dealers feel very fortunate that we were included on Stage 1,” Hight said.
To keep employees busy when business was slow, he said they worked to keep facilities clean and did other odd jobs around the office, such as painting.

SALONS
Lisa Breton, owner of Studio 61 on Silver Street in Waterville, plans to have a soft opening Friday, but is being cautious and will allow only one or two clients in the salon at a time.
“I am a little nervous,” said Breton, who has owned the salon 25 years. “We haven’t gotten the guidelines yet. I, personally, think it’s too soon to open, especially since the governor extended the stay-at-home order to be until May 31. I was really shocked that she said we could practice doing hair. We’re very close to our clients.”
Nail technicians can not return to work until June 1 as part of the plan and hair stylists work just as closely to clients as nail workers, she said. Two of the five people who work in her salon have decided not to return to work.
“They’re not ready and I understand that,” she said.
Breton said she is thrilled that people who are self-employed now will be able to return to work, but it will be a struggle because they can not do the same amount of work that they did previously. Breton is in a better position than some because she owns the building her salon is in, she said. The people who work there rent their booths, which is the practice for many salons in the area.
William Dangler, owner of People’s Salon & Spa on Temple Street in Waterville, plans to reopen Friday with only hair stylists and a front desk person. People who provide other services will be allowed to come back to work in phases two and three of the governor’s plan for reopening businesses, he said.
“We can’t have nail techs, skin specialists or massage therapists,” Dangler said Wednesday.
Normally, 17 to 18 people work in the salon, but during the first phase, there will be five hairdressers, five clients and the front desk person, according to Dangler.
“People have to stay in their cars until they’re summonsed to come in,” he said.
Dangler said the salon has been ramping up to reopen, scheduling clients and changing scheduling so the salon operates on shift work, which allows everyone an opportunity to work, and a cleaning protocol will be in place.
“It’s mandatory — everyone wears a mask, clients as well as staff — and we have to sanitize between each client,” Dangler said.
Linda Puckett, owner of Linda’s Cutting Edge Hair Salon and Day Spa at 160 Water St. in Randolph, said she was nervous opening up, but she needed the income from her job. “With no income, going on 7 weeks, no unemployment, nothing, we need money.”
Puckett said she closed down her salon just before a mandate came down from Gov. Janet Mills.
“The minute the governor said that she recommended the salons, or anybody that touches the face or the hands shut down, I shut down,” Puckett said.
Puckett said five people usually work at the salon, but some will not return until later phases of the reopening plan. She said she would like to have only one person in the salon at a time, followed by a cleaning of her station, before getting another customer from the parking lot.
Puckett said she has been stocking up on capes, masks and other equipment at Randolph Hardware in preparation for opening.

RELIGIOUS SERVICES
Beginning on Friday, religious institutions are allowed to offer drive-in, stay-in-your-vehicle services.
Centerpoint Community Church in Waterville will hold its first drive-in service at 10 a.m. Sunday. The service will also be broadcast through a transmitter for the radio as well as live streamed to its Facebook page.
The Diocese of Portland announced it would allow parishes across the state to begin holding drive-in services, but outlined rules for the gatherings:
• Holy Communion will not be distributed until a safe protocol can be developed.
• All parishioners will remain in their cars at all times.
• Only people who live together should be in the same vehicle.
• Churches and facilities will not be open for restroom use.
• Social distancing must be maintained by those who minister at these Masses.
• Cars must have one empty parking space between them in the parking lot.
• Collections will not be held during the Mass; instead parishioners are encouraged to donate to their parish online or by mail.

OTHERS
Lisa Hawkes, owner of Happy Tails Pet Grooming at 445 Litchfield Road in Farmingdale, said she has a backlog of 100 customers ready to book appointments after five weeks off.
“It’s going to be crazy,” she said. “Some of those appointments I had in the books, but a lot of them are appointments of people who were trying to call me when I was out.”
Hawkes said she will not be allowing humans into her business, and she will be wearing a mask and gloves while grooming the animals.
“The only way I would be concerned (for my health) is if a customer of mine had it and … sneezed or coughed on their dog,” she said. “I just don’t think we know enough about it, so I think better to play it safe than sorry.”
According to Darryll White, the chief administrator of Lake George Regional Park that shares shorelines with Canaan and Skowhegan, the Lake George Regional Park Board determined Tuesday to open the park in accordance with the first stage of Mills’ plan.
The board has stated its intent to ensure safe use of the park. The park will not be staffed until Memorial Day weekend. Visitors now may enter using their season pass or pay into the Ranger box and are expected to be responsible for social distancing and other safety protocol.

Maine’s Catholic churches can hold drive-in Masses

Texto completo: Gov. Janet Mills announced Tuesday that churches could hold drive-in services starting May 1, but some congregations are sticking with online services for now.

Catholic churches in Maine will begin holding drive-in Masses in the coming weeks, a move allowed under Gov. Janet Mills’ phased plan to reopen businesses and churches closed because of the coronavirus.
The first phase of Mills’ reopening plan takes effect on Friday and allows some businesses and outdoor activities to reopen, including drive-in movie theaters and “limited drive-in, stay-in-your-vehicle religious services,” according to the governor’s plan.
The Diocese of Portland on Wednesday announced that Bishop Robert Deeley is permitting the celebration of public Masses in the parking lots of Catholic churches. There will be “strict protocols in place for the protection, safety and health of all participants,” according to the diocese. The first drive-in Masses are scheduled to be held in Auburn and Gorham starting May 9.
But other churches and houses of worship in Maine may hold off on drive-in services until more guidance is provided, or choose to focus instead on continuing online services, according to the Rev. Jane Field, executive director of the Maine Council of Churches. She said there is “deep concern” from Maine Council of Churches leaders about bringing people together in a parking lot, where it could be tempting for some people to get out of their cars to visit with friends.
“It would need to be carefully thought out and carefully planned for,” Field said of drive-in services. “It opens up a host of challenges to keep people safe.”
The Maine Council of Churches plans to release an open letter to Gov. Janet Mills later this week seeking guidance from state health officials in adapting a three-phase model for returning to church based on a plan released by the Wisconsin Council of Churches.
The first drive-in Catholic Masses will be held starting May 9 and 10 in Gorham and Auburn, and the diocese has set up protocols to prevent people from coming too close to each other.
St. Anne Church in Gorham will hold Mass at 5:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:30 a.m. Sunday. The priest will lead Mass from the second story deck of the rectory. Saint Dominic Academy in Auburn will have its Mass at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
The times and locations for other drive-in Masses will be posted on the diocese website and Facebook page as they are scheduled.
During drive-in Catholic Masses, all parishioners must remain in their cars at all times and only people who live in the same household should be in the same vehicle. Cars must have one empty parking space between them in the parking lot and churches will not be open for restroom use.
Deeley announced that social distancing must be maintained by those who minister at drive-in Masses, including celebrants, cantors and lectors. Holy Communion will not be distributed until everyone’s safety can be assured, according to the diocese. Deeley has invited parishioners to instead participate in an Act of Spiritual Communion during Masses.
“This decision to expand the ways in which we gather for worship reflects that Catholics have a deep desire to gather as a faith community, which is essential to our identity as Christians. But I also know that many Catholics, here in Maine, across the nation, and around our world, feel the profound loss of not being able to receive Holy Communion,” Deeley said in a statement. “While it is a great sacrifice not to share in this sign of our unity, it is also a tremendous act of love and charity towards one another, especially the most vulnerable among us. We continue to look forward to a time when it will be possible safely to receive Holy Communion.”
Catholic churches will continue to live-stream services as they have done since March. Parishes will also continue to have drive-through confessions, drive-in adoration and use social media for other programs.

Maine reopens, but New Hampshire waits on Massachusetts

Texto completo: The Keene Sentinel
With Maine golf courses set to open Friday, New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts are the three New England states with courses still closed and no set date to resume play.
While it’s true the return of golf in New Hampshire may be around the corner, with limitations, there is still no set date for that return.
Gov. Chris Sununu said in an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio that the state will take a phased-in business approach. In Maine, opening golf courses was part of phase one in reopening its businesses and, according to Bretwood Golf Course owner Chuck Shortsleeve, he is anticipating that to be the same case in the Granite State.
A state task force is expected to make recommendations on the first steps to bring the economy back to life this week, Sununu said in a news conference Monday. Shortsleeve believes the stay-at-home order may be extended past May 4, the current date. Maine’s stay-at-home order, recently extended to May 31, did not impact the reopening of golf courses, providing hope for New Hampshire courses even if Sununu extends the stay-at-home order date.
The big deterrent to opening the courses has not been New Hampshire itself. On Tuesday, Massachusetts reported single-day totals of 1,840 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 150 deaths caused by the disease. To put those numbers into perspective, New Hampshire has had in total 2,010 confirmed cases and 60 deaths related to COVID-19 according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.
“Based on everything I’ve heard from people in the know, he’s very concerned about Massachusetts not opening and everybody from Mass(achusetts) coming up here with people that potentially have coronavirus,” Shortsleeve said. “If Mass opened today, (Sununu) would probably open this afternoon.”
Dartmouth College earlier this month decided to keep Hanover Country Club closed for the year.
The N.H. Golf Association, N.H. Golf Course Superintendent Association, National Golf Course Owners Association, Professional Golfers Association of America, Professional Golfers Association New England Section and Professional Golfers Association New England Section New Hampshire Chapter have all collaborated to determine the best way to move forward with the golfing season.
In a PDF on the N.H. Golf Association website, it states that golf is “good for people, good for the Granite State.” The association points to golf burning calories, preventing chronic illnesses, stimulating the economy, giving back to the community, providing developmental programs for the youth, providing jobs, boosting tourism and being accessible and inclusive to the public as reasons golf should be allowed.
The PDF also dives deep into the proposed phase approach to the reopening, found at the N.H. Golf Association website. Some expected limitations include people having to call in and pay for whatever they want ahead of time, including food and drinks. There also is not expected to be alcohol served during the early phase of reopening the courses, according to Shortsleeve. Bretwood is planning to offer takeout service and will also limit bathroom access.
Shortsleeve said the goal is to have golfers park, play their round of golf and then head back home.
It is not a question of whether the courses are ready.
“I have been here pretty regularly; we are maintaining the golf course daily,” he said. “It is probably the best it has been in a while because nobody has been using it. All the grass is cut, and all the greens are ready. We are ready for folks to come in. We are just going to have to do some social distancing. That is going to require some work on our part, but we are willing to do it. We want to get open.”

Beach to Beacon called off

Texto completo: 'It's really the only right decision,' race founder Joan Benoit Samuelson says of calling off one of Maine's premier summer events.
With the Tokyo Olympics postponed for a year and most major road races postponed or canceled, Joan Benoit Samuelson was hoping the 2020 TD Beach to Beacon 10K road race in Cape Elizabeth could be “one of the bright lights of the summer.”
Instead, Maine’s largest road race became the latest sporting event to be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced on Wednesday.
Founded by Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic women’s marathon gold medalist, the race had been held annually since 1998 and has become one of Maine’s premier events each summer. This year’s race was scheduled for Aug. 1.
“It’s really the only right decision,” said Samuelson. “It was a gut-wrenching decision. But there are people enduring hardships beyond what you or I can comprehend and we needed to take that into consideration. This is the year we had to look at the larger community and say, ‘This is what we need to do.’”
The announcement came a day after Gov. Janet Mills released her four-stage plan to reopen the state’s economy. Even on July 31, the plan tentatively would prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people. More than 6,500 runners registered for this year’s Beach to Beacon.
“It was difficult on an emotional level but it wasn’t difficult on a rational level,” said race president David Backer. “It was a decision we knew we had to make, as much as it pained all of us to make it. I think now more than ever people need these celebrations of life to buoy their spirits. We all view the Beach to Beacon as a celebration of fitness and life. It’s a fun gathering and a celebration of life.
“The size of it made it inevitable, the decision to cancel it.”
Backer said the $55 registration fee would be refunded to all those who registered. And all 2020 registrants will receive the opportunity for early entry into the 2021 race.
“We recognize when people registered in mid-March it was with the knowledge that the pandemic was spreading and there was at least some chance the race would not be held,” he said. “But the fact that the race filled up as quickly as it did shows people were simply hopeful there would be a way for this event to happen and people would have a way to get together and celebrate fitness. We thought it was important to refund the fees.”
Race officials also said that the 2020 race beneficiary, JMG, will remain the beneficiary for the 2021 race.
Samuelson and race director Dave McGillivray, also the race director of the Boston Marathon, said they considered postponing the race until the fall. But Samuelson said, “There were too many unknowns, too much uncertainty. We decided to put all our energy into next year.”
“I think one of the difficulties with a postponement is, still, the uncertainty,” said McGillivray. “You don’t want to postpone something, then have to cancel it. Secondly, finding the right date becomes an issue. It’s a summer event. You put it into the fall, or early winter if you went into November, then what does it actually become? You could tone it down to the bare basics … but the consensus was, we want the race to be what everyone has built the race to be, and not anything less. Let’s think of other ways to celebrate running at the time.”
Many prominent road races have already been pushed into the fall, including the Boston Marathon, now scheduled for Sept. 14.
Samuelson said moving the race into the fall presented other issues including finding a date that didn’t to go head-to-head with any school or club events on a weekend or finding enough volunteers in the fall rather than the summer. “There were so many considerations,” she said. “When you put everything on the table, the most prudent decision was to take it off the books this year and come back stronger than ever before in 2021.”
Over the years, the race has grown considerably, from an inaugural field of 3,000 runners to well over 6,000. Last year’s race had 6,413 finishers.
It has become one of the most prestigious 10Ks in the nation, drawing elite runners from across the globe and the U.S.
“Joanie has done an incredible job building it up,” said runner Rob Gomez, who is also on the race’s board of directors. “The decision to cancel the Beach to Beacon will be felt not only in Maine, but across the region and the country. But I think everyone will understand given the circumstances.”
Gomez, 36, was involved in one of the race’s most dramatic and memorable finishes in 2017, when he picked up leader Jesse Orach, who had collapsed within yards of the finish line, and pushed him across first.
“As any runner involved with Beach to Beacon, you want the race to go on,” said Gomez. “But the safety of everyone involved, whether runners, spectators, volunteers or sponsors, means more than running a race. If you’re not sure the race can be safe for everyone participating in it, it’s impossible to hold it.”
Larry Wold is one of the race’s 103 legacy runners, those who have run the 6.2 miles every year. He is also the Maine president of TD Bank, the race’s primary sponsor.
The decision to cancel, he said, is hard, especially for those runners looking to race in what is considered the unofficial Maine 10K championship. But looking at the bigger picture was much more important.
“You don’t want to be unwise about it,” he said. “You just don’t. This race is surrounded by so much good. It’s not just the good athletes who made this such a special event. In fact, the elite runners become bit players in it. Its impact on the larger community will be felt, not just on those who run.”
And losing the race for a year, he said, may strengthen the bonds of the volunteers, sponsors and host families.
“As a sponsor, we’ve given so many people the opportunity to make a contribution to this race, either as a runner, spectator, sponsor,” he said. “This may provide an opportunity to give them another way to channel that good to something else for a year. And I think they will appreciate the race that much more a year from now, and in so many ways strengthen the race.”
McGillivray said race officials are looking to find a way to celebrate the event even if it can’t be run.
“We’re going to spend the next few months figuring out what we can do to keep people connected and to support local charities,” he said. “We’re going to do something. It won’t be a road race, but it will be something.”

Texto completo: A 14-day isolation requirement for people coming into the state through August would deal a crippling blow to the state's summer tourism businesses.
Isolation requirement for people entering state through August would deal blow to business

Some businesses in Maine’s gigantic tourism industry worry a state mandate for out-of-state visitors to self-quarantine for two weeks would effectively cancel the state’s critical summer season.
It is unlikely many tourists would be interested in a vacation that involves staying inside their hotel room or rented home, said Maine Tourism Association CEO Tony Cameron.
The multibillion-dollar industry wants to reopen the right way, and the health and safety of guests and staff is top of mind for everyone, Cameron said.
At the same time, there is deep concern and anxiety about the plan put forward by Gov. Janet Mills, and the industry wants clarity to feel comfortable that it can succeed this year, he said.
“We are trying to figure out what this means and move forward,” Cameron said. “We need to get a lot of clarification and better understanding to what it means so we can have a successful tourism season — it is imperative for Maine for that to happen.”
Members of the Mills’ administration presented a softer stance on the quarantine requirement Wednesday.
Among possible tools to curtail the spread of coronavirus, a mandated self-quarantine is what’s available to the state now, but in the coming months more options may emerge to test and identify potential carriers, said state Economic and Community Development Commissioner Heather Johnson in a news conference.
“Quarantine is a last-case choice,” Johnson said. “We are actively looking at some other choices that we aren’t ready to be able to talk through yet. But I think there will be choices.”
Dr. Nirav Shah, the state Center for Disease Control & Prevention Director, said scientific data would lead the way on testing strategy and ways to keep people safe.
Quarantine “casts a very, very broad and wide net, and as a result, it’s going to be a bit over-inclusive,” Shah said. “Our goal is to try to come up with a more targeted, more finely refined and defined approach to how we can target individuals who are coming into the state.”
Under the state’s phased economic recovery plan unveiled Tuesday, Maine’s lodging and tourism businesses would be among the last to reopen, not until July or August at the earliest.
Lodging and campgrounds could be open to Maine residents and people who have met the 14-day isolation requirement by June 1. Lodging could reopen to visitors starting in July, but the quarantine requirement would remain.
Hotels and other lodgings should not take reservations until the Mills’ administration issues guidelines to help them reopen safely, according to the plan.
The quarantine for out-of-state visitors is intended to prevent the spread of coronavirus from hot spots such as the Boston area and New York City to Maine, which has so far prevented the virus from overwhelming its health care system.
Unfortunately, those areas are also major sources of the state’s tourists. Maine had more than 37 million out-of-state visits in 2019, three-quarters of them during the summer.
Direct tourism spending exceeded $6 billion last year, roughly 11% of the state’s gross domestic product. The tourism and hospitality industry supports a host of other industries across the state.
Allyson Cavaretta, principal at the Meadomere Resort in Ogunquit, is among a chorus of voices in the hospitality industry asking for clarity on the reopening plan.
A quarantine “is not a reasonable position for the tourism industry to succeed,” she said.
Visitors are not going to come to Maine for two weeks to stay in their hotel, and most people don’t visit for that long anyway, she added.
The average stay for overnight visitors in 2018 was about four nights, according to an annual survey from the Maine Office of Tourism.
Cavaretta worries visitors will avoid Maine and choose states with fewer restrictions.
“I hope they just get to come, they don’t have to make that choice,” she said.
Summer tourism spending is critical to local economies and the state’s bottom line.
Almost $802 million was spent on Maine accommodations between June and September of last year, 64% the annual total, according to the state’s tax agency. Diners spent more than $1.3 billion in restaurants over the same period, nearly half the annual spending.
Some of those visitors are likely to stay away this season.
The Paradise Park Resort Campground in Old Orchard Beach was flooded with requests to cancel reservations after Mills extended the out-of-state isolation order, said owner Mike Halle.
“They feel like there is no way for them to meet the criteria for the reopening plan, and they think summer is canceled,” Halle said.
Most of his guests are return visitors who book a week-long family vacation a year in advance, Halle said. About 90% of his bookings are at risk.
Halle said he agreed with Mills’ decision to extend a stay-at-home order until the end of May and would support a cautious approach through June. He and his staff were working on protocols to keep workers, guests and neighbors safe.
But extending a strict self-quarantine rule through July and August is going to hurt his business and his city, an iconic Maine summertime destination, Halle said.
“I think the governor just said Maine is in good shape — the only way to screw that up is to open it up to out-of-state people,” he said. “Give us a little credit for being responsible business people and give us a chance to bring customers in safely.”
A DECD spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the quarantine rule and guidance the department is developing for businesses.
Chip Gray, owner of the Harraseeket Inn in Freeport, said he’s already taking care of out-of-state guests. Essential workers from New York and Massachusetts stayed at the hotel while working on municipal well projects and repairing power lines after a recent spring storm, he said.
The hotel has stepped up sanitation, giving rooms a deep clean after every guest leaves, practicing social distancing in the lobby and public areas, and doing everything it can to keep people safe.
“A balance can be arrived at allowing the out-of-state visitor with the correct safety protocols in place to protect the population and keep the economic fabric of Maine’s society whole,” Gray said.

Texto completo: Many owners stress golfers still need to practice social distancing and to respect the rules.
approach on reopening
Owner Cathy McDevitt is ready to open CR Farm Disc Golf in West Gardiner on Friday, although she acknowledged questions still linger after Gov. Janet Mills unveiled a complex plan to reopen Maine’s sagging economy earlier this week.
Golf courses and disc golf courses are allowed to open Friday under the first phase of Gov. Mills’ plan.
“I still have plenty of questions for them,” said McDevitt, who owns the course with her husband, Randy. “Like porta-potties. Is there going to be issues with (trash), because on every hole we have trash cans and recycling cans. Is that going to be some kind of an issue? There’s still things to question about what we can and cannot do.”
McDevitt hopes to get some questions answered during a Thursday Zoom meeting with Heather Johnson, the commissioner of the Maine Department of Economic Community Development.
In the meantime, she said that while CR Farm Disc Golf will open Friday, the pro shop will be closed.
“I’m definitely not opening up my pro shop,” Cathy McDevitt said. “It’s pretty much going to be an honor box, or PayPal, or maybe me sitting in the pro shop handing stuff out the window for debit cards, possibly, down the road. But it’s still all up in the air right now as what we can and can’t do.”
Augusta Golf Park owner Greg Cyr said he, too, plans to keep his pro shop closed, but added he’s confident golfers will be able to keep social distancing when the course reopens.
“Disc golf is pretty secluded,” Cyr said. “As long as you keep the groups of people separated. We have an outdoor honor box where they sign in — and they don’t even have to sign in — I give them the option of paying me with either PayPal or Venmo, it’s right on the door… At my particular course, there’s a lot of families that come (to play) with their kids. They come up, they do their sign-in and then they go out to the course and they’re literally hundreds of feet away from everybody else. It’s pretty secluded at that point.”
Friday couldn’t come any sooner for several courses, as April is typically a busy month, said Tom “Moose” Tillson of DND Disc Golf of Sidney.
“It’s the busiest (month),” he said “It’s warm enough to play, there’s no bugs. It’s actually the best disc golf. We missed prime time, and I’ve been closed seven weeks, not just a month.”
“We lost out on our peak season, because everyone is eager to get out,” Cyr added. “Once the snow disappears, we consider this our peak season. Everyone comes in a hurry to get out and do it and rush. Typically what happens every year, if we can get opened up the first of April, we typically almost always have about three weeks of good weather, in which we saw but, unfortunately, we were closed during the best part of the month of April.”
Rick Burns, who owns Burnsboro Disc Golf in Vassalboro, planned to host a Maine Player’s Tour event on his course on April 18, which he said was one of the biggest pay days of the year.
“I was supposed to have 100 people there,” Burns said. “It was the MPT kickoff, I’ve done for, I don’t know, 14 years in a row… I’m the first (tournament) at the beginning of the year, because my course always dries up quicker than everybody else. We missed out on that tournament, and that was a guaranteed $1,000 for me that I lost. … I’m looking forward to constant traffic, but now the bugs are out.”
Disc golfers had already been reaching out to owners to see if they’d be open.
“We just had somebody parked out here,” said Tillson. “I guess they’re not understanding that (reopening) is Friday.”
“They’re driving me crazy already,” McDevitt added. “(They ask) ‘Are you going to be opening anytime soon?’ And I ask ‘Have you watched the news? Do you pay attention to what’s going on?… We’re just as excited as they are.”
All the owners agreed that pace of play on the course will have to remain steady, and that golfers will have to respect the new rules.
“If people can really, really concentrate on following the rules, there shouldn’t be an issue,” McDevitt said.
“You’re going to have to play steady,” Tillson added. “That way everybody who wants to get in can play, and you don’t want to be passing people. We’re going to have to keep doing the social distancing of six feet. I will enforce that as need be. If I see people that can’t abide by the rules, then they’re just going to have to play in their own back yard.”

Stage 1 reopenings of businesses, services in Central Maine will be cautious

Texto completo: Health care providers, car dealerships, hair salon owners and others weigh in on what it will mean to open as part of Gov. Mills' four-stage plan.

Businesses allowed to get back to work Friday as part of Gov. Janet Mills’ four-stage plan for reopening will proceed with caution, follow safety protocols and maintain social distancing guidelines, business owners said Wednesday.
Businesses allowed to reopen to the public with mandated restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic include hair salons, car dealerships and health care providers, though health care settings have remained open but with dialed back activities.

HOSPITALS MaineGeneral Health did not close its physician practices and other offices, though it dialed back the way it operated, according to Chuck Hays, chief executive officer of MaineGeneral Health, the parent organization of MaineGeneral Medical Center.
MaineGeneral is planning to dial up services on Monday rather than Friday, May 1, he said. Patients who are well but have chronic conditions that need to be addressed will be seen in the mornings and sicker patients will be seen in the afternoons, according to Hays.
Waiting rooms are being reconfigured so people are separated, Hays said. When people enter physicians practices and offices for orthopedics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, dermatology and the like, they will be asked questions and their temperatures will be taken, he said.
“We are asking people to come in with their own face coverings, and if they don’t have one when they come in, we’ll provide them with a mask,” Hays said.
All employees will be required to wear face masks, and cleaning throughout facilities will continue, he said.
Mammography screenings will start again as it is important to catch cancer diagnoses, according to Hays. Services including endoscopy, cardiology screenings, cancer screenings and so forth will open. Blood labs have remained open. Imaging activities including X-rays and CT scans, unless urgent, had been dialed back but will be reopened.
“On May 11 we will start opening up semi-urgent surgeries at Thayer Center for Health (in Waterville) first,” Hays said. “Our plan is to start at Thayer Center for Health’s operating room May 11.”
Emergency surgeries are being performed at Alfond Center for Health in Augusta and, based on how the semi-urgent surgeries go at Thayer, officials will determine when to open the Augusta hospital to semi-urgent surgeries, such as one for a slow-growing cancer, according to Hays.
Hays noted that, as more services are opening up, officials will continuously monitor the situation for a possible uptick in COVID-19 patients.
Tim Dentry, president and chief executive officer of Northern Light Health, said in a statement Wednesday that day one of Northern Light’s plan is Friday.
“Rest assured that first and foremost we are ensuring strict infection prevention precautions including, but not limited to, universal face-coverings, temperature checks, and maintaining a strict visitor policy,” he said.
Like MaineGeneral locations, Northern Light Health facilities remained open and Dentry said what Northern Light is returning to is “greater ability to prioritize the needs of those patients who have been waiting for procedures that are medically necessary but not emergent.”
Terri Vieira, president of Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital in Pittsfield, said in the statement that the locations will start scheduling services based on criteria that supports needs and the system’s ability to do so safely.
“We are being very thoughtful and moving forward with caution as we focus on safety, while recognizing there is a pent-up demand for services,” she said.
People entering Northern Light facilities will be screened for temperature and COVID symptoms upon entry, and all patients are required to wear masks as well as practice social distancing where possible.
Facilities continue to offer services via telehealth appointments for patients, Vieira said.
“It’s clear that telehealth is now an important part of how we deliver care going forward. Inland Hospital’s Walk-In Care office at 174 Kennedy Memorial Drive continues to welcome patients for nonemergency care. We also encourage patients to use the patient portal to communicate with their provider.”
In the meantime, Vieira said, those needing emergency care should call 911 immediately, and those needing routine care should contact their healthcare providers.
“Our very restricted visitor policies remain in effect at Inland Hospital, Sebasticook Valley Hospital, and at Northern Light Continuing Care, Lakewood,” she said. “This is for the safety of our most vulnerable residents and patients.”

DEALERSHIPS Central Maine Motors Auto Group’s showroom on Kennedy Memorial Drive in Waterville has been closed to the public for the last six weeks but will reopen Friday and the number of customers allowed in at one time will be limited, according to owner Chris Gaunce.
“We feel ready and prepared to open,” Gaunce said Wednesday.
Central Maine Motors has been working with customers online and by appointment, digitizing its financial process and conducting as much business as possible outside the facility, Gaunce said. While the showroom has been closed, the parts and service departments have remained open, and a crew of three has been disinfecting and cleaning buildings four times a day, he said. Doors have been propped open so people do not have to touch them, and workers have been asked to socially distance themselves. Gaunce said he anticipates there will be a need for use of masks and installation of plexiglass in certain areas.
“A lot of it is stuff to empower us to help us live our lives a little bit more normally,” he said.
Gaunce said the only thing that concerns him is that the education everyone has received about social distancing and so forth will not be applied if people become apathetic and emotionally frustrated with the protocols required because of the coronavirus situation. It is important people continue with that protocol, as the virus is not going to go away, he said.
Charlie’s Family of Dealerships, which has locations in Augusta and Winthrop, has continued to sell cars — online and over the phone — since nonessential businesses were closed by executive order. On Friday, however, the dealerships’ showrooms will open back up for limited numbers of people at a time.
Steve Shuman, Charlie’s vice president and general manager, plans to keep most business outside.
“As much business as I can do outside, social distancing with masks on, we’re going to do,” he added. “We’re going to take all the cars out of the showroom, so if people are in there, it will be easier for them to be spread out. We’re going to be as safe as we can.”
Shuman said his staff also are wearing gloves and have a protocol for sanitizing every car.
“We’re going to conduct some training Thursday afternoon for what we’re looking to wipe down on cars, so everyone is clear,” he said. “Basically, all the customer contact parts.”
“We’re still zero customer contact in the service department,” Shuman added. “We are accepting appointments and walk-ins, but the service managers are meeting everyone through the drop slot.”
In Skowhegan, Sam Hight of Hight Ford said that even though strict regulations have been in place because of the virus, the business has been able to keep all 100 of its employees employed full-time.
Hight Ford, which has been family owned and operated since 1911, has kept its business running through online sales and through its parts and services garage.
“For us as an organization, it wasn’t too much of a change because we already do a lot over-the-phone and remotely, and our sales have always been low pressure,” Hight said. “When you come into one of our dealerships, (the customer) only works with one sales person.”
Changes that the business has made in the last six weeks include continued cleaning and disinfecting of facilities, adding barriers at service desks to allow for safe social distancing, using steering wheel covers, disinfecting vehicles and keys after being handled, spreading out waiting room seating and following social distancing guidelines.
On Friday, Hight said that though doors will open but restrictions will still be in place, such as only allowing five to eight customers in the facility at a time. Sales over the phone and online are still encouraged.
Where social distancing can’t be safely practiced, Hight said that employees will be equipped with face masks and other appropriate equipment. “We are asking customers to stay home if they are not feeling well. We can handle everything over the phone.”
Before coming to the show room, customers are recommended to schedule their appointments ahead of time to ensure that not too many people will be in the facility at once.
“We as car dealers feel very fortunate that we were included on Stage 1,” Hight said.
To keep employees busy when business was slow, he said they worked to keep facilities clean and did other odd jobs around the office, such as painting.

SALONS Lisa Breton, owner of Studio 61 on Silver Street in Waterville, plans to have a soft opening Friday, but is being cautious and will allow only one or two clients in the salon at a time.
“I am a little nervous,” said Breton, who has owned the salon 25 years. “We haven’t gotten the guidelines yet. I, personally, think it’s too soon to open, especially since the governor extended the stay-at-home order to be until May 31. I was really shocked that she said we could practice doing hair. We’re very close to our clients.”
Nail technicians can not return to work until June 1 as part of the plan and hair stylists work just as closely to clients as nail workers, she said. Two of the five people who work in her salon have decided not to return to work.
“They’re not ready and I understand that,” she said.
Breton said she is thrilled that people who are self-employed now will be able to return to work, but it will be a struggle because they can not do the same amount of work that they did previously. Breton is in a better position than some because she owns the building her salon is in, she said. The people who work there rent their booths, which is the practice for many salons in the area.
William Dangler, owner of People’s Salon & Spa on Temple Street in Waterville, plans to reopen Friday with only hair stylists and a front desk person. People who provide other services will be allowed to come back to work in phases two and three of the governor’s plan for reopening businesses, he said.
“We can’t have nail techs, skin specialists or massage therapists,” Dangler said Wednesday.
Normally, 17 to 18 people work in the salon, but during the first phase, there will be five hairdressers, five clients and the front desk person, according to Dangler.
“People have to stay in their cars until they’re summonsed to come in,” he said.
Dangler said the salon has been ramping up to reopen, scheduling clients and changing scheduling so the salon operates on shift work, which allows everyone an opportunity to work, and a cleaning protocol will be in place.
“It’s mandatory — everyone wears a mask, clients as well as staff — and we have to sanitize between each client,” Dangler said.
Linda Puckett, owner of Linda’s Cutting Edge Hair Salon and Day Spa at 160 Water St. in Randolph, said she was nervous opening up, but she needed the income from her job. “With no income, going on 7 weeks, no unemployment, nothing, we need money.”
Puckett said she closed down her salon just before a mandate came down from Gov. Janet Mills.
“The minute the governor said that she recommended the salons, or anybody that touches the face or the hands shut down, I shut down,” Puckett said.
Puckett said five people usually work at the salon, but some will not return until later phases of the reopening plan. She said she would like to have only one person in the salon at a time, followed by a cleaning of her station, before getting another customer from the parking lot.
Puckett said she has been stocking up on capes, masks and other equipment at Randolph Hardware in preparation for opening.

RELIGIOUS SERVICES Beginning on Friday, religious institutions are allowed to offer drive-in, stay-in-your-vehicle services.
Centerpoint Community Church in Waterville will hold its first drive-in service at 10 a.m. Sunday. The service will also be broadcast through a transmitter for the radio as well as live streamed to its Facebook page.
The Diocese of Portland announced it would allow parishes across the state to begin holding drive-in services, but outlined rules for the gatherings:
• Holy Communion will not be distributed until a safe protocol can be developed.
• All parishioners will remain in their cars at all times.
• Only people who live together should be in the same vehicle.
• Churches and facilities will not be open for restroom use.
• Social distancing must be maintained by those who minister at these Masses.
• Cars must have one empty parking space between them in the parking lot.

OTHERS Lisa Hawkes, owner of Happy Tails Pet Grooming at 445 Litchfield Road in Farmingdale, said she has a backlog of 100 customers ready to book appointments after five weeks off.
“It’s going to be crazy,” she said. “Some of those appointments I had in the books, but a lot of them are appointments of people who were trying to call me when I was out.”
Hawkes said she will not be allowing humans into her business, and she will be wearing a mask and gloves while grooming the animals.
“The only way I would be concerned (for my health) is if a customer of mine had it and … sneezed or coughed on their dog,” she said. “I just don’t think we know enough about it, so I think better to play it safe than sorry.”
According to Darryll White, the chief administrator of Lake George Regional Park that shares shorelines with Canaan and Skowhegan, the Lake George Regional Park Board determined Tuesday to open the park in accordance with the first stage of Mills’ plan.
The board has stated its intent to ensure safe use of the park. The park will not be staffed until Memorial Day weekend. Visitors now may enter using their season pass or pay into the Ranger box and are expected to be responsible for social distancing and other safety protocol.

Artists asked to create piece of art using reclaimed vintage copper sheeting
HALLOWELL — Stevens Commons invites Maine artists to submit proposals for a commissioned work of art to be displayed in the new University of Maine Augusta dormitory, currently under redevelopment in historic Erskine Hall.
Early this year, roofing contractors removed the building’s original copper roof sheeting. In accordance with guiding principles of conservation and support of local arts and culture, Maine artists are invited to submit proposals for the creation of a piece of art using this reclaimed vintage copper sheeting, according to a news release from Kelly Byron with Stevens Commons.
The art should be a wall hanging no bigger than 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet and would have to be completed and ready to install by Aug 1. Stevens Commons would like the current health pandemic to be an inspiring factor in this piece as well to help document these unprecedented times.
A $1,000 commission for this project will be paid directly to the artist, with 50% up front and the balance to be paid when the finished work is delivered.
According to the release, in 2016 Matt Morrill of Mastway Development LLC purchased the Stevens School campus with a focus on cultivating community through conservation, restoration and partnership. The Stevens School, also once known as the Maine Industrial School for Girls, was an education center for wayward girls from 1874 through the mid-1970s.
Recently renamed Stevens Commons, the campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For many years after the school closed, it housed state office buildings and the Department of Corrections Pre-Release Center.
The submission deadline is Monday, May 25, with selection to be announced Monday, June 1.
For more information on this ongoing redevelopment project, visit the Stevens Commons Facebook page.
Interested parties should submit contact information, including website or other social media links, an artist’s CV or resume, a short, written description of idea and a jpg attachment of a concept sketch of initial idea to StevensCopperProject@gmail.com.

Texto completo: Many owners stress golfers still need to practice social distancing and to respect the rules.
approach on reopening
Owner Cathy McDevitt is ready to open CR Farm Disc Golf in West Gardiner on Friday, although she acknowledged questions still linger after Gov. Janet Mills unveiled a complex plan to reopen Maine’s sagging economy earlier this week.
Golf courses and disc golf courses are allowed to open Friday under the first phase of Gov. Mills’ plan.
“I still have plenty of questions for them,” said McDevitt, who owns the course with her husband, Randy. “Like porta-potties. Is there going to be issues with (trash), because on every hole we have trash cans and recycling cans. Is that going to be some kind of an issue? There’s still things to question about what we can and cannot do.”
McDevitt hopes to get some questions answered during a Thursday Zoom meeting with Heather Johnson, the commissioner of the Maine Department of Economic Community Development.
In the meantime, she said that while CR Farm Disc Golf will open Friday, the pro shop will be closed.
“I’m definitely not opening up my pro shop,” Cathy McDevitt said. “It’s pretty much going to be an honor box, or PayPal, or maybe me sitting in the pro shop handing stuff out the window for debit cards, possibly, down the road. But it’s still all up in the air right now as what we can and can’t do.”
Augusta Golf Park owner Greg Cyr said he, too, plans to keep his pro shop closed, but added he’s confident golfers will be able to keep social distancing when the course reopens.
“Disc golf is pretty secluded,” Cyr said. “As long as you keep the groups of people separated. We have an outdoor honor box where they sign in — and they don’t even have to sign in — I give them the option of paying me with either PayPal or Venmo, it’s right on the door… At my particular course, there’s a lot of families that come (to play) with their kids. They come up, they do their sign-in and then they go out to the course and they’re literally hundreds of feet away from everybody else. It’s pretty secluded at that point.”
Friday couldn’t come any sooner for several courses, as April is typically a busy month, said Tom “Moose” Tillson of DND Disc Golf of Sidney.
“It’s the busiest (month),” he said “It’s warm enough to play, there’s no bugs. It’s actually the best disc golf. We missed prime time, and I’ve been closed seven weeks, not just a month.”
“We lost out on our peak season, because everyone is eager to get out,” Cyr added. “Once the snow disappears, we consider this our peak season. Everyone comes in a hurry to get out and do it and rush. Typically what happens every year, if we can get opened up the first of April, we typically almost always have about three weeks of good weather, in which we saw but, unfortunately, we were closed during the best part of the month of April.”
Rick Burns, who owns Burnsboro Disc Golf in Vassalboro, planned to host a Maine Player’s Tour event on his course on April 18, which he said was one of the biggest pay days of the year.
“I was supposed to have 100 people there,” Burns said. “It was the MPT kickoff, I’ve done for, I don’t know, 14 years in a row… I’m the first (tournament) at the beginning of the year, because my course always dries up quicker than everybody else. We missed out on that tournament, and that was a guaranteed $1,000 for me that I lost. … I’m looking forward to constant traffic, but now the bugs are out.”
Disc golfers had already been reaching out to owners to see if they’d be open.
“We just had somebody parked out here,” said Tillson. “I guess they’re not understanding that (reopening) is Friday.”
“They’re driving me crazy already,” McDevitt added. “(They ask) ‘Are you going to be opening anytime soon?’ And I ask ‘Have you watched the news? Do you pay attention to what’s going on?… We’re just as excited as they are.”
All the owners agreed that pace of play on the course will have to remain steady, and that golfers will have to respect the new rules.
“If people can really, really concentrate on following the rules, there shouldn’t be an issue,” McDevitt said.
“You’re going to have to play steady,” Tillson added. “That way everybody who wants to get in can play, and you don’t want to be passing people. We’re going to have to keep doing the social distancing of six feet. I will enforce that as need be. If I see people that can’t abide by the rules, then they’re just going to have to play in their own back yard.”

Tourism industry wary about quarantine rule

Texto completo: A 14-day isolation requirement for people coming into the state through August would deal a crippling blow to the state's summer tourism businesses.
Isolation requirement for people entering state through August would deal blow to business

Some businesses in Maine’s gigantic tourism industry worry a state mandate for out-of-state visitors to self-quarantine for two weeks would effectively cancel the state’s critical summer season.
It is unlikely many tourists would be interested in a vacation that involves staying inside their hotel room or rented home, said Maine Tourism Association CEO Tony Cameron.
The multibillion-dollar industry wants to reopen the right way, and the health and safety of guests and staff is top of mind for everyone, Cameron said.
At the same time, there is deep concern and anxiety about the plan put forward by Gov. Janet Mills, and the industry wants clarity to feel comfortable that it can succeed this year, he said.
“We are trying to figure out what this means and move forward,” Cameron said. “We need to get a lot of clarification and better understanding to what it means so we can have a successful tourism season — it is imperative for Maine for that to happen.”
Members of the Mills’ administration presented a softer stance on the quarantine requirement Wednesday.
Among possible tools to curtail the spread of coronavirus, a mandated self-quarantine is what’s available to the state now, but in the coming months more options may emerge to test and identify potential carriers, said state Economic and Community Development Commissioner Heather Johnson in a news conference.
“Quarantine is a last-case choice,” Johnson said. “We are actively looking at some other choices that we aren’t ready to be able to talk through yet. But I think there will be choices.”
Dr. Nirav Shah, the state Center for Disease Control & Prevention Director, said scientific data would lead the way on testing strategy and ways to keep people safe.
Quarantine “casts a very, very broad and wide net, and as a result, it’s going to be a bit over-inclusive,” Shah said. “Our goal is to try to come up with a more targeted, more finely refined and defined approach to how we can target individuals who are coming into the state.”
Under the state’s phased economic recovery plan unveiled Tuesday, Maine’s lodging and tourism businesses would be among the last to reopen, not until July or August at the earliest.
Lodging and campgrounds could be open to Maine residents and people who have met the 14-day isolation requirement by June 1. Lodging could reopen to visitors starting in July, but the quarantine requirement would remain.
Hotels and other lodgings should not take reservations until the Mills’ administration issues guidelines to help them reopen safely, according to the plan.
The quarantine for out-of-state visitors is intended to prevent the spread of coronavirus from hot spots such as the Boston area and New York City to Maine, which has so far prevented the virus from overwhelming its health care system.
Unfortunately, those areas are also major sources of the state’s tourists. Maine had more than 37 million out-of-state visits in 2019, three-quarters of them during the summer.
Direct tourism spending exceeded $6 billion last year, roughly 11% of the state’s gross domestic product. The tourism and hospitality industry supports a host of other industries across the state.
Allyson Cavaretta, principal at the Meadomere Resort in Ogunquit, is among a chorus of voices in the hospitality industry asking for clarity on the reopening plan.
A quarantine “is not a reasonable position for the tourism industry to succeed,” she said.
Visitors are not going to come to Maine for two weeks to stay in their hotel, and most people don’t visit for that long anyway, she added.
The average stay for overnight visitors in 2018 was about four nights, according to an annual survey from the Maine Office of Tourism.
Cavaretta worries visitors will avoid Maine and choose states with fewer restrictions.
“I hope they just get to come, they don’t have to make that choice,” she said.
Summer tourism spending is critical to local economies and the state’s bottom line.
Almost $802 million was spent on Maine accommodations between June and September of last year, 64% the annual total, according to the state’s tax agency. Diners spent more than $1.3 billion in restaurants over the same period, nearly half the annual spending.
Some of those visitors are likely to stay away this season.
The Paradise Park Resort Campground in Old Orchard Beach was flooded with requests to cancel reservations after Mills extended the out-of-state isolation order, said owner Mike Halle.
“They feel like there is no way for them to meet the criteria for the reopening plan, and they think summer is canceled,” Halle said.
Most of his guests are return visitors who book a week-long family vacation a year in advance, Halle said. About 90% of his bookings are at risk.
Halle said he agreed with Mills’ decision to extend a stay-at-home order until the end of May and would support a cautious approach through June. He and his staff were working on protocols to keep workers, guests and neighbors safe.
But extending a strict self-quarantine rule through July and August is going to hurt his business and his city, an iconic Maine summertime destination, Halle said.
“I think the governor just said Maine is in good shape — the only way to screw that up is to open it up to out-of-state people,” he said. “Give us a little credit for being responsible business people and give us a chance to bring customers in safely.”
A DECD spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the quarantine rule and guidance the department is developing for businesses.
Chip Gray, owner of the Harraseeket Inn in Freeport, said he’s already taking care of out-of-state guests. Essential workers from New York and Massachusetts stayed at the hotel while working on municipal well projects and repairing power lines after a recent spring storm, he said.
The hotel has stepped up sanitation, giving rooms a deep clean after every guest leaves, practicing social distancing in the lobby and public areas, and doing everything it can to keep people safe.
“A balance can be arrived at allowing the out-of-state visitor with the correct safety protocols in place to protect the population and keep the economic fabric of Maine’s society whole,” Gray said.

Texto completo: Players can be back on courses Friday, but restrictions will make for a different experience.
The course was closed, and business had been halted. And still, the phone at The Meadows Golf Club continued to ring.
“During the whole month of April, I bet I got no fewer than three calls a day, asking if we were open and had tee times available,” course owner Randall Anderson said. “I was like ‘I don’t know what rock you live under, but man, we’re down. The whole state’s closed.’ “
The sport got good news Tuesday, however, as Gov. Janet Mills’s plan for re-opening the state allowed courses to resume play Friday, provided they stick to social distancing parameters and guidelines that make the game more conducive to safety.
“I would say (we’re) relieved, and happy,” Natanis Golf Course manager Rob Browne said. “We’ve had nothing coming in, and even with restrictions we’re going at least be able to start the process of recouping a little bit here. As soon as (Mills) mentioned the golf courses were open, the phone rang off the hook.”
“If our state leaders feel as though we can do this safely, that’s obviously a step in the right direction,” Waterville Country Club general manager Nick Pelotte added, “not necessarily just for golf courses and for the industry we’re in, but for everyone in general.”
The announcement came as welcome news for players who saw their favorite form of recreation closed down for a month, and who were unsure when it would be back.
“I got a text from a buddy of mine (and) I said ‘I don’t care, rain or shine, we’re playing,’ “ Lakewood Golf Course member Heath Cowan said. “Three o’clock Friday, Lakewood, first tee. I don’t care how hard it’s raining, he and I are going to be out there.”
“You can only swing a club on your lawn so many times,” Natanis member Marsha Adams added. “I honestly was concerned, not just for myself but for a lot of people I know. There are a lot of people that need it. It’s very therapeutic.”
At the same time, players knew there was a reason for the shutdown. Eddie Scholz lives right next to Natanis, and felt the itch like everyone else to get out and play. But at 80 years old, Scholz knew the danger the coronavirus presents, and understood Mills’s decision to close non-essential businesses at the start of April.
“I can understand the concern because this is nothing to fool with, especially someone my age,” Scholz said. “When you’re 80 years old and you have a breathing problem, it’s very scary. But I think now’s the time to open up. I’m not too concerned. You’re in the wide-open spaces.”
Courses are making changes to become even safer. The Maine State Golf Association came out with a “Park, Play & Go Home” initiative, which tells golfers to book tee times, show up 10 minutes beforehand, practice social distancing on the course and leave immediately after finishing. Courses are also taking additional measures, including no flagsticks, no rakes in the bunkers, no ball washers, no clubhouse or restroom access, and tee times scheduled 10 to 15 minutes apart.
“It’s not going to be ‘business as usual.’ It’s going to be ‘business unusual,’ “ Augusta Country Club general manager Dave Soucy said. “It is going to certainly change the experience, but the world has changed. We can’t expect golf not to change, so it’s going to be different. There’s going to be an adjustment period.”
Players are prepared for a unique feel to the game.
“It’s different. It’s weird to take an approach shot into a green and not know where the hole is,” Adams said. “But hey, it adds to the challenge.”
Anderson at The Meadows said courses will err on the side of caution.
“We’ll probably do even more than they’re asking for,” he said. “We’re dealing with a situation that’s very important and serious, and the last thing we want to do is have a number of rogue courses to kind of jeopardize it for us all.”
Those restrictions, he said, are worth putting up with to be able to re-open.
“Golf is a very difficult business to break even at anyway,” Anderson said. “We had some absolutely stunningly gorgeous weeks and weekends that we lost for this, so opening May 1 is a huge development for us. Absolutely monstrous.”
That doesn’t mean all courses are in the clear. A destination course like Belgrade Lakes Golf Club often draws visitors from throughout New England and beyond. With the two-week quarantine order in place for people coming into the state, Belgrade general manager Kyle Evans expects to see his course take a hit.
“The whole tourism thing, I’m still concerned about that as well,” he said. “We get a lot of our business from other states. How that all comes out in the wash is yet to be seen, I guess.”
There’s a similar dynamic at Waterville, where Pelotte said not all members are full-time Maine residents.
“Typically, vacations or weekend getaways don’t last as long as 14 days,” he said. “It’ll be difficult to come up here, quarantine for 14 days, and then have any availability to play golf.”
Not all hurdles are virus-related. Evans and Pelotte said their courses are in excellent shape, while Mike Dugas, owner and manager of JW Parks Golf Course in Pittsfield, said the recent windstorms left a lot of downed limbs and trees to clean up first.
“The governor gave us clearance, but I’m not sure Mother Nature did,” he said.
Dugas said players should gauge their own caution and comfort before returning to the course.
“Just because I’m open doesn’t mean people have to come play,” he said. “The onus of responsibility lies with the individual.”
Evans said most players can’t get out soon enough.
“The course is in the best shape it’s ever been in at this time of year,” he said. “I think people are pent up. They can’t wait to get outside and do the things they love.”

Texto completo: Regular exercise combats the double whammy of inactivity and isolation that can cause or worsen many physical and mental health problems.

Susan Henderson knows the value of regular exercise.
A retired nursing professor and South Portland city councilor, she’s had a gym membership for years. She’s aware of the cardiovascular, weight-control and other health benefits of working out at any age, especially for people over age 50. She and her late husband, Scott Hatch, used to go together.
But her gym has been closed during the coronavirus pandemic, so Henderson is making sure she gets out of the house once or twice each day to take her dog, Serenia, for a rigorous walk.
“Getting outdoors has always been a coping mechanism for me,” said Henderson, 78. “It normalizes my day, even in the best of times. But now it’s about moving my body and staying as healthy as I can during this difficult time.”
Many older Mainers are staying home to avoid contracting COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. And with good reason.
Older people and individuals with underlying health issues such as heart, lung or liver disease and diabetes, are considered especially vulnerable to the virus; 658 of 1,040 confirmed cases in Maine (63%) and all 51 deaths here have been among people age 50 and older.
Inactivity and isolation are a double whammy that can cause or worsen physical and mental health problems, including high blood pressure, arthritis, depression and anxiety. Conversely, even modest regular exercise can help reduce health complaints and improve a person’s ability to cope during a stress-inducing pandemic.
“Whether you do it indoors or outdoors, get your body moving,” said Marilyn Gugliucci, professor and director of geriatrics research at the University of New England’s medical school.
For people with mobility issues, Gugliucci recommended exercises that can be done sitting or standing with stationary support, such as a chair or railing. For others, she suggested workouts that can be done without risking injury at a time when seeking medical care can be challenging.
“Do what you can. Exercise with intention,” Gugliucci said. “If you’re sitting at home, start with knee lifts. Work from head to toe. Go through the full range of motion.”
A variety of fitness instruction videos and programs for in-home workouts is available on TV and online. Henderson took an online strength and balance class offered by her gym. Maine Public television airs yoga or stretch classes daily at 6:30 a.m.
During the pandemic, Hannah LeBlanc, a fitness specialist with UNE’s Exercise and Conditioning for Easier Living (U-ExCEL) program for older adults, has produced several free workout videos that are posted on YouTube and shared through the Maine Council on Aging’s COVID-19 information updates.
LeBlanc’s videos build on previous Balancing Act videos that also were produced for the U-ExCEL program and feature Gugliucci demonstrating the exercises.
LeBlanc demonstrates and explains the exercises in her videos, including “Strength and Balance,” which increases core, upper- and lower-body strength; “Sit and Fit,” which improves all-over strength and flexibility while sitting; and “Core Dynamics,” which targets abdominal muscles, back, hips and buttocks.
“Remember,” LeBlanc tells participants in one video, “listen to your body and only do what’s comfortable for you.”
LeBlanc usually leads a variety of fitness classes at Piper Shores, a retirement community in Scarborough. During the pandemic, the campus has been closed and all group activities have been canceled, leaving residents to find other ways to stay active.
Some are using LeBlanc’s videos, while others are joining her on daily walks around the tree-lined campus while staying at least 6 feet apart.
“Exercise is a key factor in living longer, moving with confidence and staying independent,” LeBlanc said. “It can reduce or delay many chronic health conditions and reduces the risk of falling, which can trigger a variety of other health problems. And it reduces stress, which is probably most important at a time like this.”
Judy Young is a Piper Shores resident who has joined LeBlanc on guided walkabouts, though she usually goes for a brisk walk at least once a day on her own. She’s a former physical education teacher and professor of kinesiology — the science of body movement — who spent her career promoting fitness.
“I know how to exercise, but I’m interested now more than during my career in the benefits for seniors,” said Young, 77. “In order to have a good quality of life as we get older, we have to be more attentive to our health.”
In addition to previously mentioned benefits, Young noted that exercise boosts the immune system, endurance and attitude, all of which would be especially helpful during the pandemic.
“It keeps you able to continue doing the things you love and support other people in your life,” Young said. “You’re taking care of yourself.”
For Susan Henderson, the South Portland city councilor, the previously perfunctory activity of walking her dog is also proving to have significant mental health benefits during the pandemic.
On a recent hike through one of South Portland’s wooded parks, Henderson recalled the Japanese concept of shinrin-yoku or “forest bathing,” which recognizes that being surrounded by trees can promote health and happiness.
“We passed a brook. We passed a pond. Every care left me,” Henderson said. “It was just wonderful.”

state's parks and beaches to be closed at least through June 1

Texto completo: Maine's most popular state parks will remain closed until at least June 1 under a new executive order from Gov. Janet Mills that aims to reopen the state's economy in stages while guarding against the spread of the coronavirus.
The parks, mostly located along the state's central and southern coasts, are tourist hot spots with some of the largest beaches in northern New England.
The Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands released a detailed list Wednesday of the coastal state parks. The parks were first closed March 27 because of concerns that visitors were not following guidelines for social distancing as outlined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"Overcrowding at those parks when they were open made it increasingly difficult for the public to implement appropriate physical distancing," Jim Britt, a spokesman for the Bureau of Parks and Lands, said Wednesday. "As a result, the department closed those select coastal parks and beaches and is monitoring visitation at all state parks."
The closed parks and sites are: Reid State Park, Popham Beach State Park, Fort Popham, Fort Baldwin, Kettle Cove State Park, Two Lights State Park, Crescent Beach State Park, Scarborough Beach State Park, Ferry Beach State Park and Mackworth Island.
Several southern Maine municipalities with public beaches have also closed them in response to the pandemic. In March, the towns of Wells, Ogunquit, Kittery and York all announced their beaches would be closed to the public after crowding there fueled concerns that visitors would spread the virus.
Maine has 48 state parks and historic sites, and visitation surged at parks that remained open for day use following the earlier closure of the beach parks.
Mills on Tuesday announced a plan to gradually reopen the state. It includes opening state parks and public lands for day use only, but noted that most of the state's coastal parks would remain shuttered until at least June 1 and possibly longer if the number of COVID-19 cases in Maine surges again or the severity of cases becomes worse.
"Closing any of our state parks is the last thing we want to do," Britt said. "We are keeping as many parks as possible open, and we encourage people to look for ways to take much-needed breaks in the outdoors that allow them to avoid crowded places and maintain physical distancing. "

Tourism industry worries about lost summer A 14-day quarantine requirement for people coming into the state through August would deal a crippling blow to Maine's lucrative economic sector.

Texto completo: Some businesses in Maine's gigantic tourism industry worry a state mandate for out-of-state visitors to self-quarantine for two weeks would effectively cancel the state's critical summer season.
It is unlikely many tourists would be interested in a vacation that involves staying inside their hotel room or rented home, said Maine Tourism Association CEO Tony Cameron.
The multibillion-dollar industry wants to reopen the right way, and the health and safety of guests and staff is top of mind for everyone, Cameron said.
At the same time, there is deep concern and anxiety about the plan put forward by Gov. Janet Mills, and the industry wants clarity to feel comfortable that it can succeed this year, he said.
"We are trying to figure out what this means and move forward," Cameron said. "We need to get a lot of clarification and better understanding to what it means so we can have a successful tourism season - it is imperative for Maine for that to happen."ˆ
Members of the Mills' administration presented a softer stance on the quarantine requirement Wednesday.
Among possible tools to curtail the spread of coronavirus, a mandated self-quarantine is what's available to the state now, but in the coming months more options may emerge to test and identify potential carriers, Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Heather Johnson said in a news conference.
"Quarantine is a last-case choice," Johnson said. "We are actively looking at some other choices that we aren't ready to be able to talk through yet. But I think there will be choices."
HOLD OFF ON TAKING RESERVATIONS
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said scientific data would lead the way on testing strategy and ways to keep people safe.
Quarantine "casts a very, very broad and wide net, and as a result, it's going to be a bit over-inclusive," Shah said. "Our goal is to try to come up with a more targeted, more finely refined and defined approach to how we can target individuals who are coming into the state."
Shah didn't specify which data points the state would use to guide its strategy.
Under the state's phased economic recovery plan unveiled Tuesday, Maine's lodging and tourism businesses would be among the last to reopen, not until July or August at the earliest.
Lodging and campgrounds could be open to Maine residents and people who have met the 14-day isolation requirement by June 1. Lodging could reopen to visitors starting in July, but the quarantine requirement would remain.
Hotels and other lodgings should not take reservations until the Mills' administration issues guidelines to help them reopen safely, according to the plan.
The quarantine for out-of-state visitors is intended to prevent the spread of coronavirus from hot spots such as the Boston area and New York City to Maine, which has so far prevented the virus from overwhelming its health care system.
Unfortunately, those areas are also major sources of the state's tourists. Maine had more than 37 million out-of-state visits in 2019, three-quarters of them during the summer.
Direct tourism spending exceeded $6 billion last year, roughly 11 percent of the state's gross domestic product. The tourism and hospitality industry supports a host of other industries across the state.
Allyson Cavaretta, principal at the Meadowmere Resort in Ogunquit, is among a chorus of voices in the hospitality industry asking for clarity on the reopening plan.
A quarantine "is not a reasonable position for the tourism industry to succeed," she said.
'THEY THINK THE SUMMER IS CANCELED'
Visitors are not going to come to Maine for two weeks to stay in their hotel, and most people don't visit for that long anyway, she added.
The average stay for overnight visitors in 2018 was about 4 nights, according to an annual survey from the Maine Office of Tourism.
Cavaretta worries visitors will avoid Maine and choose states with fewer restrictions.
"I hope they just get to come, they don't have to make that choice," she said.
Summer tourism spending is critical to local economies and the state's bottom line.
Almost $802 million was spent on Maine accommodations between June and September of last year, 64 percent the annual total, according to the state's tax agency. Diners spent more than $1.3 billion in restaurants over the same period, nearly half the annual spending.
Some of those visitors are likely to stay away this season.
The Paradise Park Resort Campground in Old Orchard Beach was flooded with requests to cancel reservations after Mills extended the out-of-state isolation order, owner Mike Halle said.
"They feel like there is no way for them to meet the criteria for the reopening plan, and they think summer is canceled," Halle said.
Most of his guests are return visitors who book a weeklong family vacation a year in advance, Halle said. About 90 percent of his bookings are at risk.
Halle said he agreed with Mills' decision to extend a stay-at-home order until the end of May and would support a cautious approach through June. He and his staff were working on protocols to keep workers, guests and neighbors safe.
But extending a strict self-quarantine rule through July and August is going to hurt his business and his city, an iconic Maine summertime destination, Halle said.
"I think the governor just said Maine is in good shape - the only way to screw that up is to open it up to out-of-state people," he said. "Give us a little credit for being responsible business people and give us a chance to bring customers in safely."
'A BALANCE CAN BE ARRIVED AT'
A DECD spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the quarantine rule and guidance the department is developing for businesses.
Chip Gray, owner of the Harraseeket Inn in Freeport, said he's already taking care of out-of-state guests. Essential workers from New York and Massachusetts stayed at the hotel while working on municipal well projects and repairing power lines after a recent spring storm, he said.
The hotel has stepped up sanitation, giving rooms a deep clean after every guest leaves, practicing social distancing in the lobby and public areas, and doing everything it can to keep people safe.
"A balance can be arrived at allowing the out-of-state visitor with the correct safety protocols in place to protect the population and keep the economic fabric of Maine's society whole," Gray said.

No race this year 'It's really the only right decision,' race founder Joan Benoit Samuelson says of calling off one of Maine's premier summer events.

Texto completo: With the Tokyo Olympics postponed for a year and most major road races postponed or canceled, Joan Benoit Samuelson was hoping the 2020 TD Beach to Beacon 10K road race in Cape Elizabeth could be "one of the bright lights of the summer."
Instead, Maine's largest road race became the latest sporting event to be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced on Wednesday.
Founded by Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic women's marathon gold medalist, the race had been held annually since 1998 and has become one of Maine's premier events each summer. This year's race was scheduled for Aug. 1.
"It's really the only right decision," said Samuelson. "It was a gut-wrenching decision. But there are people enduring hardships beyond what you or I can comprehend and we needed to take that into consideration. This is the year we had to look at the larger community and say, 'This is what we need to do.'"
The announcement came a day after Gov. Janet Mills released her four-stage plan to reopen the state's economy. Even on July 31, the plan tentatively would prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people. More than 6,500 runners registered for this year's Beach to Beacon.
"It was difficult on an emotional level but it wasn't difficult on a rational level," said race president David Backer. "It was a decision we knew we had to make, as much as it pained all of us to make it. I think now more than ever people need these celebrations of life to buoy their spirits. We all view the Beach to Beacon as a celebration of fitness and life. It's a fun gathering and a celebration of life.
"The size of it made it inevitable, the decision to cancel it."
Backer said the $55 registration fee would be refunded to all those who registered. And all 2020 registrants will receive the opportunity for early entry into the 2021 race.
"We recognize when people registered in mid-March it was with the knowledge that the pandemic was spreading and there was at least some chance the race would not be held," he said. "But the fact that the race filled up as quickly as it did shows people were simply hopeful there would be a way for this event to happen and people would have a way to get together and celebrate fitness. We thought it was important to refund the fees."
Race officials also said that the 2020 race beneficiary, JMG, will remain the beneficiary for the 2021 race.
Samuelson and race director Dave McGillivray, also the race director of the Boston Marathon, said they considered postponing the race until the fall. But Samuelson said, "There were too many unknowns, too much uncertainty. We decided to put all our energy into next year."
"I think one of the difficulties with a postponement is, still, the uncertainty," said McGillivray. "You don't want to postpone something, then have to cancel it. Secondly, finding the right date becomes an issue. It's a summer event. You put it into the fall, or early winter if you went into November, then what does it actually become? You could tone it down to the bare basics ... but the consensus was, we want the race to be what everyone has built the race to be, and not anything less. Let's think of other ways to celebrate running at the time."
Many prominent road races have already been pushed into the fall, including the Boston Marathon, now scheduled for Sept. 14.
Samuelson said moving the race into the fall presented other issues, including finding a date that didn't to go head-to-head with any school or club events on a weekend or finding enough volunteers in the fall rather than the summer. "There were so many considerations," she said. "When you put everything on the table, the most prudent decision was to take it off the books this year and come back stronger than ever before in 2021."
Over the years, the race has grown considerably, from an inaugural field of 3,000 runners to well over 6,000. Last year's race had 6,413 finishers.
It has become one of the most prestigious 10Ks in the nation, drawing elite runners from across the globe and the U.S.
"Joanie has done an incredible job building it up," said runner Rob Gomez, who is also on the race's board of directors. "The decision to cancel the Beach to Beacon will be felt not only in Maine, but across the region and the country. But I think everyone will understand given the circumstances."
Gomez, 36, was involved in one of the race's most dramatic and memorable finishes in 2017, when he picked up the leader of the Maine men's division, Jesse Orach, who had collapsed within yards of the finish line, and pushed him across first.
"As any runner involved with Beach to Beacon, you want the race to go on," said Gomez. "But the safety of everyone involved, whether runners, spectators, volunteers or sponsors, means more than running a race. If you're not sure the race can be safe for everyone participating in it, it's impossible to hold it."
Larry Wold is one of the race's 103 legacy runners, those who have run the 6.2 miles every year. He is also the Maine president of TD Bank, the race's primary sponsor.
The decision to cancel, he said, is hard, especially for those runners looking to race in what is considered the unofficial Maine 10K championship. But looking at the bigger picture was much more important.
"You don't want to be unwise about it," he said. "You just don't. This race is surrounded by so much good. It's not just the good athletes who made this such a special event. In fact, the elite runners become bit players in it. Its impact on the larger community will be felt, not just on those who run."
And losing the race for a year, he said, may strengthen the bonds of the volunteers, sponsors and host families.
"As a sponsor, we've given so many people the opportunity to make a contribution to this race, either as a runner, spectator, sponsor," he said.
"This may provide an opportunity to give them another way to channel that good to something else for a year. And I think they will appreciate the race that much more a year from now, and in so many ways strengthen the race."
McGillivray said race officials are looking to find a way to celebrate the event even if it can't be run.
"We're going to spend the next few months figuring out what we can do to keep people connected and to support local charities," he said. "We're going to do something. It won't be a road race, but it will be something."

Texto completo: Regular exercise combats the double whammy of inactivity and isolation that can cause or worsen many physical and mental health problems.

Susan Henderson knows the value of regular exercise.
A retired nursing professor and South Portland city councilor, she’s had a gym membership for years. She’s aware of the cardiovascular, weight-control and other health benefits of working out at any age, especially for people over age 50. She and her late husband, Scott Hatch, used to go together.
But her gym has been closed during the coronavirus pandemic, so Henderson is making sure she gets out of the house once or twice each day to take her dog, Serenia, for a rigorous walk.
“Getting outdoors has always been a coping mechanism for me,” said Henderson, 78. “It normalizes my day, even in the best of times. But now it’s about moving my body and staying as healthy as I can during this difficult time.”
Many older Mainers are staying home to avoid contracting COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. And with good reason.
Older people and individuals with underlying health issues such as heart, lung or liver disease and diabetes, are considered especially vulnerable to the virus; 658 of 1,040 confirmed cases in Maine (63%) and all 51 deaths here have been among people age 50 and older.
Inactivity and isolation are a double whammy that can cause or worsen physical and mental health problems, including high blood pressure, arthritis, depression and anxiety. Conversely, even modest regular exercise can help reduce health complaints and improve a person’s ability to cope during a stress-inducing pandemic.
“Whether you do it indoors or outdoors, get your body moving,” said Marilyn Gugliucci, professor and director of geriatrics research at the University of New England’s medical school.
For people with mobility issues, Gugliucci recommended exercises that can be done sitting or standing with stationary support, such as a chair or railing. For others, she suggested workouts that can be done without risking injury at a time when seeking medical care can be challenging.
“Do what you can. Exercise with intention,” Gugliucci said. “If you’re sitting at home, start with knee lifts. Work from head to toe. Go through the full range of motion.”
A variety of fitness instruction videos and programs for in-home workouts is available on TV and online. Henderson took an online strength and balance class offered by her gym. Maine Public television airs yoga or stretch classes daily at 6:30 a.m.
During the pandemic, Hannah LeBlanc, a fitness specialist with UNE’s Exercise and Conditioning for Easier Living (U-ExCEL) program for older adults, has produced several free workout videos that are posted on YouTube and shared through the Maine Council on Aging’s COVID-19 information updates.
LeBlanc’s videos build on previous Balancing Act videos that also were produced for the U-ExCEL program and feature Gugliucci demonstrating the exercises.
LeBlanc demonstrates and explains the exercises in her videos, including “Strength and Balance,” which increases core, upper- and lower-body strength; “Sit and Fit,” which improves all-over strength and flexibility while sitting; and “Core Dynamics,” which targets abdominal muscles, back, hips and buttocks.
“Remember,” LeBlanc tells participants in one video, “listen to your body and only do what’s comfortable for you.”
LeBlanc usually leads a variety of fitness classes at Piper Shores, a retirement community in Scarborough. During the pandemic, the campus has been closed and all group activities have been canceled, leaving residents to find other ways to stay active.
Some are using LeBlanc’s videos, while others are joining her on daily walks around the tree-lined campus while staying at least 6 feet apart.
“Exercise is a key factor in living longer, moving with confidence and staying independent,” LeBlanc said. “It can reduce or delay many chronic health conditions and reduces the risk of falling, which can trigger a variety of other health problems. And it reduces stress, which is probably most important at a time like this.”
Judy Young is a Piper Shores resident who has joined LeBlanc on guided walkabouts, though she usually goes for a brisk walk at least once a day on her own. She’s a former physical education teacher and professor of kinesiology — the science of body movement — who spent her career promoting fitness.
“I know how to exercise, but I’m interested now more than during my career in the benefits for seniors,” said Young, 77. “In order to have a good quality of life as we get older, we have to be more attentive to our health.”
In addition to previously mentioned benefits, Young noted that exercise boosts the immune system, endurance and attitude, all of which would be especially helpful during the pandemic.
“It keeps you able to continue doing the things you love and support other people in your life,” Young said. “You’re taking care of yourself.”
For Susan Henderson, the South Portland city councilor, the previously perfunctory activity of walking her dog is also proving to have significant mental health benefits during the pandemic.
On a recent hike through one of South Portland’s wooded parks, Henderson recalled the Japanese concept of shinrin-yoku or “forest bathing,” which recognizes that being surrounded by trees can promote health and happiness.
“We passed a brook. We passed a pond. Every care left me,” Henderson said. “It was just wonderful.”

Texto completo: Another $42 million in grants has been allocated, bringing the total to nearly $188 million.

Maine hospitals and other health care providers will receive an additional $42 million in federal grants to bolster efforts to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, bringing the total emergency funds received to nearly $188 million.
U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King issued a joint statement Tuesday that Maine hospitals and other health care providers would receive an “immediate infusion” of $42 million. It is the second round of grant funding allocated through the $100 billion for U.S. medical providers included in the federal CARES Act, enacted on March 27.
The first round of funding for Maine health care providers totaled nearly $146 million.
“This funding is vital to protecting the health and safety of Mainers and will provide critical support to our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who are on the frontlines,” said Collins and King in the joint statement. “We will continue to ensure that all health care providers have the resources they need to continue to respond to this pandemic and treat patients.”
Across the state, nearly 100 health care providers will receive the funding, which will be used to reimburse providers for health care-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to the outbreak, and to ensure uninsured residents can get testing and treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.

We need clean air to stay healthy

Texto completo: In a time when the world is in an extreme health crisis, people are making the connection between air pollution and numbers of coronavirus deaths. Public health researchers have found that even a small increase in air particle pollution can increase the coronavirus death rate by as much as 15 percent.
This becomes very relevant for us in South Portland, one of Maine's most densely populated cities, carefully following safe distancing while surrounded by 120 polluting oil tanks. The idea of even the slightest increase in throughput from Global Partners - that is, the amount of bunker fuel and asphalt they process in their heated tanks - becomes most alarming.
It is very troubling that the president has grabbed the opportunity to create more chaos by allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to eviscerate restrictions on air pollution. But surely because of home rule the EPA does not have the last word when it comes to Maine. It is incomprehensible that at this time, Global Partners is seeking authorization to quadruple their annual throughput.
With neighbors dying and nursing staff risking their lives to brave this pandemic, surely we can look to our own Maine Department of Environmental Protection to do all it can to guarantee that air pollutants from the tanks will not be increased and that careful measures will be taken to keep us safe, such as vapor recovery units and fenceline monitoring, which, according to the EPA, can stop 95 percent of air contaminants.
Surely this is the time for us all to pull together and keep each other safe.

Gideon will be example of better leadership
I believe we are getting contradictory, mismanaged and even false information about COVID-19 from this administration. From being told it didn't exist, to being told the country could be past it by Easter, and by blaming others, we have been poorly served.
America is storing her dead in refrigerated produce trucks while they await burial in mass graves. We are a country that cannot even provide our medical heroes with adequate protective equipment, or its citizens with sufficient testing.
Now Donald Trump is considering "opening" America, piecemeal. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has politely demurred. Rather, Dr. Fauci has delineated the conditions he has utilized to control past epidemics - the need to be able to: test, identify, isolate and track contacts. And Dr. Fauci has been clear that we are not there yet.
Fortunately, we in Maine have far better leadership. Thanks to the work of Sara Gideon, Maine Democrats, Republicans and independents worked together to fund a million dollars for testing, and another $15 million to support health care workers assisting the elderly and children.
We need her in D.C. fighting for both the interests of Maine as well as the country. As speaker of Maine's House, she has a proven record of bringing people together and working across the aisle.
With Sara Gideon in D.C., I believe we could again state, "As Maine goes, so goes the nation." Join me in supporting her in the July 14 Democratic primary.

Out-of-state groups distort Collins' record
I recently saw perhaps one of the most distasteful and dishonest political ads of this campaign season, connecting Republican Sen. Susan Collins' support of the 2017 tax cuts, which helped thousands of Maine citizens and hundreds of Maine's small businesses, while at the same time linking that vote to the current COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Unbelievable!
The ad, paid for by Maine Momentum PAC, a dark money group supporting Sara Gideon, is yet another attempt by out-of-state millionaires like Chuck Schumer and billionaires like George Soros and Donald Sussman to deceive and distort Sen. Collins' record. She has always been there, supporting Maine people. She was the author and bipartisan architect of the current Paycheck Protection Program, which has already benefited more than 14,000 businesses and an estimated 180,000 employees here in Maine.
This same group has received three Pinocchios from The Washington Post's Fact Checker for lying and distorting the senator's bipartisan record and votes in the past. What's more disturbing is attempting to find out how much dark money they, and other groups like 16 Counties, have spent in support of Sara Gideon's campaign.
I, like many Maine voters, am tired of the false, misleading ads by out-of-state PACs attacking one of Maine's finest public servants, Sen. Susan Collins. You may disagree with her political positions, but nobody should ever question her loyalty and love of Maine and her people. Sen. Collins is from Maine and her roots run deep, unlike those of the people attacking her character.

Gideon will advocate for healthy environment
I'm writing to support Rep. and Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. Speaker Gideon has represented me in my local and state government for over a decade and she has never disappointed on her stance across sector and stakeholder interest.
Having recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, it's important to recognize that Speaker Gideon's record for the environment is stellar, graded 7/7 by Maine Conservation Voters in 2019.
She has forcefully advocated for environmental protections and public safety against pollution and a built environment, supporting energy conservation as well as renewable energy. Rep. Gideon has shown outstanding leadership, working across the aisle pulling legislation together for the good of the whole state.
I saw Rep. Gideon speak eloquently and forcefully against ignorance and small-mindedness in a memorable, crackling interaction in 2016 between her and our then governor, right here in Freeport. It was magic and powerful. It's that kind of fortitude and clarity that are required in Washington, and I will do all that I can to help Speaker Sara Gideon represent us there.

Governor's order will require face coverings in public settings

Texto completo: Starting Friday, everyone in Maine who enters a public place where physical distancing is difficult to maintain will be required to wear a cloth face mask or covering to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The new normal for going out into public is a key piece of Gov. Janet Mills' extended stay-at-home order, which will remain in effect until May 31. Her plan will allow the state's economy to open in phases, with the first phase set to start Friday.
Mills' executive order, which was published Wednesday, identifies public places or settings as indoor spaces that are accessible to the public and outdoor spaces as places where large crowds of people tend to gather. The order also strongly urges people to maintain social distancing of 6 feet in addition to wearing face coverings.
Mainers will have to wear face coverings in places such as grocery stores, retail stores, pharmacies and health care facilities. Under the order, the new rule also will apply to outdoor spaces such as playgrounds, congested parking lots, lines for take-out service, bus stops and waiting areas, as well as during transportation by taxis, Uber, Lyft, ride-sharing, ferries, buses and trains.
Mills has included exclusions to the rule that exempt children under the age of 2, a child in a child care setting, people that have trouble breathing, or someone who would be otherwise be unable to remove a mask on their own.
The executive order does not say how the face covering requirement will be enforced or whether there will be penalties for infractions. In an emailed response to questions about the face mask requirement, Lindsey Crete, Mills' press secretary, said: "We are pleased with the compliance of the previous orders, which has helped us flatten the curve on this virus, and we assume we will see the same degree of compliance with this order, given its public health purposes."
The Mills administration hasn't revealed the specific data it is using to determine that Maine has flattened the curve of the virus's progression.
The governor is encouraging Mainers to make their own cloth face coverings from common materials or to purchase them from a Maine-based company. The Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership has compiled a list of Maine companies that are producing face coverings. Mills' administration is sharing the list as a resource for residents.
"As our state begins to ease some restrictions as part of the plan to gradually and safely restart the economy, it is important for Maine people to also take individual precautions to prevent the spread of the virus," Mills said in a statement attached to her executive order. "Ultimately, this is about protecting our communities. By wearing a cloth face covering, you are taking an important step protecting others, and when others wear them, they are taking an important step in protecting you."
The Mills administration also announced Wednesday that it has entered into a partnership with a Westbrook-based company, American Roots, to purchase and provide two cloth face coverings for every state employee. The state will purchase 27,500 cloth face coverings. American Roots will begin producing 4,000 coverings per week effective May 14.
A significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 are considered asymptomatic, which means they have the disease, but are not exhibiting symptoms. That segment of the population can still transmit the virus to others before becoming sick. A face mask can prevent the spread of the virus from the mask wearer to others.
"Face coverings can help keep people with COVID-19 from spreading it to others," Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement. "Wearing a face covering when out in public can complement physical distancing as part of a strategy to limit the risk of exposure during a gradual reopening."

Portland and Brunswick in recent weeks have each adopted measures that require employees of grocery stores, banks, convenience stores and indoor, public serving locations to wear masks. Those municipalities did not extend their orders to the public.
In her order, Mills states that cloth face coverings are distinctly different from surgical or N-95 masks, which should be reserved for health care workers and first responders.
Ideally, a cloth face mask covers the nose and mouth and fits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, according to U.S. CDC guidelines. It can be secured with ties or ear loops and may include multiple layers of fabric that allow a person to breathe without restrictions. The mask can be laundered and machine dried without damaging its shape.
When removing a cloth face covering, people, should avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth before immediately washing their hands.
U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams described in a recent video how to fashion and wear a simple cloth face covering.

Funtown Splashtown won't open this summer
Funtown Splashtown USA, the amusement park in Saco, will not open this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Park owner Kevin Cormier made the decision Wednesday, News Center Maine (WCSH/WLBZ) reported. The decision was in response to state restrictions designed to halt the spread of COVID-19 that prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people through July and national restrictions on international travel that would limit the availability of temporary workers being hired through the J-1 visa program.
According to the park's website, Funtown has been in business every summer since 1960, when it began as a drive-in restaurant next to a miniature golf course.
Attempts to contact Cormier Wednesday night were not successful.

Ramblers Way clothing has closed city store
A Maine-based clothing company that specializes in organic wool clothing has closed its flagship store at 75 Market St. in Portland.
Ramblers Way, a line of clothing and stores owned by Tom Chappell and his family, has decided to direct its marketing efforts to online sales.
Chappell and his wife, Kate, who sold Tom's of Maine to Colgate Palmolive in 2006, said he created Ramblers Way more than 10 years ago to bring the manufacturing sustainable clothing to America. Tom's of Maine in Kennebunk sells natural oral and personal care products.
Since then, his family has opened and now closed four Ramblers Way stores in New Hampshire and Maine, with the Portland store being the last to shut down, Chappell said. Ramblers Way makes 100 percent organic Merino wool and Pima cotton clothes.
"We have had no luck with physical retail stores and are thus moving our marketing focus to web only," Chappell said in an email.
He said sales on the company's website are more than four times those from the store, a sales trend he attributes to a ramped up web marketing campaign. His son, Christopher Chappell manages the e-commerce division of the company while his daughter, Eliza Chappell, is Ramblers Way clothing designer.
Chappell said the Portland store closed in March, but he spent part of the day on Wednesday removing some of the store's fixtures and loading them into a truck.
FREEPORT
Town gives Bean tax break on expansion
A new agreement between the town of Freeport and L.L. Bean will give the company a nearly $10 million tax break as it moves forward with a $110 million expansion of its Freeport headquarters, while simultaneously generating roughly $25 million in new tax revenue for the town and securing plans to help clean up a polluted stream.
Tuesday, the town council established a new tax increment financing district to help offset L.L. Bean's future property tax costs over the next 30 years.
The agreement is "in every sense, a mutually beneficial partnership," Keith McBride, head of the Freeport Economic Development Corporation, told the council.
Tax increment financing (TIF) is a funding tool used by municipalities to pay for public projects.
In this case, the project is expected to generate more than $25 million in property tax revenue over the TIF period. Of that, roughly $8.4 million will go toward town projects, and $7.3 million to the general fund. About $9.6 million will be available for L.L. Bean.
In exchange for the tax incentive, L.L. Bean officials will help clean up Concord Gully Brook, which the Maine Department of Environmental Protection has categorized as an "urban impaired stream" for years.
Among other proposed benefits, L.L. Bean officials also granted the town an easement for the construction of a multi-use trail from West Street to Pine Street.
L.L. Bean, the town's biggest taxpayer, pays roughly $2.8 million per year in property taxes and the company's headquarters, warehouse and delivery center, retail stores and other facilities are worth almost $193 million.
Wiscasset
Airport gets $3 million for repaving runway
The Wiscasset Municipal airport received $3.2 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Airport Improvement Program, which will be used to repave the airport's only runway.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, announced the award Monday. Wiscasset is one of five Maine airports to receive the funding, but Wiscasset took over half of the total of $6,121,002 award from the improvement program.
The Portland International Jetport received the next largest award of $2.2 million to rehabilitate a taxiway. The Augusta State Airport was given $300,000 to update the airport's master plan, the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport received $190,406 to rehabilitate the airport apron and the Bethel Regional Airport received $75,000 to remove obstructions from the property.
Located about four miles south of downtown Wiscasset, the Wiscasset Airport is owned by the town and caters to mostly smaller, private planes used by recreational or business flyers.
ROCKLAND
Maine Lobster Festival canceled this summer
The Maine Lobster Festival, which celebrates the state's most beloved export, will not take place in 2020 because of fears about the coronavirus.
Organizers of the event said Tuesday they were "deeply disappointed" to have to shutter the event but ultimately determined the closure was unavoidable. The event draws thousands of people to coastal Rockland every summer.
Author David Foster Wallace featured the festival in a magazine article that later became the title essay in his nonfiction collection "Consider The Lobster." It's popular because of lobster dinners and events such as the Maine Sea Goddess Pageant.

Texto completo: Crystal Burke started experiencing symptoms on March 15, two days after returning from Boston. Her doctor declared her presumptive positive for COVID-19 and she was tested on March 18, in part because of her prior respiratory problems.
Burke's test was sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab in Atlanta and she was told to wait. She wasn't a health care worker and she wasn't elderly, so it might be a week or more. This was before Maine started processing its own tests.
As she waited, quarantined at home in the town of Hancock, her symptoms worsened. High fever. Fatigue. Trouble breathing. Her husband and three daughters, ages 3, 5 and 9, developed symptoms, too, but they were mild.
Nearly three weeks passed before her results came back. They were negative.
Burke didn't know what to make of them. She believes that because she was tested so early, because she uses a steroid inhaler and because her results sat for so long, maybe the test wasn't accurate.
"But I'd like to know because if I didn't have it, I'm at pretty high risk," she said.
Since the coronavirus outbreak began spreading in the United States in March, public health experts have sounded a familiar refrain: The number of confirmed cases represents the tip of the iceberg. But trying to measure the size of that iceberg is a daunting task.
For one, states don't have the ability to conduct widespread testing. Maine, like many states, has focused its testing on health care workers and people at high risk, such as those who live in long-term care facilities.
Many doctors have told patients who exhibit the symptoms of COVID-19 to just stay home. Ericka Dodge Katz of Brunswick went to the emergency department at Maine Medical Center on March 30 after she had trouble breathing. She had experienced symptoms for several days by then and her doctor said she was presumptive positive, even though she was never tested. She described the illness as "the scariest health experience in my life."
only 'part of the iceberg'
There also have been an unknown number silent carriers of the virus who don't show any symptoms and wouldn't even think to get tested. They are one of the biggest reasons for imposing strict stay-at-home measures - because asymptomatic people can spread the disease unknowingly and exponentially. Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told CNN on Tuesday that the reason the American economy is shutdown is because of inadequate testing.
Under better circumstances, states would add sentinel, or random, testing as a way to more accurately capture the virus' spread and quash future outbreaks.
And then there are cases like Burke's - potential false negatives. Some estimates put the false negative rate as high as 20 percent. That's why most experts have advised that even people who test negative should act as though they have the disease.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week that the state has begun tracking a new category of cases - probable cases - that will provide a more accurate (but still not complete) picture. Last Friday, just two of the state's 965 cases were probable.
"In the interest in thinking ahead, because we now have this category; there will be more cases ... more people who previously weren't counted," Shah said.
By Wednesday, 27 of the 1,056 cases were probable.
Shah explained last week that the state can identify probable cases through contact tracing. CDC investigators contact those who have tested positive and ask about people with whom they have come into contact. If a person's spouse develops symptoms consistent with COVID-19, their doctor might decide not to do a test, but the CDC can conclude that the person had the virus.
"In any outbreak situation," Shah said this week, "we're only seeing a part of the iceberg at any one time. We need to account for that part of the iceberg we might not see but we know is there."
using identical language
Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long said medical providers can report probable cases to Maine CDC but it has not been common. If it does happen, the CDC would conduct its own contact tracing.
Each state is now using the same language to determine probable cases, so there is consistency state to state. In simple terms, probable cases are people who are symptomatic with a known exposure to COVID-19 and no other likely diagnosis but have not been confirmed with a positive test.
The U.S. CDC began including probable cases and deaths in its data on April 14.
However, although the U.S. CDC recommends that states share probable cases, some states are not. Those that are have reported larger numbers. New York City last week revised its numbers to include probable cases and deaths. The numbers spiked dramatically, confirming what experts have been saying for a while. It also led to some conspiracy-minded accusations that states are padding their numbers.
Dr. Su-Anne M. Hammond, primary care medical director for Northern Light Mercy Hospital, said doctors there have been following the CDC's strict guidelines for testing, which means there are many patients who have the disease but have not been tested.
"A lot of people seemed to understand our testing limitations but there are some who really want answers," Hammond said. "What we tell them is: If I test you and it's positive, that's not going to change what we're going to tell you to do.' So we ask them to trust our clinical judgment."
Hammond said people with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are asked to stay home and isolate from family. Doctors can then monitor them closely with telehealth.
"There is really no way to estimate how many might be probable cases," Hammond said.
antibody testing crucial
For Katz, a probable case, and Burke, a possible one, both followed recommendations to self-quarantine to limit the chance of spreading the disease.
Burke said in an ideal world, she'd be approved for an antibody test, which allows testing people even after they have recovered.
Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said this week that Maine is exploring its options for adding antibody tests, but that the accuracy and reliability of such tests is not yet where it needs to be. Antibody tests do not currently meet the CDC definition for a confirmed case but would denote a probable case.
Hammond agreed that antibody testing will be crucial going forward, but said it's "not as close as people think."
"That's hard for people because instant gratification is a big part of our world," she said.
Burke has one other reason to be worried.
Her oldest daughter has Down syndrome. Although there is no evidence that people with Down syndrome are at greater risk if they contract COVID-19, they may be more at risk generally from infections, especially respiratory infections.
"She is the ray of sunshine that walks into the room," Burke said.
If she has indeed recovered, Burke said she'd be glad to offer her services. She works in biotech and has a background in veterinary care.
"If I did have it and I have some immunity, I'd be happy to go work in front line," she said. "But I need to know because I can't risk my family."

Texto completo: The outbreaks at Tyson Foods in Portland and the Hope House shelter in Bangor come two days before the Mills administration plans to begin relaxing restrictions on some businesses.
Report comes two days before Mills administration plans to relax some restrictions

State health officials reported one additional coronavirus death as well as new outbreaks in Portland and Bangor on Wednesday, highlighting the challenges facing the Mills administration as it prepares to relax some restrictions on businesses this week.
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreaks included eight cases at the Tyson Foods meat processing plant in Portland and 20 cases at Bangor’s Hope House Health and Living Center, which includes a homeless shelter. The 20 Hope House cases were not included in the 1,056 confirmed cases the agency reported earlier Wednesday in its daily coronavirus update.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said his agency is working with the facilities to help test everyone at Hope House and the Tyson Foods plant.
At Tyson Foods, which is the largest outbreak in Maine to date outside of a health care or long-term care business, the company is discussing potentially idling the plant but still having employees come in for testing, Shah said. He described those discussions as “very collaborative.”
“If we close down the facility and no employees are showing up, it makes it harder to do the first goal, which is to test everybody,” Shah said at an afternoon news briefing. “So there is a bit of a trade-off there. So we are working with the facility in order to find a way to idle the plant so that workers can still show up, maybe not do the job that they would previously do but something else, and still have an opportunity to discharge our first goal, which is to get everyone tested.”
Earlier Wednesday, the Maine CDC released new figures showing a decline in active cases as the number of people recovering from the COVID-19 disease outpaced new, confirmed infections.
The agency reported 16 additional confirmed COVID-19 cases, raising the statewide total to 1,056, and said a woman in her 70s from Cumberland County was the 52nd resident to die from the disease.
The confirmed cases only show a portion of COVID-19’s presence in Maine because of limited testing. But the figures released earlier Wednesday — before the 20 Hope House cases were reported — suggested that the virus curve may be flattening.
The number of active COVID-19 cases — calculated by deducting the 52 deaths and 615 recovered individuals from total cases to date — fell below 400 on Wednesday for the first time since April 12. Maine CDC reported 389 active cases as of early Wednesday morning. That’s a decline from the peak of 446 active cases on April 17.
Thirty-two people were hospitalized, down one from Tuesday, while the number of patients in critical care beds or connected to respiratory ventilators held steady at 17 and seven, respectively. Roughly one quarter of the total cases — 247 individuals — are among health care workers.
Maine had a total of 330 critical care beds in its hospitals Wednesday, of which 171 were available, and a total of 314 ventilators, of which 299 were available. In addition, there were 397 alternative ventilators available.
Such data will be key to the timing of Gov. Janet Mills’ plan to begin a phased reopening of Maine’s partially shuttered economy. Many sectors of Maine’s tourism industry will likely remain largely shut down, at least to out-of-state visitors, well into the summer, however.
On Wednesday evening, Mills’ office released the executive order formally extending Maine’s “stay-at-home” order through May 31 while allowing residents to travel outside of their homes to the expanded list of businesses. The order also requires Mainers to wear cloth face coverings — consistent with recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — in public spaces where physical distancing is not possible.
The administration defined those areas as: grocery stores, retail stores, pharmacies and health care facilities; outdoor spaces such as playgrounds, busy parking lots and other areas such as lines for take-out service; and public transportation including buses, ferries, trains, taxis, ride-sharing services or semi-enclosed transit stop or waiting areas.
“As our state begins to ease some restrictions as part of the plan to gradually and safely restart the economy, it is important for Maine people to also take individual precautions to prevent the spread of the virus,” Mills said in a statement. “Ultimately, this is about protecting our communities. By wearing a cloth face covering, you are taking an important step in protecting others, and when others wear them, they are taking an important step in protecting you.”
Mills also said the gradual reopening of the economy — far too gradual, for some critics — is because “Maine appears to be flattening the curve against this pandemic.”
But while the active case numbers appear to be trending downward, Maine CDC continues to track several deadly outbreaks at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.
To date, the agency has documented 151 cases among residents of long-term or congregate care facilities along with 81 staff members. The 29 deaths among long-term care facility residents comprise more than half of all deaths in Maine.
The largest outbreaks have occurred at the Augusta Center for Health and Rehabilitation, the Maine Veterans’ Home in Scarborough and the Tall Pines nursing home in Belfast. Smaller outbreaks are being tracked at Falmouth By the Sea, The Cedars in Portland and Edgewood in Farmington.

Beach to Beacon called off

Texto completo: 'It's really the only right decision,' race founder Joan Benoit Samuelson says of calling off one of Maine's premier summer events.
With the Tokyo Olympics postponed for a year and most major road races postponed or canceled, Joan Benoit Samuelson was hoping the 2020 TD Beach to Beacon 10K road race in Cape Elizabeth could be “one of the bright lights of the summer.”
Instead, Maine’s largest road race became the latest sporting event to be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced on Wednesday.
Founded by Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic women’s marathon gold medalist, the race had been held annually since 1998 and has become one of Maine’s premier events each summer. This year’s race was scheduled for Aug. 1.
“It’s really the only right decision,” said Samuelson. “It was a gut-wrenching decision. But there are people enduring hardships beyond what you or I can comprehend and we needed to take that into consideration. This is the year we had to look at the larger community and say, ‘This is what we need to do.’”
The announcement came a day after Gov. Janet Mills released her four-stage plan to reopen the state’s economy. Even on July 31, the plan tentatively would prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people. More than 6,500 runners registered for this year’s Beach to Beacon.
“It was difficult on an emotional level but it wasn’t difficult on a rational level,” said race president David Backer. “It was a decision we knew we had to make, as much as it pained all of us to make it. I think now more than ever people need these celebrations of life to buoy their spirits. We all view the Beach to Beacon as a celebration of fitness and life. It’s a fun gathering and a celebration of life.
“The size of it made it inevitable, the decision to cancel it.”
Backer said the $55 registration fee would be refunded to all those who registered. And all 2020 registrants will receive the opportunity for early entry into the 2021 race.
“We recognize when people registered in mid-March it was with the knowledge that the pandemic was spreading and there was at least some chance the race would not be held,” he said. “But the fact that the race filled up as quickly as it did shows people were simply hopeful there would be a way for this event to happen and people would have a way to get together and celebrate fitness. We thought it was important to refund the fees.”
Race officials also said that the 2020 race beneficiary, JMG, will remain the beneficiary for the 2021 race.
Samuelson and race director Dave McGillivray, also the race director of the Boston Marathon, said they considered postponing the race until the fall. But Samuelson said, “There were too many unknowns, too much uncertainty. We decided to put all our energy into next year.”
“I think one of the difficulties with a postponement is, still, the uncertainty,” said McGillivray. “You don’t want to postpone something, then have to cancel it. Secondly, finding the right date becomes an issue. It’s a summer event. You put it into the fall, or early winter if you went into November, then what does it actually become? You could tone it down to the bare basics … but the consensus was, we want the race to be what everyone has built the race to be, and not anything less. Let’s think of other ways to celebrate running at the time.”
Many prominent road races have already been pushed into the fall, including the Boston Marathon, now scheduled for Sept. 14.
Samuelson said moving the race into the fall presented other issues including finding a date that didn’t to go head-to-head with any school or club events on a weekend or finding enough volunteers in the fall rather than the summer. “There were so many considerations,” she said. “When you put everything on the table, the most prudent decision was to take it off the books this year and come back stronger than ever before in 2021.”
Over the years, the race has grown considerably, from an inaugural field of 3,000 runners to well over 6,000. Last year’s race had 6,413 finishers.
It has become one of the most prestigious 10Ks in the nation, drawing elite runners from across the globe and the U.S.
“Joanie has done an incredible job building it up,” said runner Rob Gomez, who is also on the race’s board of directors. “The decision to cancel the Beach to Beacon will be felt not only in Maine, but across the region and the country. But I think everyone will understand given the circumstances.”
Gomez, 36, was involved in one of the race’s most dramatic and memorable finishes in 2017, when he picked up leader Jesse Orach, who had collapsed within yards of the finish line, and pushed him across first.
“As any runner involved with Beach to Beacon, you want the race to go on,” said Gomez. “But the safety of everyone involved, whether runners, spectators, volunteers or sponsors, means more than running a race. If you’re not sure the race can be safe for everyone participating in it, it’s impossible to hold it.”
Larry Wold is one of the race’s 103 legacy runners, those who have run the 6.2 miles every year. He is also the Maine president of TD Bank, the race’s primary sponsor.
The decision to cancel, he said, is hard, especially for those runners looking to race in what is considered the unofficial Maine 10K championship. But looking at the bigger picture was much more important.
“You don’t want to be unwise about it,” he said. “You just don’t. This race is surrounded by so much good. It’s not just the good athletes who made this such a special event. In fact, the elite runners become bit players in it. Its impact on the larger community will be felt, not just on those who run.”
And losing the race for a year, he said, may strengthen the bonds of the volunteers, sponsors and host families.
“As a sponsor, we’ve given so many people the opportunity to make a contribution to this race, either as a runner, spectator, sponsor,” he said. “This may provide an opportunity to give them another way to channel that good to something else for a year. And I think they will appreciate the race that much more a year from now, and in so many ways strengthen the race.”
McGillivray said race officials are looking to find a way to celebrate the event even if it can’t be run.
“We’re going to spend the next few months figuring out what we can do to keep people connected and to support local charities,” he said. “We’re going to do something. It won’t be a road race, but it will be something.”

Texto completo: This is part of an occasional series answering readers' questions about Maine.
Q: Why are restaurants scheduled to open June 1 and bars July 1, and what if a business is both?
A: As with so many other questions triggered by the rollout this week of the state's reopening plan, we only have a partial answer right now.
The state is still figuring out many of the details of its complex plan, and this is a perfect example.
First, Gov. Janet Mills explained generally that restaurants will be allowed to open first because they can more easily keep customers separated from each other by limiting how many people they serve and spreading out the tables. Bars can limit the number of people allowed in, but it's not as simple to plant them 6 or 10 feet apart.
But, what about a business that is both things, like a pub or a restaurant that becomes a music club?
State officials are still trying to answer that one and find a way to delineate what is a restaurant and what is a bar, Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Heather Johnson said Wednesday.
"Certainly there is a lot of work to be done there on the individual specific components," she said.
Q: Will the 14-day tourist quarantine really stay in effect all summer, or will it be lifted sooner as some people are saying?
A: Few elements of the plan are raising as many questions as the 14-day quarantine for people coming from out-of-state. That is largely because a huge portion of Maine's economy relies on those visitors coming each summer, although the fear that they could bring the virus with them is also behind some of the questions.
Under the plan the governor unveiled Tuesday, the existing mandate of a 14-day quarantine for people entering the state will stay in place through August.
However, state officials made clear both Tuesday and Wednesday that the time frame may change and that the state and the tourism industry are looking for other less disruptive ways to prevent tourists from bringing the virus here with them. State officials have said they hope, but cannot promise, that the 14-day quarantine rule can be lifted earlier in the tourist season.
"The quarantine is what's available to us today," Johnson said. "We're working on the science to find different solutions."
"Our goal is to come up with more targeted, refined approach," said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
State officials have not said what scientific breakthroughs might replace the quarantine mandate, although the availability of widespread testing for the illness and the antibodies might be one possible way to reduce the risks.
Of course, it is important to remember that state officials have warned that reopening phases also could be delayed if the virus spreads in Maine or if the state doesn't adequately ramp up its capacity for testing and contact tracing. Continued widespread outbreaks in states such as Massachusetts and New York could also make it difficult for Maine to relax the quarantine mandate.
Q: How will the state enforce the 14-day quarantine?
A: Enforcement is already happening at the local level in communities that have seen an influx of out-of-state visitors.
Police in Wells, for example, have said they routinely talk to people who are out for a walk or a drive and remind people from away that they have to return to their vacation homes and stay there for the full 14 days, except for grocery shopping and other essential services.
Ultimately, violating any part of the state's stay-at-home order can be prosecuted as a misdemeanor, with the possibility of fines and jail time. That is considered an extreme measure, however, and most enforcement will start in the form of education, state and local officials say.
Q: What if a business that is allowed to open can't meet all the safety requirements because it can't get equipment like hand sanitizer?
A: "We acknowledge that's a challenge," Shah said Wednesday.
The state is trying to avoid setting up a competition between the medical industry and other businesses for protective equipment and supplies, so the checklists being prepared will likely have some alternatives, such as face coverings rather than medical-grade masks.
But, Shah said, businesses won't be ready to open if they don't meet the state's guidelines. "A business that's not able to satisfy each and every one of the criteria on the checklist should think twice about whether now is the right time to open," he said.
Q: If a business can show that it can operate safely, can it reopen sooner?
A: "Absolutely," said Johnson, the DECD commissioner. "We encourage people to reach out and work with us."

Texto completo: Catholic churches in Maine will begin holding drive-in Masses in the coming weeks, a move allowed under Gov. Janet Mills' phased plan to reopen businesses and churches closed because of the coronavirus.
The first phase of Mills' reopening plan takes effect on Friday and allows some businesses and outdoor activities to reopen, including drive-in movie theaters and "limited drive-in, stay-in-your-vehicle religious services," according to the governor's plan.
The Diocese of Portland on Wednesday announced that Bishop Robert Deeley is permitting the celebration of public Masses in the parking lots of Catholic churches. There will be "strict protocols in place for the protection, safety and health of all participants," according to the diocese. The first drive-in Masses are scheduled to be held in Auburn and Gorham starting May 9.
But other churches and houses of worship in Maine may hold off on drive-in services until more guidance is provided, or choose to focus instead on continuing online services, according to Rev. Jane Field, executive director of the Maine Council of Churches. She said there is "deep concern" from Maine Council of Churches leaders about bringing people together in a parking lot, where it could be tempting for some people to get out of their cars to visit with friends.
"It would need to be carefully thought out and carefully planned for," Field said of drive-in services. "It opens up a host of challenges to keep people safe."
The Maine Council of Churches plans to release an open letter to Gov. Janet Mills later this week seeking guidance from state health officials in adapting a three-phase model for returning to church based on a plan released by the Wisconsin Council of Churches.
The first drive-in Catholic Masses will be held starting May 9 and 10 in Gorham and Auburn, and the diocese has set up protocols to prevent people from coming too close to each other.
St. Anne Church in Gorham will hold Mass at 5:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:30 a.m. Sunday. The priest will lead Mass from the second story deck of the rectory. Saint Dominic Academy in Auburn will have its Mass at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
The times and locations for other drive-in Masses will be posted on the diocese website and Facebook page as they are scheduled.
During drive-in Catholic Masses, all parishioners must remain in their cars at all times and only people who live in the same household should be in the same vehicle. Cars must have one empty parking space between them in the parking lot and churches will not be open for restroom use.
Deeley announced that social distancing must be maintained by those who minister at drive-in Masses, including celebrants, cantors and lectors.
Holy Communion will not be distributed until everyone's safety can be assured, according to the diocese. Deeley has invited parishioners to instead participate in an Act of Spiritual Communion during Masses.
"This decision to expand the ways in which we gather for worship reflects that Catholics have a deep desire to gather as a faith community, which is essential to our identity as Christians. But I also know that many Catholics, here in Maine, across the nation, and around our world, feel the profound loss of not being able to receive Holy Communion," Deeley said in a statement.
"While it is a great sacrifice not to share in this sign of our unity, it is also a tremendous act of love and charity towards one another, especially the most vulnerable among us. We continue to look forward to a time when it will be possible safely to receive Holy Communion."
Catholic churches will continue to live-stream services as they have done since March. Parishes will also continue to have drive-through confessions, drive-in adoration and use social media for other programs.

Texto completo: John McDonald, who has hosted a weekend talk show on WGAN for 25 years, said he's been fired from the Portland radio station.
McDonald, 75, said he was not given a reason for his dismissal Friday by Bob Adams, president of WGAN's parent company, Portland Radio Group. McDonald said he had been allowed to take time off from the show over the last few weeks, partly because of his concerns about coming into the station during the current health crisis.
But in a meeting at the station Friday, he said, he was told by Adams his "hiatus" from the show would become permanent. Adams did not return emails and phone calls asking to confirm and provide a reason for McDonald's release.
"I had been thinking about taking a hiatus because of what's going on (with coronavirus), but I really did want to come back at some point," said McDonald. He said WGAN has not announced his departure on the air, so some of his listeners have emailed him to find out what happened and if he would be back.
McDonald is the second longtime host at WGAN to be fired in the past month or so. Ken Altshuler, who was co-host of WGAN's weekday morning news and talk show, was fired on March 27 after some 18 years. Altshuler, 67, had been the left-leaning counterpoint to co-host Matt Gagnon, CEO of the Maine Policy Institute, a conservative think tank. Altshuler said he was told his dismissal was part of "some financial restructuring" at the AM station.
McDonald hosted the "John McDonald Show" on Saturday and Sunday mornings from 6 to 10 a.m. McDonald discussed a wide variety of news, politics and lifestyle issues, had guests, and took phone calls. McDonald is a humorist and storyteller who makes frequent speaking appearances and has written for newspapers. He's also written six books, including "A Moose and a Lobster Walk into a Bar ..." and "Down the Road a Piece: A Storyteller's Guide to Maine."

Texto completo: More than ever, we all could use a good laugh.
Luckily, Maine comics are willing to help. The pandemic has prompted several Maine comedians to take their talents into the virtual world, with YouTube videos or series, daily Facebook updates and even a live Instagram talk show. Though nothing replaces a live audience, comics say, they can still do what they love while giving us all a smile once in a while. At least until live comedy gigs start happening again, and we can all laugh and smile together.
"What we are doing now is OK as a temporary fix for comedy. But I personally want to see smiling faces in person and human reactions in real time," said comedian Karen Morgan, who lives in Cumberland.
Here's what some Maine comics are doing to keep the laughs coming.
DAY BY DAY
Bob Marley is letting people share his takes on the weirdness of the current pandemic with his daily "Crona Watch 2020" on his Facebook page. Marley would normally be pretty busy right now, performing dates around the state and country. His daily updates consist of Marley telling us, in his Maine accent, about the latest events of his life in isolation. In one, he talks about how he would create social distancing at his comedy shows in the future, by spacing La-Z-Boy recliners some 10 feet apart and building toilets with bidets right into them. In another, he's dressed in a full face mask and gloves - looking exactly like every robber's composite sketch ever drawn - about to do a little banking. In another, he worries that he's wasted his quarantine time, and should have been lifting weights in his basement to get "ripped, like Brad Pitt or somethin'."
HERE'S KEITH
Keith Hebert has used his hiatus from live shows to work on his own web series, the "The Keith Hebert Show," on Instagram and YouTube. He plays a fictionalized version of himself talking about his character's life during the pandemic. The episodes are a few minutes long and have sort of a surreal feel; for some, he uses a green screen to make it seem like he's on a cruise ship, on a farm or in Europe. Sometimes he talks about various problems, like his fear of the dark or sleep walking or dealing with isolation. He says at one point he might be losing his grasp on reality, then is confronted by his imaginary evil twin, Bad Boy Keith. His evil twin talks about his mom being an evil homemaker, doing the groceries and putting away the perishables only after they've all expired.
FULL HOUSE
Morgan says she's still writing at home, but not jokes about the pandemic. She said that as always, a lot of her humor comes from family life. Right now, she's home with three college students, a high school senior, a husband and an "incontinent dog." A couple videos she put up recently on her YouTube channel were the result of her cleaning out the attic with her son and finding old 1980s workout videos, including some Jane Fonda tapes, which Morgan tries to follow. She also recently did a live-streamed Zoom show called "The Best Medicine" with other comedians around the country, talking about isolation. It can also be found on YouTube. She talked about getting stared at because she buys 1,000 frozen pizzas on her grocery runs. "I want to wear a sign that says I have four kids at my house."
LUNCH BREAK
Comics Rachel Gendron and Anders J. Nielsen, members of the Portland Comedy Co-Op who perform as a duo called Hard Seltzah, have created a weekly talk show on Instagram called Working Lunch. It happens live on Wednesdays on the Hard Seltzah Instagram page at 12:15 p.m. for about 20 to 25 minutes, then stays up for 24 hours. They started a few weeks ago, having other comedians call in, and now have expanded it to calling friends and other people they know. One recent guest was a friend from New York City talking about what it's like to isolate in a closet-sized apartment. Gendron has also set up an Instagram page to showcase her parents and what they're doing, which she calls a "live-ongoing comedy sketch."
STRAINGER THINGS
Comic Ian Stuart has taken this time in isolation to work on his web series about the world of medical marijuana. It's called "The Strainger," referring to the various strains of marijuana, and can be found on his YouTube channel. Stuart says he writes 20 to 25 jokes for each episode, and picks the best 10 to 15, so it helps him stay in joke-writing practice. In a recent episode, he describes the aroma of one marijuana strain by saying, "it smells like a very expensive salad your fiance would order at a steak house to prove the point that she's a vegetarian." Describing another strain he says it shines "like a Twix rapper in a landfill next to a public school."

Texto completo: The state agency overseeing affordable housing and emergency shelters has reserved more than 100 hotel rooms to address the threat coronavirus poses to homeless people.
A MaineHousing spokeswoman told the Press Herald on Tuesday that the agency rented a total of 115 rooms at three hotels to isolate and create social distancing for people struggling with homelessness. But only a handful of people with COVID-19 were staying at hotels in Portland and Bangor, and it wasn't clear how many were at a hotel in Knox County.
The news comes as the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced an outbreak at a Bangor homeless shelter, which now has 20 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, including 16 new cases Wednesday.
Denise Lord, senior director of communications and planning, said hotels in Portland and Bangor would be used to isolate individuals who have either tested positive for COVID-19 or are awaiting test results. Lord refused to name the hotels - even though the rooms are funded by tax dollars - saying the rooms are only available upon referral.
An additional 15 rooms in Warren are available for people staying at a shelter in Rockland that is operated by the Knox County Homeless Coalition, Lord said, because the facility is too small to meet social distancing guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The U.S. CDC recommends that sleeping mats and cots be spaced at least 6 feet apart.
"We're trying to locate hotels strategically across Maine to provide backup housing in case there's an outbreak or a surge ... among the homeless population," Lord said.
Congregate care facilities, like homeless shelters, are more susceptible to outbreaks because people sleep so close to each other. And many clients have underlying health conditions that could cause more severe symptoms and poorer outcomes.
According to the most recent survey of homelessness in Maine, 1,215 people were homeless statewide on Jan. 22, 2019, with 1,120 people finding shelter at a hotel/motel, emergency shelter or other temporary accommodation.
Until Wednesday, shelter providers have been able to avoid the types of outbreaks occurring at nursing homes and long-term care facilities that have at least three cases.
Maine CDC director Dr. Nirav Shah announced a new outbreak at the Hope House Health and Living Center, a homeless shelter in Bangor. Shah said universal testing was conducted this week after four people tested positive. That resulted in an additional 16 cases.
Lord said the hotels were selected through a competitive bidding process. Forty rooms were secured in Portland, 60 in Bangor and 15 in Warren, she said. The room rates range from $55 a night to $96 a night, because some hotels provide meals, regular housekeeping and deep cleaning services.
All told, Lord said, the state is paying $7,950 a day to keep the rooms available. She said other communities in the United States hope to access federal grants to pay for hotel rooms used by homeless people, and Maine wants to do the same.
In Portland, the only Maine municipality operating a low-barrier shelter, chronic overcrowding at the city's family and Oxford Street shelter for single adults was relieved by a mixture of hotel rooms and opening new facilities.
Sixteen homeless families were moved to hotel rooms, so most of the family shelter space could be used to isolate and quarantine people awaiting test results or who have tested positive for COVID-19. The Portland Exposition Building was opened for people who may have come into contact with someone who tested positive.
Preble Street, a nonprofit social service agency in Portland, worked with the state to open a temporary wellness center at the University of Southern Maine's Sullivan Gym for those who don't have the virus. That facility can serve as many as 50 people.
Those measures have dropped the population at the Oxford Street Shelter, which routinely surpassed its 154-person capacity, to fewer than 75 people, a number that allows the city to meet the social-distancing requirement, according to the city.
Jessica Grondin, a City Hall spokesperson, said the city continues to use its family shelter as an isolation area and quarantine space. The city will use those hotels only if its family shelter exceeds capacity, she said.
Grondin said 41 men were at the Expo, 53 people were at Oxford Street, 16 families were at the family shelter and another 16 families were in hotels. One person was in isolation and recovering from COVID-19.
Lord said additional wellness centers have been set up in Lewiston and Presque Isle.
"We have 125 people in wellness shelters throughout the state," Lord said. "That was our first priority, to reduce the likelihood of transmission through social distancing."
If all goes well, state officials hope not to have to use the hotel rooms. Lord said Tuesday that one person, referred by Preble Street, was staying at a hotel in Portland, while two or three were staying in Bangor.
But all of that suddenly changed, at least in Bangor. Lord said she expects infected individuals from Hope House would stay in hotel rooms.
"This situation illustrates exactly why it is so very important to have these rooms ready," Lord said.

Texto completo: I've still been listening to plenty of local music and streaming live performances by Maine acts in this time of isolation, but I'm also enjoying taking deeper dives into some of my lifelong favorite musicians by watching documentaries about them. It's been a fun adventure, using a Roku box as a metal detector in search of content gold that's come in the form of specials about artists like David Bowie, U2 and The Smiths.
I hit the jackpot recently with YouTube. I wasn't searching for it, but while watching something else, a documentary about British artist Kate Bush was recommended to me. I realize these suggestions are based on search history and algorithms, but just the same, my eyes lit up like a box of sparklers, and for the next hour, I was transfixed by archival footage I had never seen before, not to mention interviews with some of my idols, like Tori Amos and St. Vincent, talking about Bush's music.
Bush is on my top 10 list of all-time favorite artists, right up there with David Bowie. What has always drawn me to her music, which I discovered late in high school, is how striking, vibrant, mesmerizing, adventurous, emotional, fearless and lyrically lush it is.
"The Kate Bush Story" was made by the BBC and released in 2014. Whether you're a hardcore fan or a casual one, I guarantee you'll learn a ton and will have a much better understanding of why she is so revered and why her music has impacted and influenced so many people, including a local musician, which I'll get to in a bit.
Her debut album, "The Kick Inside," was released in 1978 when she was 19 years old. The song "Wuthering Heights," based on Emily BrontÃ«'s novel, went all the way to No. 1 on the U.K. singles chart and stayed there for four weeks.
In the documentary, writer Neil Gaiman said he "had never heard anything like it before. It was like banshee music, this absolute other-worldly voice singing about a book." No one sounds quite like Bush whose soprano voice comes from another planet and can go places few others can.
St. Vincent also weighed in on the song: "There aren't that many amazing pop songs that have two or three key changes in them. It's so brilliant, it's so memorable."
All told, Bush has released 10 studio albums, a triple live album and a couple of compilations. Her only live performance in the United States was in December of 1978 when she performed two songs on "Saturday Night Live." In 1979, Bush toured around Europe for six weeks, and that was her only tour until a 22-night run of shows at London's Hammersmith Apollo in 2014. I still regret not trying harder to get tickets to one of these shows, but then again, they sold out in 15 minutes.
In 2016, a triple live album called "Before the Dawn" was released, and it's all from those 2014 shows. It's also, hands down, the most moving live album I've ever heard.
Elton John was also featured in "The Kate Bush Story." He described her songs as not being normal. "She's just who she is, she's a mystery, she's the most beautiful mystery." Bush was a guest at John's 2005 civil partnership, and he described how there were 600 guests in attendance, and they all wanted to meet her.
Tori Amos is also on top 10 list of favorite artists, and she, too, was part of "The Kate Bush Story." Amos spoke about the first time she heard the song "Running Up That Hill" on the radio. It's a single from 1985's "Hounds of Love" album, and one of Bush's most popular songs. "I had to pull over and listen to it because I had never heard anything like it."
Local musician Sara Hallie Richardson, who I've long thought is cut from some of the same experimental and imaginative cloth as Bush, covered "Running Up that Hill" during her 2012 "Restless" album release show at One Longfellow Square. I couldn't make it to the show but am thankful that the clip is on YouTube, and I've watched it dozens of times over the years.
I reached out to Richardson and asked her about her decision to play the song. She told me that, back in 2012, she went through a particularly challenging and dark stretch, and the song became her anthem. "I was unemployed for three months, during which I learned this song, and my band and I performed it at my release party." They nailed it; just watch the clip. Richardson also said that, like many of her musical role models, Bush is forward-thinking, and her sound is all her own, never looking to imitate or blend into any genre. "She's a storyteller, a melodic acrobat and a woman who goes at her own pace - that's exactly the artist that I strive to be."
There's one other Maine connection I can make about the music of Kate Bush. Her 1982 album "The Dreaming" includes the song "Get Out of My House." This wasn't in the documentary, but I found multiple references online saying that the song was inspired by Stephen King's novel "The Shining." Also, the lyrics make it pretty clear.
So I run into the hall
(lock it)
Into the corridor
(lock it)
There's a door in the house
(slamming)
I hear the lift descending
(slamming)
I hear it hit the landing
(slamming)

Lewiston sees CMP project as fiscal lifesaver With tax revenues likely to fall because of the coronavirus, the transmission line project could bring the city at least $7 million property taxes.

Texto completo: LEWISTON -- With municipal revenue likely to fall because of the coronavirus pandemic, some city officials are hoping the controversial $1 billion New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line project will pour millions of new tax dollars into the city's coffers.
The extra property tax money from a new substation "would be a lifesaver for the city of Lewiston," Mayor Mark Cayer told members of a poverty awareness committee Wednesday.
He called the $7 million or more of additional revenue "a game changer for our community" because it would provide cash to address key social issues while allowing Lewiston to reduce the burden on residents he said are overtaxed today.
Lewiston Tax Assessor Bill Healey figured Central Maine Power's $350 million worth of improvements in the city would bring in more than $7 million in the first year. The Maine Center for Business and Economic Research estimated it might reach $8.4 million annually.
In short, the city would likely see at least 10 percent more revenue because of the new substation and related electrical infrastructure improvements.
City officials have estimated Lewiston might see a decrease in revenue of $1.6 million in the next fiscal year because of the pandemic. Even so, they anticipate a small decrease in the tax rate for the first time since 2008.
Thorn Dickinson, the chief executive officer and president of NECEC Transmission LLC, said in a prepared statement that "Lewiston in particular will enjoy millions of dollars of increased tax revenue, which is critical as we experience negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."
The 145-mile transmission line would carry hydroelectric power generated by dams in Quebec to a substation in Lewiston, where it would be fed into the regional grid and sent to Massachusetts.
A new converter station on Merrill Road would transform the direct current sent from dams in Quebec into the alternating current. The converter station would be tied through a new 1.6-mile transmission line to the existing Larrabee Road substation, which would be upgraded to handle more of the stepped-down voltage flowing in from the Merrill Road site.
Opponents of the project say it would carve up Maine's vast forest, create unsightly towers and bolster Hydropower Quebec's destruction of crucial environmental resources north of the St. Lawrence River.
The opposition group No CMP Corridor delivered about 82,500 signatures to the Maine Secretary of State's Office in February in support of a voter referendum seeking to stop the project. If approved by voters, the referendum is intended force the Maine Public Utilities Commission to reverse its May 2019 decision that the corridor project is in the interests of the state, thus halting any construction on the project.
The company that wants to build the corridor argues the project would help stem climate change by saving 3 million metric tons of carbon annually, the equivalent of taking 700,000 vehicles off the road each year for decades to come.
It aims to have the project done by December 2022.

Maine too slow on unemployment claims The state's goal should be getting cash out the door as quickly as possible.

Texto completo: The state's unemployment compensation system is overwhelmed as a record number of Mainers claim benefits as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.
But as staggering as the numbers are - more than 100,000 claims since mid-March - there is a statistic that is even more troubling. Only about a quarter of Maine workers have jobs that make them eligible for unemployment insurance if they get laid off through no fault of their own. Most workers are expected to fall back on their own savings to get them through tough financial times.
So it's good news that the state Department of Labor will finally be able to start taking applications from farmers, fishermen, freelancers and other self-employed people, including those who work in the as-needed "gig economy." Twenty other states have beaten Maine to the punch and are delivering the new benefits created by Congress as part of the $2 trillion stimulus bill. Overwhelmed processing traditional unemployment claims, Maine was slow to get the new program started, but the benefits are retroactive, so many of these workers will get much-needed support to meet their obligations and keep their heads above water.
PAST DELAYS
Hopefully, this new program will run smoother than the traditional unemployment system, which has struggled to keep up with the crush of new claims.
At a time when we desperately needed the state to get the money out the door as quickly as possible, about a third of people seeking benefits fell through trapdoors in the application process, requiring them to go months without a paycheck while they wait for fact-finding interviews. Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said last week that thousands of those claims have been expedited to relieve the bottleneck but there are still long delays for thousands of people seeking help.
Some of these applicants are not eligible for traditional unemployment (though they may be eligible for the expanded program), while others will eventually be approved for benefits. It's too bad that won't happen until after they have had to miss rent payments or other bills.
IMMEDIATE GOAL
The immediate goal should be getting as much money to people who are out of work as quickly as possible, with the goal of maintaining economic activity in every community. Distributing these funds too slowly could cause more damage to the economy than would erring on the side of giving benefits to people who are not technically eligible. The federal government has said it will audit the program rigorously, and fraudulent claims can be recovered then.
Once the state Labor Department is through this crisis, the state really should question why we have an unemployment insurance program that protects such a small percentage of our workforce.
With so many self-employed people, we ought to have a safety net that guarantees that people won't lose their health insurance or their homes when they lose their income because of economic upheaval. COVID-19 has exposed a real problem that has been affecting the self-employed during ordinary ups and downs, just on a smaller scale.
But in the near term, the Department of Labor's goal should be getting money out the door quickly. As this new wave of unemployment claims hits on Friday morning, it is past time to be overwhelmed and time to deliver the support that jobless people need.

EVICTION, RENT AND MORTGAGEs
Gov. Janet Mills has signed an executive order to help Mainers stay in their homes and keep businesses open during the state of emergency. The order prevents the immediate eviction of tenants other than those who engage in dangerous or unlawful conduct. It also strengthens the penalties for landlords who may try to evict tenants illegally, and extends the time frame for the eviction process in case courts reopen before the state of emergency is terminated.
The state has partnered with MaineHousing to create the COVID-19 Rent Relief Program for Mainers who cannot pay their rent because of the coronavirus outbreak. The $5 million program will allow households that meet certain income and ability to pay requirements to receive a one-time payment up to $500 to be paid directly to their landlord. More information can be found at mainehousing.org/programs-services/rental/rentaldetail/covid-19-rental-relief-program
Mills also urged financial institutions to work with homeowners and small businesses. Mills asked them to avoid initiating residential and commercial foreclosures and pause any open proceedings during this time.
INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE CDC
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a lot of useful information at its coronavirus website, including a section dedicated to stress and coping. Other important topics addressed include symptoms and testing, prevention and what to do if you become sick. The web address is: cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html.
HOW DO I FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT?
Lawmakers have passed an emergency law that includes benefits for displaced employees who intend to return to the same employer. It waives the requirement that they search for a job, as well as a weeklong waiting period to be eligible for benefits.

MAKE SURE IT'S OPEN
Some retailers in Maine have closed stores and others have reduced hours. Before you hop in the car, check the store's website for its hours.

Texto completo: Business owners in Stage 1 say it will be a slow process as they try to adhere to state guidelines for bringing the economy back to life.
Owners of a select variety of businesses that will be allowed to reopen Friday under Gov. Janet Mills' phased economic recovery plan are approaching the milestone with a mix of eagerness and trepidation.
Dani Nisbet, who owns the Belissimo hair salon in South Portland, said she won't actually reopen until Saturday at the earliest. She said the hair stylists who rent space in her salon are eager to work, but she wants to make sure the salon is ready.
"They're so anxious to get back to work," Nisbet said. But learning the new rules and meeting all the requirements to reopen "is a lot. It's a really hard way to do business."
The Maine Department of Economic and Community Development planned to publish guidelines on its website starting Wednesday afternoon for businesses that will be allowed to reopen Friday. Those businesses include non-critical health care providers, hair salons, barbershops, auto dealerships, car washes, drive-in movie theaters, some outdoor recreation providers and a few other limited operations.
Businesses that download and follow the state's guidelines can get a "badge" to display their compliance, which the state said is intended to reassure consumers about patronizing the newly reopened businesses and to make sure the reopening doesn't contribute to a resurgence of the coronavirus.
Nisbet is eager to start making money again, but wants to be sure that her customers and stylists are safe. Stylists will wear protective face masks and gloves, she said, and customers will have to wear face masks. Three of the stylists' chairs are in private rooms, she said, and only two or three customers at a time will be permitted in the five chairs in the main part of her Ocean Street salon. Those who are waiting will be allowed on a porch area but not in the main salon, Nisbet said.
Belissimo is undergoing a thorough cleaning and disinfecting process this week, Nisbet said, and she also plans to hang shower curtains between the chairs. Beyond that, she's waiting to see the state requirements to make sure she can open.
Other stylists plan to sit out Friday's opening, as well.
Jennifer Jaye Leigh, the owner of O2 salon in Portland, plans to follow the city's later opening date in mid-May, even though the state law takes precedence and Portland officials have vowed to suspend enforcement of the stricter municipal order. Leigh said she will open her doors May 18, with restrictions on the number of customers and other limits.
Leigh is still waiting for a shipment of masks and gloves she ordered, and she doesn't want to rush the return to business.
"I know people are really excited to get their hair cut and colored," she said, "but I think it's really important to take care of the community. It's definitely going to be a different world."
Leigh's stylists are employees rather than contractors, and she was able to obtain financial aid from the federal government to help them through the shutdown.
'I'M GOING TO BE WEARING A MASK'
Aminata D. Ford plans a limited opening for her Ami's Salon in Mill Creek in South Portland on Saturday, and then "the whole shebang will start on Monday."
Like others, she's waiting to see the state guidelines to help her determine what she needs to do to reopen.
Ford was out for a drive with her 13-year-old daughter Tuesday afternoon when she started receiving texts and then a phone call from customers asking if she would be reopening. As of early Wednesday afternoon, she wasn't certain what requirements she would need to meet in order to start cutting hair again.
"I'm going to be wearing a mask and gloves, and I'm going to ask my customers to wear a mask," she said.
She's also asking customers not to arrive before their appointed times. She plans to disinfect her workspace after every customer.
"Because my salon is very small and it's only me, I think it will be very easy to manage," she said. "And I'm a very clean person in the first place."
Ford said she's excited about getting back to work but also a bit wary.
"I'm scared because this (virus) is still there and there's no vaccine yet," she said. "I'm also worried that if I don't go back and other salons will be open, my customers will go somewhere else. But I know my customers like me and I like them a lot. I love seeing them. They make me happy."
Ford said the forced time off has allowed her to spend more time with her daughter, playing volleyball outside and working in their yard. She admits to being surprised hair salons were among the first wave of businesses allowed to reopen.
"I didn't know my job was this important until this happened," she said. "There's other stuff that's more important than haircuts."
FOR SOME, MINIMAL CHANGES
Some businesses said they will only have to make minimal changes to meet the state guidelines.
Daniel Doucette, the general manager of Prime Motor Cars in Scarborough, said the dealership was able to continue operating by largely eliminating contact between customers and workers. Cars are left outside with the keys in so customers can take test drives, Doucette said, and negotiations are handled over the phone. Paperwork for the buyers is left in the car, he said.
Prime Motor Cars has been moving toward a model that limits much of the dealer-buyer interaction, he said. The dealership operates a YouTube channel that spotlights cars available at the Mercedes-Benz dealership. One car caught the attention of a woman in Dallas who bought it, and the dealership arranged to have it delivered to her in Texas, Doucette said.
The dealership produces individual video walkarounds of specific models for potential customers, he said. The approach has meant that a closed showroom since mid-March has produced only a small hiccup in sales. Doucette said the dealership sold 19 cars this month - with two days left to go - compared with 22 sales in April 2019.
Doucette said he bought adhesive circles for the showroom floor to advise customers where to stand when it reopens, and all employees will wear face masks for in-person interactions with customers.
But the reopening of businesses amid the pandemic brings with it a changed legal landscape, said Peter Lowe, a lawyer with the firm Brann and Isaacson in Lewiston.
"It's keeping me busy," Lowe said.
The state's plan to post requirements for reopening businesses on Wednesday with the implementation on Friday is "a short time frame" for many, he said.
Lowe said business owners should resist the temptation to let customer demand drive them to reopen too soon. A customer who gets coronavirus at a business could sue for negligence if he or she can prove that the business did not take the proper steps to protect them. Following state guidelines should prove a good defense, Lowe said.
asking about employees' health
The pandemic also means employers can get a little more inquisitive about employees' health, he said. Asking if they've been sick, checking for fevers and requiring virus tests would likely have been off-limits in the past, Lowe said, but federal officials have indicated that it's allowed now because the pandemic is a direct threat to the public's health and safety.
At least one hair salon is opening Friday morning, but its operator is restarting slowly with only three customers per day.
"I've been on the phone for hours and hours trying to work it out, and I think I've got it down now," said Cindi Bartlett of Portland, who runs Opus Hair Studio.
Bartlett said she has already been in touch with the state about the necessary safety checklist.
"I have my own checklist that I think is going to be even more strong," she said Wednesday afternoon, before the DECD had made any checklists available. "Both myself and my clients will be wearing masks, for sure. I'm only seeing a limited amount of people a day."
Bartlett is making certain requests of customers, including that they come showered and clean, and not straight from the grocery store or another public place.
"The more they limit their exposure, the better for everyone who sits in my chair," she said. "I obviously don't want someone to sit in my chair who just went to Maine Med to sit with their dying mother. Sometimes you just have to spell this out."
The salon's mascot, a 7-year-old gray cockapoo named Luci, has been accompanying Bartlett to work since the dog was 3 months old. She wouldn't be able to understand why people can't touch her, so Bartlett is leaving her at home.
