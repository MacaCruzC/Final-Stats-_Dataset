Texto completo: Oh yeah, the Finals.
The NBA season is supposed to lead dramatically to this point but was widely believed to be over before it started with the Warriors coming off three titles in four seasons … having lost the one in 2016 after leading the Cavaliers 3-1… with no LeBron James-led contender arising in the East to worry about.
Instead, it’s the Toronto Raptors with their star/upcoming free agent, Kawhi Leonard, and trash-talking rapper/co-owner, Drake, representing the East and, in an upset, taking a 1-0 lead.
Unfortunately, Leonard played hurt last series as his uncle/adviser, Dennis Robertson, told Yahoo’s Chris Haynes (“You could clearly see he was in pain.”)
Nor did Kawhi look too bouncy in Game 1, scoring 23 points and shooting 5 for 14 from the field.
So, lead or no lead, good luck, Raptors!
The matchup looked so one-sided, Warriors players were being asked before it started if Steph Curry would finally be the Finals MVP … based, of course, on the assumption that injured Kevin Durant won’t be a major factor and that wouldn’t matter to the team.
Meanwhile, the New York Times’ Marc Stein introduced his plan for the anticipated walkover: multiple postseason tournaments like European soccer teams.
Compounding the absurdity, Commissioner Adam Silver told Stein that a second “cup” was “in the conceptual phase.”
As if the league needs a new attraction with a boffo comedy going as Magic Johnson continued to bash the Lakers while pledging undying love to them?
It was another crazy week with ESPN.com’s Baxter Holmes producing a 6,500-word opus on Johnson’s misbegotten era … while ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith melted down on the air, decrying his own company’s story.
Smith is Magic’s guy at The Wide World of Sports. As Stephen A. actually noted, he was embarrassed to have Johnson coming in the same day Holmes’ piece ran, in which Magic was alleged to be an abusive boss who had several Lakers staffers resigning and/or taking anti-anxiety medication.
Ranted Stephen A. in Johnson’s defense:
“Oh my god! Let’s get the ax! Let’s take Magic Johnson to the guillotine!”
Of course, with Johnson determined to keep going on the air to defend himself, these coincidences in timing are becoming common … like the week before when Magic went on to call GM Rob Pelinka a back-stabber, the same day the Lakers introduced Coach Frank Vogel in their first press conference since Johnson’s resignation 41 days before.
In the part we didn’t know before, Holmes reported James’ agent, Rich Paul, waged a season-long campaign against Coach Luke Walton.
This was confirmed by Silver, himself. In an early-season chance meeting, the commissioner said Paul told him something to the effect of, “Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.”
Assuming that Paul’s opinions followed James’, and Johnson’s followed LeBron’s, this explains why Magic went off on Walton at the seven-game mark, turning Luke into a lame duck.
LeBron knows he’s held to the highest standards and has done this before, trying and failing to get Erik Spoelstra fired in Miami, succeeding in getting David Blatt fired in Cleveland.
In this, James was joined by Johnson, feeling exposed after his controversial decisions to forego shooters and sign eccentrics such as JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley.
Not that Magic was supposed to take orders from James. With LeBron locked up for three seasons, it was the other way around.
It was Johnson’s job to make James understand they might have to sacrifice this season to finish rebuilding after saving a maximum salary slot and bringing in so many veterans on one-year deals.
What Magic wasn’t supposed to do was go off on Walton before Thanksgiving on LeBron’s behalf, undercutting what little stability they had.
Of course, conveying that message meant realizing it, himself. By all accounts, Magic didn’t, talking of building for the future while challenging Golden State at the same time.
A Lakers staffer told Holmes he didn’t know if Johnson had a plan. Actually, Magic did … or LeBron did … and it was a dilly: Trade for Anthony Davis, off-loading enough salary to save their max slot for another star free agent to put alongside James.
Unfortunately for Magic, it proved impossible with New Orleans blaming the Lakers for their heavy-handed, obviously LeBron-driven, wooing of A.D.
Worst of all for Johnson, he wasn’t working at the Lakers job full-time and couldn’t live it down when it got into the press.
“And last but not least, lazy?” Magic told Stephen A. last week, re-framing the charge into one he could lampoon.
“I have built a $600 million business. You can not be lazy going from basketball and winning five championships. … I wasn’t lazy as a player and I’m not lazy as a CEO and a business owner. That’s never going to happen.”
Of course, no one said he was lazy. The charge was that he wasn’t often in the Lakers’ office, which he hasn’t addressed.
Holmes, noting Johnson’s many business interests, suggests he was in their office “once a week or every two weeks.”
Infrequent as that was, it could have been OK if Johnson had a smooth working relationship with an experienced No. 2 man who assigned all the detail work.
Imagine if Jeanie Buss had kept GM Mitch Kupchak, who had all the qualifications, instead of lumping Mitch in with her brother, Jim, when she fired him.
The No. 2 man became Pelinka, an agent, hired at the suggestion of his client, Kobe Bryant, neither of whom had front office experience.
As for Johnson’s inconceivable charge of being stabbed in the back … still unspecified aside from citing “little things that bothered me” … he had more than two seasons with Pelinka. If loyalty was an issue, Magic should have been able to tell long before.
Unfortunately for the Lakers and Jeanie, who kept Pelinka, Rob is now lumped in with Johnson in the press, as if he was Magic’s partner in crime … setting up Pelinka as the scapegoat for the next thing that goes wrong.
Actually, Pelinka looks more like another of the staffers Magic ran roughshod over.
Pelinka, reported Holmes, survived with the avid support of Jeanie’s best friend and new Lakers power player, Linda Rambis.
Now to see how long any of them, Rob and/or Linda, last.
If there’s a silver lining for Lakers fans, it’s that the heat in the press is exposing an organization run on nepotism and cronyism, which Jeanie might finally be obliged to recognize and professionalize.
Of course, that suggests more misadventures await in the meantime so buckle up.

Texto completo: It's long been obvious that the Trump administration wants to turn the 2020 Census into a political weapon, inserting a question on citizenship to intimidate immigrants from being counted, thereby depressing the clout of diverse, left-leaning states like California and New York.
As officials claimed otherwise under oath in Congress and in courts, evidence of their true intent mounted. Now the pile is about to fall over, hopefully on the Supreme Court floor.
The prevarications began with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' claim, in testimony to a House Committee, that the question was included at the request of the Justice Department, to fulfill Voting Rights Act obligations.
Internal documents and Commerce staffers later revealed that was pure pretext.
In January, Ross lost the argument in federal court, in a case brought by New York, 16 other states, seven cities and many other groups. With deadlines to finalize questionnaires approaching, a seemingly friendlier Supreme Court is set to rule soon on an appeal.
In a just world, Thursday's bombshell New York Times story would settle the matter decisively: Files discovered in recently deceased Republican redistricting expert Tom Hofeller's estate revealed the cynical genesis of the push.
A 2015 Hofeller paper, later shared with the Trump administration, pushed for including the question explicitly to reduce Hispanic numbers and enhance, via post-census gerrymandered maps, the electoral advantage of "Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites."
In court, of course, the administration hid Hofeller's role and pushed the bogus voting-rights line. Will the offenders be sanctioned? They must.
Given the extraordinary timing, the revelations are unlikely to influence the court's deliberations. A crying shame. This is daylight robbery.

Texto completo: Ecuador Indigenous land rights are being acknowledged in the Amazon. A landmark case has granted the Waorani community of Ecuador the right to self-determination, ruling that the government could not sell their lands without fair consent from the community. The government had divided Ecuador’s portion of the Amazon into sections for international auction, including Waorani land. The Waorani filed a lawsuit, saying that they had not received fair consultation throughout this process. On April 26, a regional court granted Waorani lands protection from oil drilling, which sets a precedent for six other tribal territories that could have been auctioned for oil drilling. The Waorani people say that this case protects their rainforest lands from harmful contamination. A Waorani leader told a reporter, “We have shown the government to respect us, and the other indigenous people of the world.” (The New Yorker)
United Kingdom Marathons are minimizing their environmental footprint. This year, the London Marathon cut single-use plastic water bottles by more than 215,000 by placing water stations at fewer, more strategic locations. Edible water pods made from seaweed were offered as an alternative at a designated mile marker. Organizers aim to have the race produce zero waste next year. Earth-friendly initiatives have also taken hold in the United States: Many marathons now use metallic race blankets that can be repurposed, collect discarded race clothes for donation, and make compost bins available at the finish lines for food waste. (The New York Times)
United States Atlanta has an innovative approach to addressing homelessness among ex-convicts. Former prisoners often have a difficult time finding housing. They are also 10 times more likely to become homeless than the general population, according to a recent report by the Prison Policy Initiative. A Metro Reentry Facility in Atlanta is the first transitional state prison of its kind; it serves as a place for offenders to live for 18 months prior to their release date. The facility aims to have “returning citizens” leave with a job and a home. It provides counseling, vocational training, and housing support. (The Pew Charitable Trusts)
Denmark The Faroe Islands, an out-of-the-way tourist destination, has a new venture: “voluntourism.” This spring the islands pursued a creative way to maintain tourist sites. The islands closed sites for two days and recruited volunteers willing to pay their own way there and help out in exchange for food and lodging. One resident told a reporter that he was amazed at how much was achieved in just two days; volunteers were able to complete 10 projects over the weekend while prioritizing collaboration with locals. “Closed for maintenance” weekends such as this one could serve as a model for other remote destination communities that are looking for ways to maintain their pristine environment while sharing it with others. (BBC)
Worldwide Overall, airplane travel has become much safer. Air-travel specialists point to aircraft and airport design improvements, better air traffic control, and improved pilot training as contributing factors. Aviation experts consider the most recent plane accidents – notably the two Boeing 737 Max crashes – a “statistical blip.” Injury and fatality rates worldwide are much lower than in the 1990s. According to the Flight Safety Foundation, from 1996 to 2017 plane fatalities decreased by 96%. And despite an increase in 2018, that year was still among the top 10 safest years in terms of the number of fatal accidents, according to the Aviation Safety Network. (The Associated Press)

Files: Census question aided GOP; Dead strategist's info emerges ahead of high court's ruling

Texto completo: Just weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to white Republicans.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died in August.
It reveals that Hofeller "played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' " and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller's role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.
Furman was one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year.
The letter drew on information discovered on Hofeller's hard drives, which were found by Hofeller's estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina.
The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census "would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats" and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers' letter to Furman.
The evidence, first reported by The New York Times, contradicts testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' expert adviser Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said.
The Commerce and Justice departments did not respond to questions about the new information.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in district court Thursday for "sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony" by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU.
It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU on Thursday afternoon filed a letter with the court to "respectfully inform" it of the motion filed in New York District Court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week.
The letter repeated the charge contained in the earlier letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census to give white Republicans an advantage in redistricting "and that Petitioners (the government) obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations."
The letter from Ho did not ask the court to take action, but it drew its attention to the new motion. The hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
"Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census," Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. "Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday's hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments."
The Supreme Court heard the case April 23.
Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.
The court, if it followed normal procedure, voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are now writing the opinion.
The ACLU also asked the district court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public.
On Thursday, Furman ordered that the government must provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday; he called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump's election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said.
"It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing," he said.
Ho said sanctions could include fines imposed on witnesses or the government, a reopening of the case or an amendment of the final judgment to account for new evidence.
The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and to determine congressional representation and redistricting. Opponents of the citizenship question have argued that it will suppress response to the survey among immigrant communities, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live.

Hackers Hold Baltimore Hostage; Ransomware has shut down the city's computers for three weeks, as officials play the blame game.

Texto completo: Discontent in Baltimore is usually high at this time of the spring as Orioles fans already watch their playoff hopes fade. But this year local residents have more to be angry about. For more than three weeks the city government's computers have been offline. That means no emails have been going in or out of city hall, and the systems used to settle parking fines, pay water bills, property taxes and more are out of commission. These are online systems that most of us take for granted—until they stop working.
Baltimore's IT infrastructure is being held hostage by ransomware, the malicious code used to hijack online systems and extort users for payment. The hackers' ransom note demanded their payment in cryptocurrency: 13 bitcoins (worth about $100,000) in exchange for total control, or an à la carte option of 3 bitcoins per computer system. Mayor Jack Young has rightly refused to pay these nameless and faceless criminals. But pressure is mounting to find a solution.
Failing that, some city officials thought they'd at least found an excuse when the New York Times reported over the weekend that a "cyber weapon" stolen from the National Security Agency in 2017 had "boomeranged back" against Baltimore. City Council President Brandon Scott is now pointing his finger at the neighboring spy agency and petitioning the federal government for reparations in the form of emergency funds to cover most of the estimated $18.2 million in damages.
Nice try, Mr. Scott. Baltimore faces an emergency, but it's not of the NSA's doing. It's true that the city government's vulnerability resides in old Microsoft software that, according to former NSA employees, the NSA had been lawfully exploiting for years to gather intelligence. The NSA disclosed the bug to Microsoft in 2017 after the spy agency reportedly learned that its tool had been stolen by a hacking group called the Shadow Brokers. Microsoft promptly released a "patch," an update that would render the hacking tool useless. But two years later, Baltimore still hasn't implemented the fixes across its vulnerable infrastructure.
These troubles are not unique to Baltimore; the same malware has been reported in Texas and Pennsylvania. Last year the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey unsealed an indictment against two Iranians who, beginning in 2015, allegedly unleashed ransomware on more than 200 victims, including municipal governments, state agencies and hospital networks in 43 states. That two hackers can wreak havoc with tens of thousands of systems, causing $30 million in damages, should trouble all Americans who entrust state and local governments with personal information and rely on them for critical, sometimes lifesaving, services.
So who's at fault? It would be easy to blame Baltimore's elected officials and their technology staff for not fixing their systems. I might do so myself if not for my experience maintaining a vast and federated array of legacy infrastructure during my tenure in state government. Updating and repairing a network of old servers comes at a massive cost, with significant human-capital requirements that place governments at a unique disadvantage relative to industry, which has far more access to funding and talent. I also spent countless hours on the phone with municipal ransomware victims as they weighed two bad options: Give in to the hackers' demands and hope for the best, or refuse to pay and deprive constituents of services.
These attacks will continue and intensify unless two things happen. First, software and hardware manufacturers must begin to cater to the lowest common denominator when building hacking-mitigation techniques into their products. Governments and companies should be able to easily patch their computers the way ordinary consumers update their iPhones. Only then can we reasonably transfer more liability from the technology's makers to its users and elevate barriers to entry for hackers. For now, more liability should reside with the makers.
Second, the federal government must find and bring to justice bad actors in cyberspace. Someone, somewhere is responsible for waging a digital assault on an American city. Instead of blaming the NSA, Baltimore's officials should ask for its help in tracking down these criminals. Perhaps the NSA can also lend Baltimore a hand in getting back online.
In addition, members of Congress and executive-branch officials should debate when and how the NSA discloses software bugs to U.S. and foreign companies. The public deserves greater assurances that NSA tools won't fall into the wrong hands.
The Trump administration has done more than any previous administration to address this problem. In November 2017 it spelled out a transparent and fair process to "disseminate vulnerability information to the vendor/supplier in the expectation that it will be patched, or to temporarily restrict the knowledge of the vulnerability" to the U.S. government for national-security purposes. The man behind this transparency, former White House cyber czar Rob Joyce, also led the NSA unit that reportedly built the since-stolen tool.
The need to balance security and privacy is greater in the digital age than ever before. Let's not forget that Baltimore is a victim. It's time for governments and agencies to stop blaming each other and unite against the attackers.

Texto completo:  WASHINGTON -- The cascading effects of U.S. protectionism on U.S. producers and consumers constitute an ongoing tutorial about what Daniel Patrick Moynihan called "iatrogenic government." In medicine, an iatrogenic ailment is one inadvertently caused by a physician or medicine. Iatrogenic government -- except the damage it currently is doing is not inadvertent -- was on display last week.
The Trump administration unveiled a plan to disburse $16 billion to farmers as balm for wounds -- predictable and predicted -- from the retaliation of other nations, especially China, against U.S. exports in response to the administration's tariffs. The $16 billion does not need to be approved by Congress because not much that presidents do nowadays needs to be. The president said the sum will be paid for by the billions of dollars the Treasury takes in from China. The evident sincerity of his frequently reiterated belief that exporters to the United States pay the tariffs that U.S. importers and consumers pay is more alarming than mere meretriciousness would be.
The $16 billion is not the first such tranche ($12 billion was disbursed last year) and the $28 billion probably will not be the government's final restitution, using other people's money, for damages it is doing. So, taxpayers who are paying more for imported goods covered by the administration's tariffs (which are taxes Americans pay) are also paying to compensate some other Americans for injuries inflicted on them in response to the tariffs that are injuring the taxpayers.
President Donald Trump, who deserves Winston Churchill's description of U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (a "bull ...who carries his china closet with him"), has tweeted that the government could buy $15 billion worth of surplus commodities (for you keeping score at home, that would bring tariff compensation for farmers to $43 billion) from U.S farmers ("@POTUS loves his farmers") and ship the commodities to developing nations. What could possibly go wrong?
In a masterpiece of understatement, Darci Vetter, President Barack Obama's chief agricultural trade negotiator, told Politico that this could have "serious market implications" in recipient countries. Implications such as the devastation of local agriculture, the largest industry in many developing nations.
The administration might be pleased that some non-Chinese companies that manufacture in China are moving production elsewhere to avoid U.S. tariffs on goods from China, thereby slowing that nation's economy. What could possibly go wrong? Presumably the administration has thought through the consequences of promoting an economic slowdown in the country that buys many U.S. goods -- e.g., China is one of Boeing's biggest customers, and Cadillac sells more cars in China than in America.
Zachary Karabell, an investor writing in The Wall Street Journal, has noted that China is not as vulnerable to U.S. pressure as Japan was in the 1980s, when the U.S. purchased about a third of Japanese exports and supplied about half of its foreign investment and much of its national defense. "China has a $700 billion trade relationship with the U.S., including imports and exports, but it has a $3 trillion trade relationship with the rest of the world."
The New York Times recently reported that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of an administration that purports to be a dike against a rising tide of socialism, is "encouraging (U.S.) firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere" -- meaning, out of China. Capitalists believe that market signals, not political appointees with political agendas, give satisfactory encouragement for reasonable commercial behaviors.
Today's system is capitalism leavened by cronyism and administered by know-it-alls. What could possibly go wrong? A report by a Federal Reserve researcher and two University of Chicago economists has found that tariffs on washing machines raised their cost by $86 on average -- but also raised the prices of dryers by $92 as, The New York Times reports, "manufacturers of laundry equipment used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on things that were not, in fact, affected by the tariffs." The tariffs, according to the report, have created about 1,800 American manufacturing jobs, but at a cost of over $817,000 a job.
This is the art of the deal as practiced by him who relishes his self-bestowed sobriquet "Tariff Man," and who explains tariffs this way: "When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so." Is that clear? Perhaps not, but this is: Protectionism is yet another example of government being the disease for which it pretends to be the cure.

Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Enthusiasm; Biden leads in a new poll, but the Marxist senator remains the clear second choice among Democrats.

Texto completo: "Don't believe the polls," says the Biden for President organization in an email to supporters today. It is perhaps an odd message coming from the clear leader in numerous surveys of Democratic primary voters. But former Vice President Joe Biden and his team don't want any potential donor to think they don't need additional funds. Money aside, there's a lingering question about the enthusiasm with which Democrats are embracing Mr. Biden. Meanwhile, chief rival Bernie Sanders seems as enthusiastic as ever about his Marxist ideology.
A new Morning Consult poll shows Mr. Biden with an 18-point lead over Mr. Sanders among Democrats nationwide, and the Biden lead swells to 22 points when only voters in early primary states are counted. All the other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination remain well behind Mr. Sanders in the survey.
However, New York City's own Mayor Bill de Blasio stands alone with the highest negative rating. A full 20% of Democratic primary voters have already formed an unfavorable impression of his honor. Given that 33% of respondents haven't yet heard of Mr. de Blasio and another 27% have heard of him but haven't yet formed an opinion, the pride of Gotham still has plenty of room to grow his negative rating as the campaign progresses.
As for the front runner, Team Biden warns in today's fundraising pitch: "Polls change every day. The only way to keep our lead is to continue to get out there, knock doors, hold events and talk to voters." Events and voters are surely areas of particular concern to the Biden camp. Marc Caputo and Natasha Korecki of Politico ask :
So where are the big energetic crowds, the lines around the block to get into Joe Biden's events?
The question is no small matter in a party still recovering from a bitter 2016 defeat — a loss marked by a lack of enthusiasm for an establishment nominee in several critical states.
Attendance at the former vice president's launch rally paled next to some of his rivals. In his first Iowa visit, he didn't match the crowds that greeted Elizabeth Warren or even the less well-known Pete Buttigieg in their initial visits. So far, he's kept his events to smaller venues where there's little danger of empty seats.
If support for Mr. Biden proves too thin to withstand the upcoming schedule of Democratic candidate debates, Mr. Sanders is well positioned to capitalize. The Morning Consult poll finds that he's the most popular second choice among Biden supporters, and Sen. Sanders enjoys a favorable impression among 74% of Democratic voters, with just 17% holding an unfavorable view. These numbers are nearly as strong as Mr. Biden's. So it's important for voters to know the unique danger for American liberty and prosperity presented by Mr. Sanders.
Recently Alexander Burns and Sydney Ember of the New York Times noted Mr. Sanders' history of friendly relations with communist despots. In a follow-up interview with Ms. Ember, the Vermont socialist made it clear that his views have barely evolved since the collapse of the Soviet empire. In the following excerpt, Ms. Ember's bolded questions relate to Mr. Sanders's 1985 visit to Nicaragua to support the Marxist regime of Daniel Ortega, who has lately been accused of crimes against humanity by Amnesty International. Responses from Mr. Sanders appear in regular text:
Q. In the top of our story, we talk about the rally you attended in Managua and a wire report at the time said that there were anti-American chants from the crowd.
The United States at that time — I don't know how much you know about this — was actively supporting the Contras to overthrow the government. So that there's anti-American sentiment? I remember that, I remember that event very clearly.
You do recall hearing those chants? I think the wire report has them saying, "Here, there, everywhere, the Yankee will die."
They were fighting against American —— Huh huh —— yes, what is your point?
I wanted to ——
Are you shocked to learn that there was anti-American sentiment?
My point was I wanted to know if you had heard that.
I don't remember, no. Of course there was anti-American sentiment there. This was a war being funded by the United States against the people of Nicaragua. People were being killed in that war.
Do you think if you had heard that directly, you would have stayed at the rally?
I think Sydney, with all due respect, you don't understand a word that I'm saying.
Given additional opportunity to comment by Ms. Ember, Mr. Sanders did not condemn the anti-American chants heard at the communist rally he attended, nor did he detail the misery inflicted by communists on the people of Latin America. Instead, he seized the opportunity to articulate an anti-American version of the region's history.
Under further questioning, he grudgingly admitted that his old Marxist pals are anti-democratic and argued that while promoting admirable principles, the Soviet Union "provided things to people either free or inexpensively, but the quality was not very good." Unmentioned by Mr. Sanders was the fact that worldwide, close to 100 million people were killed by communism over the last century. That too was not very good.

Moderate Is a Relative Term
In a Wednesday note to clients, Andy Laperriere of Cornerstone Macro describes the Biden policy agenda, which may concern investors but ought to make Democratic activists more enthusiastic. Observes Mr. Laperriere:
Nothing better illustrates... that there are no major issues on which Biden breaks party ranks than the fact that progressives are attacking him for opposing busing in the 1970s (so far back that most of those progressives doing the attacking were not even alive) and not sticking up enough for Anita Hill in 1991. We were around for the Clarence Thomas nomination; Biden was no friend of Clarence Thomas. Those are pretty weak grounds on which to attack Biden's liberal bona fides. The attacks on ancient history underscore the fact that from a substantive point of view, there isn't a major issue where Biden's position is closer to the GOP position than the Democratic position. He's a down-the-line liberal.

Daily on Energy: Utilities warned EPA about hamstringing natural gas and renewables with a coal-only climate rule

UTILITIES WARNED EPA ABOUT HAMSTRINGING NATURAL GAS AND RENEWABLES WITH A COAL-ONLY CLIMATE RULE: The Environmental Protection Agency faces a major decision in whether to heed a utility industry warning as it finalizes its revised version of Obama-era climate rules for power plants next month.
The latest White House unified regulatory agenda, released just days ahead of the Memorial Day holiday recess, shows the Affordable Clean Energy rule being made final sometime in June, nearly a year after it was first proposed. The regulation is meant to replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, a key piece of former President Barack Obama’s climate change agenda.
The utility industry’s question is whether the final rule will allow it to follow its own clean energy path, rather than meet the goals of the rule.
The utilities, represented by the Edison Electric Institute, told EPA last fall that they wanted assurances that the ACE rule would not interfere in company activities to install more natural gas and renewable energy. EEI stated that some of its companies are seeking to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050, with other members seeking even more aggressive targets.
The large utility group warned that a lack of flexibility to continue the transition to cleaner energy would raise prices by focusing states on less-competitive energy resources like coal.
The emission reductions expected to be achieved under the ACE rule are moot: EPA has suggested that the ACE Rule will reduce U.S. power sector emissions by around 34% below 2005 levels. “However, those projected reductions have largely already been achieved due to the on-going fleet transition” from coal to natural gas and renewables, EEI explained.
The utility industry is concerned that the ACE rule’s preference for investing in coal plants to make them more efficient, and thus cleaner, could upset the energy “transformation” the country is currently undergoing, harming billions of dollars of investments and the jobs that go with them.
“EPA must consider this transformation if the Agency finalizes these proposals and provide [power plant] owners and operators and states significant compliance flexibility, consistent with the requirements of the [law],” EEI stated.
Failure to provide the flexibility “has the potential to undermine not only the clean energy transition by increasing costs for electricity customers, but also EPA’s proposed ACE rule itself, by increasing the economic burdens imposed on the remaining existing coal-based ... fleet.”
The EPA is also slated to make final a separate action repealing the Clean Power Plan. The action would coincide with the two-year anniversary of President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal on June 1.

NUCLEAR POWER COULD FALL BY TWO-THIRDS, HARMING CLIMATE CHANGE FIGHT: Nuclear power could decline by 25% in developed countries such as the U.S. by 2025 and as much as two-thirds by 2040, a result that would setback efforts to combat climate change, according to a report Tuesday by the International Energy Agency.
If nuclear power falls by two-thirds, carbon emissions could rise by an additional 4 billion tons by 2040, the report warns.
“Without an important contribution from nuclear power, the global energy transition will be that much harder,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “Unless the barriers it faces are overcome, its role will soon be on a steep decline worldwide, particularly in the United States, Europe and Japan.”
The nuclear picture: Nuclear is the second-largest low carbon electricity source in the world, providing 10%, behind hydropower. It is the largest low-carbon electricity provider in developed countries such as the U.S., supplying 18% in 2018. However nuclear is struggling with old plants — averaging 35 years old in developed countries — beginning to close, partly because of policies, but mostly because of competition from cheaper gas and renewables.
Renewables not ready to close the gap: But wind and solar aren’t ready to replace nuclear, the IEA warns, projecting the use of renewables would have to accelerate to an “unprecedented level.”
How policy could help: The IEA suggests policymakers change electricity market rules to better capture the environmental and energy security value of nuclear. It said regulators should extend the operation of nuclear plants slated to expire. Countries should also support the design of advanced modular reactors, IEA says.
WIND TURBINE SALES RISE 7%, CHINA TAKES THE LEAD: Wind turbine sales rose 7% in the first quarter of 2019, compared to last year, with Chinese demand for the clean energy technology representing the largest portion of the increase.
The new orders eclipsed the previous record seen in the first quarter of 2018, a new report released Tuesday by energy consultants Wood Mackenzie showed.
The data revealed that orders from both China and the Americas helped to offset weak sales in Europe, the Mideast, Africa and Asia-Pacific nations, “where procurement decisions have been impacted by regulatory transitions,” the new report said.
China’s lead: Sales in China placed it in the top customer spot for wind turbines as new utility regulations to connect more renewables to the grid. China’s wind market yielded a 66% year-over-year increase in orders, while Europe sales dropped 55% in the first quarter.
The Danish company Vestas remains the top wind turbine manufacturer to fulfill these wind turbine orders, according to the report.
DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEYS GENERAL SAY TRUMP’S ORDER TO LIMIT STATE PIPELINE AUTHORITY IS ILLEGAL: A coalition of 16 Democratic state attorneys general is warning the Trump administration that the president’s recent executive order limiting state authority over oil and gas pipelines is illegal.
Trump signed an executive order April 10 designed to limit the instances in which blue states such as New York can reject pipeline projects using authority granted to states in Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Section 401 allows states to deny permits if leaks from an energy infrastructure project could harm nearby streams or lakes.
In a comment letter, the Democratic attorneys general argue that any change to EPA’s “guidance and regulations” under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act would violate the law.
They say the law provides states the primary authority to protect water quality within their borders, allowing for “broad discretion” in making decisions over pipeline certifications.
“New York will always defend the right to ensure the people of our state have access to clean water, period,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES ON BILL TO BOOST COAL SLUDGE FOR STEEL: A bipartisan group of senators and congressmen introduced a bill Friday that would subsidize the use of coal sludge to produce steel.
The Steel Industry Preservation Act, introduced by lawmakers from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, would institute a tax credit for 10 years for the coal sludge to be recycled for use in steel making.
Rep. Mike Doyle, a Democrat, introduced the bill with his Republican colleague in the Pennsylvania delegation, Mike Kelly.
Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V. and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio authored the Senate version.

Texto completo: The Supreme Court upheld an Indiana law Tuesday that requires the burial or cremation of fetal remains following an abortion, further fanning the flames in the abortion debate nationwide.
I'm still pro-choice, but the left worries me
By Saritha Prabhu
On abortion, extremism rules.
We're increasingly seeing the debate being dominated by the extremists on both sides. We've also seen, in the past few years, the debate shifting on many fronts. The political left has gone from at least paying lip service to the Bill Clinton standard of "safe, legal and rare" to increasing comfort with more abortion.
The zeitgeist trend on the liberal side is toward the almost-celebratory, in-your-face tone seen in "Shout your abortion," and also abortion-rights-expanding bills in Virginia, New York and elsewhere.
The right has met this with its own monstrous counterpart: The recent Alabama law is precisely designed to challenge the Supreme Court to take up the case — a ban on abortion except to protect the life of the mother and serious jail time for abortion providers.

But there is another crucial front, and that is science — a science debate advancing to reveal ever more wondrous detail of burgeoning life in the womb.
The challenge is that advancing neonatal research and technology keeps throwing a monkey wrench into the debate. It denies us the luxury and self-delusion of thinking about the fetus as a clump of cells beyond the early weeks of pregnancy.
Which is not to say that abortion should be outlawed, only that we adjust our thinking on the issue.
What is happening here is what has been happening in other political issues: The silent majority of Americans, where the squishy middle resides, is held hostage to the intractable extremities.
As we all know, extremists of any kind are fixated on principle and purity and political victory at all costs, not on pragmatism, compromise and real-world concerns. For purists on both sides, it is about righteousness and condemnation of the other side.
It is also a position where there is none of the conflicted, moral trade-offs that are often present in everyday life. And it is often undeniably about simplification of the issue.
One extreme goes with extreme autonomy to the woman, to the extent that it allows late-term abortion; the other extreme sees personhood in a fertilized embryo and is so pro-life that it'll endanger the lives of legions of women.
But for the moderates, where I count myself, the issue solves itself in simpler terms: Banning abortion is out of the question because it will only drive it underground, but most of us can manage our moral discomfort enough to be OK with abortion early on in the pregnancy; abortion in the cases of rape, incest and for the life of the mother; and in the rare, wrenching cases, later-term abortion to protect the life of the mother.
"The life of the mother. " That's a phrase with meaning. When that is supplemented with "the health of the mother," as in the New York law, pro-lifers, understandably, worry about the abuse of the exception.
Meanwhile, a few loose ends: If liberals want science to be respected on the climate issue, they must respect the science on abortion as well. They should realize that as gestation advances, a fetus comes closer to being a baby, and elective abortion up to the time of delivery essentially means terminating a human who deserves dignity and has rights.
Likewise, the pro-life community should be more supportive of more freely available birth control, and more support for pregnant women especially from impoverished backgrounds.
Personally, I'm still pro-choice, but in recent years I went from hard pro-choice to soft pro-choice. To me, the pill and Roe v. Wade were powerful for women's self-actualization, bodily autonomy and economic freedom.
But I've become increasingly discomfited by the left's brave new world of abortion triumphalism and abortion-whenever-during-pregnancy.
In an age of abortion extremism, let's be clear: Either side winning completely is to enter a realm of dystopia.
Saritha Prabhu is a columnist at the Tennesseean, where this column first appeared.
What others are saying
Gracy Olmstead, The New York Times: "The anti-abortion movement has always been passionately devoted to defending the rights of the unborn. If you believe that unborn children have rights and dignity, as I and other pro-lifers do, then ending abortion is more important than virtually any other issue we deal with as a society and has to remain the focus of our cause. . . . A consistent life ethic would urge pro-lifers to defend the vulnerable and voiceless, regardless of partisanship or ease. "
Elly Lonon, The Washington Post: "I had an abortion. I'm not going to tell you how old I was or what my circumstances were at the time. I won't mention whether birth control was used or whether it wasn't. I’m not going to tell you whether the guy is or is not still a part of my life, whether it was a one-night stand or a long-term relationship. I'm not going to discuss the health of either party involved in the consensual or nonconsensual sex, nor the viability of the embryo. None of those details are pertinent. I got pregnant. I didn't want to be pregnant. I had a medical procedure to remedy the situation. Full stop. I am not my abortion. Everything I am, however, is because of that abortion. "
Charles Dern, The (Pennsylvania) Intelligencer: "First, pro-abortion organizations have been at the forefront of suppressing medical evidence by consistently opposing laws that would mandate that a woman be shown an ultrasound of her unborn child as well as being given the facts of fetal development. Second, many secular ethicists presently stretch their credibility in that they currently are, with all sobriety, debating the morality of 'after-birth abortion,' aka, infanticide. "
What our readers are saying
This is how we do it, folks. Thanks to the Supreme Court upholding part of the Indiana law, we keep chipping away at these pro-abortion laws bit by bit. Eventually, we will prevail in saving human lives from destruction out of inconvenience.
— Larry Hubble
We are relieved that Indiana at least dropped the part of the original bill that required the family to keep the fetus at home, take it on family vacations, and send it to college . . . whew. In other words, the government of Indiana did not yet entirely take over all decisions for individuals; not yet.
— Mary Melcher
The Supreme Court delivered a small victory in establishing that an unborn baby is a person who has dignity and autonomy, and deserves a respectful burial.
— @USReading
This is sickening! This is just pushing religious beliefs onto others. God does not judge us; he loves us and understands the decisions we make. Who's making money from the Supreme Court upholding this part of the Indiana law?

Texto completo: 1. HBO's “Deadwood: The Movie" has finally arrived, nearly 13 years after the three-season series ended. Written by creator David Milch, whose Alzheimer's diagnosis has been tied to the promotion of the movie, and directed by David Minahan, it picks up a decade after the series. Returning original cast members include Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant, Molly Parker, Paula Malcomson, John Hawkes, Anna Gunn, Brad Dourif, Robin Weigert, William Sanderson, Kim Dickens, and Gerald McRaney. It's at 8 p.m. on Friday, which is the final day of eligibility for this year's Emmys.
2. I was crazy for the first season of “Luther," starring a broody, laconic Idris Elba, and increasingly less so for each of the three seasons that followed. The strain to keep Ruth Wilson's fan favorite, Alice, in the storyline has been only one of the storytelling problems. So my expectations for the fifth season, which premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on BBC America, are pretty low. Please, “Luther," surprise me.
3. I want the title of this new supernatural horror series on my license pl8. That would make me feel U4ic. “NOS4A2," pronounced Nosferatu, is about a woman with the ability to find lost things and an evil and immortal man who feeds off the souls of children — or something like that. It's based on the novel by Joe Hill, it stars Zachary Quinto and Ashleigh Cummings, and it's AMC's play to hold onto the audience of the fading “The Walking Dead." It premieres on Sunday at 10.
4. I've been enjoying FX's “Fosse/Verdon," which wraps up this week on Tuesday at 10 p.m. The acting is all-in, as Sam Rockwell goes for broke as the tortured but brilliant choreographer-director and as Michelle Williams carefully dodges impersonation as the stalwart actress-dancer. The chronicles of the making of the movie “Cabaret" and the original stage production of “Chicago" have been particularly fascinating — at times even more than the tragic love between the two giant talents.
5. CNN is dipping into comedy — I mean intentional comedy — with a filmed version of Colin Quinn's Off Broadway show “Red State, Blue State." His provocative take on the country's current state of disunion, in which he calls out liberals and conservatives, airs on Monday at 9 p.m.
6. “The Weekly" marks the New York Times' first major dip into TV news. The half-hour show, which premieres on FX on Sunday at 10 p.m., will feature a different Times journalist each week as he or she digs into a story.
7. NBC's “Songland" is “The Voice" and “American Idol" for new songwriters, who get mentored by music producers and compete to have their song recorded by the guest performer of the week. Just what TV needs: another music-related TV reality contest. The guest list for the season, which premieres Tuesday at 10 p.m., includes the Jonas Brothers, John Legend, Meghan Trainor, and Macklemore.
8. On Friday, Amazon is releasing “Good Omens," an adaptation of the 1990 novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. There's a demon played by David Tennant, an angel played by Michael Sheen, and a final battle between heaven and hell. Written by Gaiman, the six-episode season is loaded with stars (in some cases, just their voices) including Jon Hamm, Mireille Enos, Michael McKean, Miranda Richardson, Nick Offerman, Derek Jacobi, Brian Cox, Benedict Cumberbatch, and, as the voice of God, Frances McDormand.
9. Epix, which was launched in 2009, is upping its original series game with a list of new shows set to join “Get Shorty." First out of the gate is “Perpetual Grace, Ltd.," a thriller about a grifter (Jimmi Simpson) preying on a pastor (Ben Kingsley) who isn't as vulnerable as he seems. The 10-episode drama premieres on Sunday at 10 p.m.

Pardons and the power of the president

Texto completo: Earlier this month, the 45th president of the United States granted a pardon to Army Lt. Michael Behenna, who had been convicted by a courts-martial panel for the unlawful killing of an Iraqi who was in custody.
The New York Times recently reported that POTUS 45 is contemplating pardoning several other service men or Blackwater security contractors who have been convicted or stand charged with the killing of unarmed civilians or enemy captives.
Can a president pardon a person charged or convicted under U.S. law with war crimes? What war crimes?
Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution gives the president power of reprieves and pardons for "offenses against the United States, except in cases of Impeachment."
The convictions at issue arise from violations of the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate American land and naval forces. Passed by Congress in 1950 (taking effect near Memorial Day in 1950), the UCMJ is a rewriting of what was earlier called the Articles of War in effect with the military since the nation's birth.
The UCMJ is comprehensive to the conduct of all personnel from the highest to lowest ranks in all services, including Coast Guard and NOAA Commissioned officers and Public Health Service personnel when attached to a military unit or militarized by the President during a national emergency or declaration of war.
Reservists and National Guard are generally subject to the UCMJ if they are in full-time support on active duty or performing part-time inactive duty, or are retired reservists being treated in an armed forces hospital.
The application of its laws is to all such service personnel regardless of their location around the planet.
The UCMJ sets forth extensive due process procedures for the bringing of criminal charges against an accused.
For serious breaches of the UCMJ, courts-martial are held to determine guilt. These are trials presided over by a military judge and decided by the judge or a panel of officers who weigh the evidence. Convictions are reviewed by the commanding officer, who refers the case for a court-martial, and he/she has discretion to mitigate or set aside convictions or send back for rehearings.
If the commander approves a conviction and sentence, it can be reviewed by an intermediate criminal court for the four main services: Army, Navy-Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard. The loser in the intermediate courts can then appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The U.S. Supreme Court has discretionary review of death penalty and certain certified cases.
Critics of POTUS 45's past pardon and possible future pardons for war crimes -- a criticism coming from many current and former servicemen and women -- is the possible degradation of unit morale and control that such pardons might cause. Who needs to follow the rules of war if the C-in-C will grant me a pardon?
Armies of democracy must not be mere gangs of thugs.
The American cemetery above Omaha Beach is testament to an Army of democracy which defeated a thuggish army led by a thug who tried to make a grave of the world.
Remember to chew on that thought during your cookout this Memorial Day weekend.

Goshay: Rich parents outsmarted themselves for kids who can't make the grade

Texto completo: Celebrities and multimillionaires are going down like bowling pins, all because they couldn't bear the thought of their offspring not being accepted at a top-tier school - or worse, landing at a public school, rubbing elbows with your kid.
What would drive a person to take such risk with their livelihood and reputation?
Because when you're a parent, you'll do almost anything for your child. But in this case, it also was the horror that for all their investment, all the private schooling, tutoring and special privileges, their children still turned out to be ordinary.
They needn't have gone to such lengths. A new study by the Georgetown University finds when it comes to success, being born into an affluent family counts for more than talent. It says, in short, "In America, it is often better to be rich than to be smart."
The report, which tracked a group of children to adulthood since 1989, found seven of 10 low-scoring kindergartners from wealthy families still ended up as wealthy adults. You're as thick as a plank, but your pop's a millionaire? You'll be just fine.
It also found that when a child stumbles academically, wealthy families spend five times more on support and enrichment programs than do working-class and poor families.
In the current college scandal, some entrance-exam "coaches" and proctors were commanding fat fees not to improve students' test scores, but to fix them.
During her court appearance, actress Felicity Huffman confessed she paid a proctor $15,000 to "correct" her eldest daughter's ACT test scores, which increased the result by 400 points.
Such nit-wittery failed take into account that once she got to college, Huffman's daughter wouldn't have been able to maintain the level of performance the score indicated and she likely would have washed out.
This isn't to denigrate people who honestly and genuinely earn their success, but we know we need only to turn on the TV to see a parade of people who wouldn't be where they are had they not won the womb lottery.
Case in point: The New York Times recently reported the president squandered $1 billion over a 10-year period. It takes a special talent to burn through $1 billion. Most people couldn't do it unless they set it directly on fire.
He would have been better off to deposit it in a Christmas Club account at the credit union. As it stands, he holds the distinction of losing more money than any American in history, but his father's wealth ensured he always had a soft place to land.
That same wealth likely paved his way into the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. His grades, however, have remained more secure than the Mueller report. But we know had he made the dean's list, every American with a mailbox would have received a copy of his transcripts by now.
Though the Georgetown report does not underestimate the power of talent and hard work to lift a child out of poverty, it notes that a low-income child with academic promise still has less opportunity, less of a chance at achieving success, than a low-performing wealthy child because of all the factors involving one's socio-economic status.
In short, some rich parents are heading to jail and disgrace for a caper they didn't even have to commit. You'd think they'd be smarter.

Texto completo: We're not even halfway through 2019, and already this has been a banner year for Atlanta authors. Earlier this year, we saw books published by Soniah Kamal ( "Unmarriageable"), Jessica Handler ( "The Magnetic Girl"), Mickey Dubrow ( "American Judas"), Anissa Gray ( "The
Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls"), Snowden Wright ( "American Pop") and Devi S. Laskar ( "The Atlas of Blues and Reds"). And among the AJC's most highly anticipated Southern books this summer, five are by local authors. Running the gamut from contemporary beach reads to thought-provoking investigations of our recent past, here are 10 books we can't wait to read this season.
'Sunset Beach'
If it's summer, there must be a new book out by Mary Kay Andrews, the self-proclaimed queen of beach reads who specializes in stories about women reinventing themselves. Andrews' latest page-turner is about Drue Campbell, a professional kiteboarder who's laid up with a knee injury in a recently inherited beach cottage on the Gulf Coast of Florida. With few other options at her disposal, she begins working for her estranged father, a flashy personal injury lawyer. While on the job, she comes across a cold case involving a murder at a resort hotel and turns amateur sleuth. This seaside murder mystery is less about whodunit and more about who can you trust. (St. Martin's Press, on sale now)
'Orange World and Other Stories'
The third collection of short stories by "Swamplandia!" author Karen Russell is equal parts chilling and comic as mundane aspects of everyday life like motherhood, the opening of a new hotel and a trip to a national forest bump up against a fantastical assortment of boogeymen, including an infectious tree spirit and a man who breeds tornadoes. In the title story "Orange World," previously published in The New Yorker, an anxious new mother strikes a terrifying deal with the devil in order to ensure her child's safety. In "Bog Girl: A Romance," a boy falls in love with the body of a girl he discovers buried in the bog. "She doesn't work, she doesn't help. All day she lazes around the house," complains the boy's mother. Reading these eight tight stories is like seeing one's own private fears and anxieties unleashed to grimly humorous effect. (Penguin Random House, on sale now)
'Sisters and Rebels'
Written by Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, the founding director of the Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina, this deeply researched historical account of a Georgia family's evolution ofenlightenmentwasinspired by stories the author collected in 1973 from her principal subjects, sisters Grace and Katherine Lumpkin. Born in the late 1800s in a prominent slaveholding family to a member of the Ku Klux Klan, the women earned college degrees, moved north and became equal rights advocates for women and blacks, although Grace would have a philosophical reversal in her later years. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly calls it "admirably crafted" and "a fascinating window on America's social and intellectual history." (W.W. Norton, on sale now)
'Grace Will
Lead Us Home'
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jennifer Berry Hawes was preparing for bed on June 17, 2015, when she first learned of Dylann Roof's violent rampage at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Mother Emanuel) in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. That night she wrote the first of many stories she would file for the local newspaper, the Post and Courier, about the massacre that killed nine people and the resulting trial. In "Grace Will Lead Us Home," Hawes focuses on the survivors and the loved ones of those who died as she details the healing process that followed this shattering event that sent shock waves through a city and a nation still grappling with its sordid racial history. (St. Martin's Press, June 4)
'The Favorite Daughter'
Following the success of her historical fiction debut, "Becoming Mrs. Lewis," about the wife of "Narnia" author C.S. Lewis, New York Times best-selling author Patti Callahan Henry returns to form with her latest contemporary women's fiction release, "The Favorite
Daughter," set in the fictitious small
town of Watersend, South Carolina. Lena Donohue is a New York-based travel writer who returns home to tend to her father, who has Alzheimer's. As the family tries to preserve their father's memories through stories and photographs, Lena is forced to confront her own painful memories of her thwarted wedding day. Along the way, she finds a way to forgive those who betrayed her. (Penguin Random House, June 4)
'Smokin' Joe'
Son of Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, who wrote aboutthe MuhammadAliand Joe Frazier rivalry in the book "Ghosts of Manila," Mark Kram Jr. turns his focus to the lesser-known half of that pugnacious duo, Joe Frazier, in his biography "Smokin' Joe."Born in Beaufort, South Carolina, the youngest of 13 children raised in a two-bed-room house, Frazier would go on to win an Olympic gold medal and reign as the heavyweight champion boxer from 1970 to 1973, until he was defeated by George Foreman.He would fight Ali three times, the last time at Thrilla in Manila, considered one of the best boxing matches in sports history. (HarperCollins, June 4)
'The Nickel Boys'
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead, who won the National Book Award for his historical novel "The Underground Railroad," returns with his highly anticipated follow-up, "The Nickel Boys." Set in Tallahassee, Florida, in the early '60s, it follows the trajectory of two young black men who meet in a brutal reform school. Elwood Curtis is an idealistic follower of Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings who is headed to college when he's mistakenly caught up in something that lands him in Nickel Academy.There he meets Turner, a cagey skeptic who's always working the angles. Their experiences in the Nickel and the choices they make will have a resounding impact on their lives. (Doubleday, July 16)
'Never Have I Ever'
No good has ever come from playing the drinking game Never Have I Ever. Nobody knows that better than Amy Whey, a mom and scuba diving instructor. In New York Times best-selling author Joshilyn Jackson's new novel, Amy meets her match in the mysterious and diabolical Angelica Roux, a new addition to the neighborhood book club. When they engage in the game one night, both women reveal more than they intend, and before Amy knows it, the deep, dark secret she's been hiding from everyone is in danger of being revealed. And it could cost her everything she holds dear. (William Morrow, July 30) 'We Are All Good People Here'
Like Whitehead's "The Nickel Boys," Susan Rebecca White's new novel is also set in the early '60s and follows the lives of two people who meet at an educational facility, but the setting and circumstances couldn't be more different. Daniella Gold and Eve Whalen are two privileged young women who meet as freshmen at exclusive Belmont College. They both get caught up in the turbulent times of political unrest, but their attempts to make the world a better place lead them down divergent paths when Eve becomes involved with the radical underground. Spanning 30 years, "We Are All Good People Here"examines how the choices we make in our youth can affect the lives of future generations. (Simon and Schuster, Aug. 6)
'The Last Widow' New York Times best-selling author Karin Slaughter's new thriller brings back popular recurring characters Sara Linton, an Atlanta medical examiner, and Will Trent, an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.Romantically linked, the couple is drawn into the belly of a conspiracy group after a scientist with the CDC is kidnapped and two bombs explode near Emory University. Threatening to destroy thousands of lives, the group responsible for thecity's reign of terror kidnaps Sara, and it's up to Will to save her and thwart their plans. (William Morrow, Aug. 20)

Texto completo: One evening in late March, about 20 activists gathered at a cafe in Dupont Circle to discuss their campaign strategy for an upcoming election, in which thousands of Washington-area residents are eligible to cast ballots. How can we best get out the vote? What happens if a new party enters the race? How do we counter the far right?
It was shaping up to be one of the more important elections of recent years. What election might that be, you ask? Not the one that will decide who controls the Virginia legislature. That's in November. And despite the growing horde of presidential candidates, the Iowa caucuses are not until February. No, the people gathered at the cafe weren't Bernie Bros and they weren't wearing MAGA hats. The voters they were seeking to influence weren't even American, but French.
Ever since a 2008 reform came into effect, French expats have had an intriguing political relationship to their home country. In elections for the French National Assembly, overseas citizens now vote for candidates to represent them where they live. French residents of the United States and Canada, for instance, have a representative in the 577-member assembly - as do French voters in 10 other overseas constituencies.
The day of the meeting in Dupont Circle, a different type of campaign was on the agenda: the election for the European Parliament, set for May 26. French expats do not have specific representatives in the European Parliament; like all French voters, they cast ballots for a party's list, with seats allotted based on how many overall votes the party wins. Still, France's system of representation in the National Assembly gives expats a more relevant stake in their country's politics - and arguably shapes their involvement in all elections.
Everyone in attendance at the meeting was a partisan of La République En Marche (LREM), France's governing party. They sat around a long oval table filled with croissants, cafe au lait and policy documents. There were college students and economists, policy wonks and retirees, some wearing jeans or spring dresses, others still spiffy in their work clothes. They spoke in French about politics and strategy, occasionally lapsing into English.
Béatrice Leydier, a young employee of an international-development NGO, urged the committee to do outreach with families whose children go or went to Rochambeau, the French international school in Bethesda, Md. Laughing, she recalled leafleting before the 2017 presidential and parliamentary elections outside a local French bakery on weekends, where she had gone in hopes of finding French people.
This year's European elections are important for many reasons, some of the LREM supporters told me. In the wake of Brexit and often virulent anti-European Union sentiment across the continent, the key issue, at least symbolically, is the survival of the 28-nation union. "Many far-right nationalist parties in Europe tap into long-standing fears about globalization and a dilution of national identity, and are hostile to immigration, Islam and the E.U. itself," said Kaltoum Maroufi-Colle, an art teacher at Montgomery College.
"We want to improve the E.U., but the nationalists have no vision for Europe and don't believe in the E.U.," Guillaume Deybach, the chief executive of a local insurance company, said as he sipped a glass of red wine.
"We're in a bubble here," cautioned Jeremy Lagelee, a young lawyer who recently moved back to Paris. "President Macron is very popular here." Lagelee recalled finding almost no supporters of the far-right and far-left candidates when he campaigned for LREM in Washington in 2017.
Indeed. Although Emmanuel Macron has been beset with "yellow vest" protesters in recent months, he was a big favorite of the 160,000 French nationals in America, and in Washington especially. He won more than 92 percent of the D.C.-area vote in the second, decisive round of the 2017 election, when his opponent was Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. By contrast, in France, Macron won 66.1 percent.
Alexandre Kleitman, who co-directs LREM's Washington "committee" with Leydier, said they would try to reach the more than 15,000 French voters in the D.C. region mostly through social media and existing networks. (The party has 17 committees working for it in the United States. Other French political parties also have committees, although they are fewer and far less active.) But turning out the vote for European Parliament seats can be tough because that election draws less attention than French parliamentary ones. In 2014, during the last campaign for the European Parliament - where France currently has 74 of 751 seats - turnout among French voters in the United States was only about 10 percent. Compare that to the 2017 presidential election, when voter turnout among U.S.-based French nationals was 44 percent, according to France-Amérique, a magazine published by the French Embassy.
Laurence Sage, a retired World Bank employee living near Friendship Heights, likes France's post-2008 practice of electing overseas representatives to the National Assembly. "We need a representative who is conscious of matters that concern those of us with a foot in both continents," Sage explained. Nabil Bessaha, a 45-year-old in North Bethesda who has spent most of his working life in D.C., added, "We want to make sure that France doesn't treat us like second-class citizens."
"French living abroad have different issues from those living in France," Roland Lescure, the representative for the United States and Canada in the French National Assembly, told me from Paris. "They're concerned about things like what benefits can they qualify for, funding for overseas French schools, and moving in and out of the country."
Lescure, 52, was just another French expat when he was elected in 2017. He now represents one of the world's geographically largest political constituencies, stretching from Puerto Rico to Yukon. A financier in Montreal whose parents had been Communists, he had never been a politician, but like many LREM candidates, he was seduced by Macron's potential to alter the French political landscape. "French politics needed a change," he said. "The usual suspects had been around too long, and many of us wanted to break the old left-right divide."
Lescure not only represents his U.S. and Canadian constituents but also chairs a parliamentary economic-affairs committee, focusing on making France more competitive and business-friendly. "It's a pretty fast pace," he said of his job. "I make about 15 trips a year" to Washington and elsewhere in North America.
Back in Dupont Circle, Deybach slyly reflected on the benefits of being a Frenchman voting in Washington. Because overseas French are exempt from most French taxes if they spend more than six months of the year outside of France, he said: "Unlike D.C. residents, who have taxation without representation, we have representation without taxation."

Texto completo: Taiwan last week became first in Asia to recognize same-sex unions, in what is considered a landmark achievement for LGTBQ rights. On Friday, the first couples began tying the knot at Taipei's Shinyi District Household Registration office.
Hundreds of same-sex couples exchanged vows, according to Time magazine. Throngs of reporters with cameras filled the office, alongside couples dressed to wed, as the unions were made legal.
The legislature of the island near the Chinese mainland voted last week, 66 to 27, to recognize the marriages, beating a two-year deadline established by Taiwan's high court on May 24, 2017. The court ruled then, Nick Aspinwall wrote in The Washington Post, that barring same-sex couples from marrying violated the Taiwanese constitution.
Conservative opposition followed, and Taiwanese voters in a November 2018 public referendum chose not to extend full rights to same-sex couples. But the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) helped pass legislation that provides same-sex couples with child custody, tax and insurance benefits.
On Friday, couples basked in the glow of matrimony.
"Taiwan's gay people have gone through a tough path, Shane Lin, who married Marc Yuan, said during a post-wedding news conference, according to Inkstone News, which transcribed a video from ETtoday. "Today I can openly tell everyone, in front of so many people, that we are getting married and we are gay.
The news resonated across the world.
Ellen DeGeneres, a television show host and one of the most prominent gay people in the United States, shared her reaction on Twitter, saying: "Taiwan is now the first Asian country to allow marriage equality. Let's celebrate every step in the right direction.
To some, it was but a step. A 2017 map from foreignpolicy.com shows same-sex unions legal across North America, and in many countries in South America and Europe, and almost none in Africa or Asia.
Thailand has proposed a law to recognize civil partnerships, but same-sex unions remain illegal elsewhere in Asia, Aspinwall wrote. And in Africa on Friday, Kenya's high court upheld a law that makes same-sex relations a crime, Bloomberg News reported.
Chi Chia-wei, a gay rights activist in Taiwan for more than 30 years, told the New York Times, "Progress is good. More progress is even better.

Texto completo: As I read and hear points regarding the just-signed "heartbeat" bill, I've noticed that seemingly all sides have missed something significant. For decades, those seeking to outlaw abortion have insisted, rather adamantly, that life begins at conception. This view, to take just one example, has been the basis for opposition to the so-called "morning after" pill. Since they are now emphasizing when a heartbeat can be detected, have those who pushed this bill changed their views about when they think a living person is really present in a women's uterus? Are they now saying the destruction of a zygote is not really murder? More likely, it seems to me they are acknowledging (however subtly) what many of us have been saying all along - that the issue of when life begins is not open and shut. This, I think, is reason enough for why it should largely remain a private matter.
SANJAY LAL, STOCKBRIDGE
What a joy not to be a New York Times subscriber. Suffering the Times' Charles M. Blow column, "White privilege won't give up easily" (Opinion, May 19), was painful enough. A similar editorial about Barack Obama would have been labeled "racist," but Blow is confident striking out against "the white male racist patriarchy" because no level or manner of degradation ascribed to whites can be considered racist. Blow notes a majority of white men (62%) voted for Donald Trump, as did a plurality of white women (47%). Blow's "in-depth analysis": Racists. Virtually every black voter voted for Barack Obama, so ... super racists? No, that's just more white supremacy logic. Blow and other progressive blowhards constantly try to equate conservatism with racism because defeating conservative ideas takes way too much thought.

PAID FAMILY LEAVE GAINS MOMENTUM: A new Senate bipartisan working group will study paid family leave, a priority that has been nudged along by senior White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump.
Teaming up to lead the working group are Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., a duo that recently worked together to introduce legislation aimed at ending surprise medical bills that many patients receive after going to the emergency room.
What they’ll study: Plans states have enacted, how to make paid family leave more widely available, what types of benefits or eligibility criteria they could look at, and how to fund a new paid leave policy.
Who’s in the working group: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, announced its formation on Wednesday. It will include Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Bob Casey, D-Pa., Todd Young, R-Ind., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.
Other discussions are under way. Ivanka Trump, who encouraged the Finance Committee to set up the working group, met this morning to discuss paid family leave with Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Susan Collins, R-Maine, Martha McSally, R-Ariz., Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., according to the White House. Cassidy is also still working with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Nev., to craft bipartisan legislation, his office confirmed.
Democrats have united behind a bill that would add a payroll tax to fund family and sick leave, while two pairs of Senate Republicans have introduced their own approaches letting new parents take Social Security early in exchange for delaying retirement. All of these have House companions.
The Senate Finance Committee said all of the bills that have been introduced would be considered by the working group, and the parties will work to resolve their differences.

STUDY: HEALTHCARE COSTS CONSUMING LARGE CHUNK OF INCOME: An estimated 23.6 million people with employer coverage spent 10% or more of their income on premiums, out-of-pocket costs, or both, from 2016-17, according to a study out Wednesday by the Commonwealth Fund.
‘SINGLE PAYER’ HEARING HIGHLIGHTS DIFFERENCES AMONG DEMOCRATS: A hearing Wednesday intended to focus on legislating a fully government-financed healthcare system exposed the differences Democrats have on healthcare. While Democrats continued to focus their ire on Republicans for working to undo Obamacare, several lawmakers took their allotted time of questioning to highlight alternatives they supported, whether the Medicare for America Act or the public option.
BILL BLOCKING SHORT-TERM PLANS FAILS UNDER GOP OPPOSITION: Republicans blocked a bill Wednesday from Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Doug Jones, D-Ala., that would have overturned the Trump administration’s extension of short-term health insurance plans. Democrats attempted to pass the bill, the No Junk Plans Act, by unanimous consent. It passed the House last week largely along party lines.
CMS OPEN TO ACCEPT REQUESTS FROM STATES FOR PARTIAL MEDICAID EXPANSION: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma said Wednesday that the agency is open to receiving more requests from states to enact partial expansions of Medicaid, which would cover people up to 100% of the federal poverty line, rather than covering those up to 138% of the poverty line as contemplated under the Affordable Care Act’s provisions. Arkansas and Massachusetts have submitted waivers to CMS asking to enact this expansion plan, and the agency approved such a measure in Utah.
Verma reiterates opposition to Medicare drug negotiation: In Wednesday’s press event, Verma told reporters she remains opposed to direct price negotiating between the government and drug companies. Verma said that if the government becomes responsible for negotiating prices and thus creating formularies for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, some approved drugs that work for certain individuals may be excluded from the approved formularies. “It’s my job to protect and secure the Medicare program,” Verma said. “When I see policies that could harm the program, it’s my duty to speak out about that.”
DCCC CANCELS LIPINSKI FUNDRAISER: The Democratic Congressional Campaign canceled a planned fundraiser for Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., a staunch opponent of abortion rights.. Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., head of the DCCC, announced Wednesday that she would pull out of the fundraiser, citing the multiplelegislative efforts to curtail access to abortions throughout several states. “I’m proud to have a 100 percent pro-choice voting record and I’m deeply alarmed by the rapidly escalating attacks on women’s access to reproductive care in several states,” Bustos said in a statement.
SCHUMER: ‘WE ARE PUTTING THE HEAT’ ON GOP OVER ROE: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that he and his Democratic colleagues will highlight GOP hostility to Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide, as part of the Democratic strategy to gain the upper hand on the politics of abortion. Republican state legislators have had success in passing stringent bans on abortions in recent weeks. Roe, however, remains relatively popular. Schumer suggested that it would be easier to force Republicans to declare a stance on the Supreme Court ruling than it would be to nail them down on the state abortion laws like the one in Alabama.
FAMILIES USA JOINS EFFORT TO REPEAL THE CADILLAC TAX: More groups are joining the effort to have Congress repeal the “Cadillac tax” on health insurance plans in Obamacare, including one of the law’s main supporters and defenders, Families USA. Also joining are Public Sector HealthCare Roundtable, the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, and the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.
The tax is a 40% tax on high-cost health insurance that was initially created to go after what had once been considered generous health insurance. Now, plans that cover middle-income people would fall into that bracket because the cost of healthcare has continued to climb. That reality has led several advocates to press Congress to do away with the tax.
ACLU SUES VERMONT FOR WITHHOLDING HEPATITIS C MEDICATION FROM PRISONERS: The ACLU of Vermont and the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School filed a class action suit Tuesday against Vermont for refusing to provide medication for hundreds of prisoners who have hepatitis C. The suit was filed in the federal district court on behalf of two Vermont prisoners, Richard West and Joseph Bruyette, who will represent inmates who have been or will be denied treatment for hepatitis C.
PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS DEMAND SOCIAL MEDIA END ALL TOBACCO ADS: The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids has joined more than 125 international public health organizations to demand that Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat immediately end promotions for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.

Joe's St. Louis: St. Louis teen's political punditry worthy of a 'New Yorker' piece

Texto completo: CAMPAIGN FUN -- Gabe Fleisher had already been covered by the New York Times and Washington Post. So what was left but a feature in the New Yorker?
The 17-year-old junior at John Burroughs School -- already noted as a teen political wunderkind for his "Wake Up To Politics" blog -- is the focus of a New Yorker piece published Monday online:
"The Teen Who Thwarted Bill de Blasio's Presidential Announcement"
"It's been very exciting, all the coverage since I broke the de Blasio thing," Fleisher said in an interview with the Post-Dispatch Wednesday.
The New Yorker article tells how Fleisher's dogged pursuit of political news to fill his blog led him to an errant Facebook item posted May 15 by a county Democratic committee in Iowa, saying de Blasio would kick off his presidential-bid road trip on Friday in Sioux City.
When Fleisher tried to contact the committee, the event posting was pulled off Facebook -- but not before Fleisher had made a screenshot and then posted it to Twitter, the article said.
Fleisher's scoop allowed protesters -- an unlikely combination of NYC police and "Black Lives Matter" activists -- to gather early May 16 outside of the "Good Morning America" studios, where de Blasio had planned to make his announcement before heading to Iowa.
"I don't think my tweet will change the trajectory of de Blasio's campaign," Fleisher said in the article, "but it fits very neatly into the narrative that this campaign is not destined to go very far."
The son of Rabbi Randy and Alana Fleisher of University City, his biggest previous publicity pop was in May 2017, when the New York Times wrote "Homework? First I Need to Get to the Bottom of This Comey Story."
In 2015, the Washington Post reported on him. The Post-Dispatch also has written about him, in 2012 and then in 2016.
So, what's next? "I haven't really started thinking about colleges," Fleisher said. "But I do see myself continuing in journalism, because covering politics is what I love to do."
DARN KIDS -- Marquette High School junior Nikhil Boddu won big before coming home from the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.
Big, as in a full ride to Drexel University.
Last week in Phoenix, Nikhil, 16, was awarded Intel's certificate for computer science excellence, which brings a four-year, full-tuition scholarship worth $200,000 to the university.
His project researched ways to reduce unstructured noise in MRIs to improve the diagnosis of neuro-degenerative diseases.
"It was a pleasant surprise," Nikhil said. "I'd put a lot of work into this project for the last two years."
Being only a junior, Nikhil said he has yet to apply to colleges. "But (Drexel) is now on my list."
The son of Vamsi and Radhika Boddu of Ballwin, Nikhil was one of two STL students sent to the fair by the Academy of Science St. Louis.
Cindy Wang, a junior at Ladue Horton Watkins High, attended with her molecular biology project on reducing tumors.
HAMM TIME -- That was one lucky suit STL No. 1 celeb Jon Hamm wore Monday night on the "Jimmy Kimmel Show."
Donning a blue suit and shirt, Hamm freely admitted he dressed that way to cheer the St. Louis Blues onto victory over the San Jose Sharks. (For those out of the universe recently, the Blues won and are headed to the Stanley Cup Finals.)
"When I support a team, I go all the way," he proclaimed to pal Kimmel, who has tried Imo's Pizza (hated it) and Ted Drewes frozen custard (loved it) when Hamm brought them to previous shows.
Hamm told Kimmel about being at Game 7 of the Blues-Dallas Stars series. "I literally moved things around in my schedule .. . because I was like, 'I gotta go back.'"
Making the Stanley Cup final, Hamm said, would be "huge."
"That would be the first time they will have made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in my lifetime," he said. "I was negative 1 ... the last time they made it: 1970."

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – Jim James has spent the better part of almost two decades as the lead singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist of My Morning Jacket. With an illustrious solo career of his own, James' Uniform Distortion tour will celebrate his 2018 record of the same name and include other career-spanning material.
CAPA presents Jim James at the Southern Theatre (21 E. Main St.) on Friday, June 14, at 8 p.m. Tickets are $41.50-$51 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at 614-469-0939 or 800-982-2787.
With seven studio albums, My Morning Jacket has grown into one of the most acclaimed rock and roll bands in the world. The New York Times heralded the band as, "...the new kings of expand-your-mind, religious-experience rock..." Their last three albums – Evil Urges (2018), Circuital (2011), and The Waterfall (2015) – each received Grammy nominations for Best Alternative Album with The Waterfall debuting at number 5 on the Billboard 200 chart. Alongside the band's recording and touring, James has maintained a steady, bordering on voracious, flow of work.
In 2013, James released his debut solo record, Regions of Light and Sound of God. He wrote, produced, and played all instruments himself (except for strings and some percussion) for the record which was inspired by life and the 1929 novel (written in woodcuts) God's Man by Lynd Ward. It was named one of the best albums of the year by PASTE, MTV, and FUSE and was "the year's first great record" (GQ). A performance of track "A New Life" on "Late Night" earned high praise from the now-"Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon,"...to this day, my favorite musical performance was 'A New Life' on 'Late Night' ...He [Jim James] is fantastic. I love him."
In 2016, James released the politically charged solo record, Eternally Even. Rolling Stone described it as, "nine flamboyantly spiritual songs wrapped in creamy electronics and set to funk and hip hop beats...an eccentric, gently compelling pleasure. [Jim James] renders his change gospel with conversational grace, Bill Withers warmth, Sly Stone optimism and Neil Young conviction." The album's release saw him embark on a national tour with appearances on "The Tonight Show," "The Late, Late Show with James Corden," and a debut at #1 on the Billboard Alternative chart. The album topped many year-end best lists with NPR praising the record's "arresting, soulful ... transcendent tunes."
James released his third solo album, Uniform Distortion (2019) was received with immediate acclaim. "A giddily powerful response to these troubled times," hailed the Guardian in its four-star review. "His mix of musical joie de vivre and lyrical home truths prove fiendishly effective." The Washington Post said, "With driving guitar riffs and catchy hooks combined with his signature soaring vocals, James delivers an utterly engaging, hard-charging, straight-ahead record that almost feels like a throwback to a different era while also being very much current." American Songwriter claimed, ""There are enough artistic twists and turns to please even the most dedicated Jacket fan, showing that James remains as musically edgy as ever on an album that pulses with energy, enthusiasm, and the restless spirit James has always personified." Four months after Uniform Distortion was released, James followed with the companion record of Uniform Clarity comprising acoustic renditions of the songs in a more stripped down and honest response to what went before.
James has continued expanding on his zealous lists of credits, lending his voice to albums by the likes of the Roots, David Lynch, Brandi Carlile, and John Fogerty, and partnering with other artists on numerous side projects such as New Multitudes, Monsters of Folk, and T-Bone Burnett's The New Basement Tapes.
Known for his live performances, James has found himself in the touring company of those like Neil Young, Pearl Jam, and Bob Dylan, even appearing in the Dylan-inspired film, I'm Not There. My Morning Jacket supported Roger Waters as his surprise backing band during the famed 2015 Newport Folk Festival. He has embedded himself in the world of film and television, be it through the use of his music in various projects or his long-running relationships with those in the field. He has also established himself as a producer in his own right, producing records by Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Dean Wareham, Basia Bulat, Amo Amo, and Ray Lamontagne. In 2016, he collaborated with NASA for the launch of their Juno Mission and the Sundance Film Festival for their Freedom of Expression event.
In 2018, James embarked on a successful, intimate, career-spanning solo acoustic tour, which saw him play sold out dates through historic theatres and performing arts centers across the US. In the 2019 Uniform Distortion tour, James will play the complete record with a full band for the first time nationally.

Harry Potter film concert series continues COLUMBUS – The Harry Potter Film Concert Series returns to Ohio Theatre with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in Concert, the fourth film in the Harry Potter series. On Jan. 18, 2020 the Columbus Symphony will perform the magical score live from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire while the entire film plays in high-definition on a 40-foot screen.

State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at 614-469-0939 or 800-982-2787.
In 2016, CineConcerts and Warner Bros. Consumer Products announced the Harry Potter Film Concert Series, a global concert tour celebrating the Harry Potter films. Since the world premiere of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in Concert in June 2016, more than 1.3 million fans have enjoyed this magical experience from J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World, which is scheduled to include more than 900 performances across more than 48 countries worldwide through 2019.
In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter is mysteriously entered into the Triwizard Tournament, a grueling contest among three wizarding schools in which he confronts a dragon, water demons, and an enchanted maze only to find himself in Lord Voldemort's grasp. All will change when Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave childhood forever and face challenges beyond their imagining.
Winning both the International Film Music Critics Award (IFMCA) and ASCAP Film and Television Music Award for the score, the rich tapestry of music composed by Patrick Doyle (Brave, Hamlet, Sense and Sensibility) brought fresh emotional gravitas with darker melodic undercurrents as Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione face these new adventures.
Justin Freer, president of CineConcerts and producer/conductor of the Harry Potter Film Concert Series explains, "The Harry Potter film series is a once-in-a-lifetime cultural phenomenon that continues to delight millions of fans around the world. It is with great pleasure that we bring fans for the first time ever an opportunity to experience the award-winning music scores played live by a symphony orchestra, all while the beloved film is simultaneously projected onto the big screen. This is truly an unforgettable event."
Brady Beaubien of CineConcerts and concert producer for the Harry Potter Film Concert Series added, "Harry Potter is synonymous with excitement around the world and we hope that by performing this incredible music with the full movie, audiences will enjoy returning to the Wizarding World."
Tickets are on sale now.

AMERICA IS WAKING UP TO ITS INCOME TAX INEQUITIES; PLAIN TALK

Texto completo: Could it be that we're starting to wake up to the inequities in our income tax laws?
The Donald Trump "tax reform" law passed in December 2017 was supposed to eliminate the unfairness that had become so commonplace in recent years. Ordinary Americans can't escape paying taxes, but wealthy individuals and mega-corporations get by with paying little or nothing.
The 2017 law dramatically lowered the corporate tax rate, but we were promised in return that the lower rates would end the practice of stashing money overseas, and companies would now at least pay their share of U.S. taxes albeit it at a lower rate. Something is better than nothing, we were told.
It's now apparent, however, that the new law has made things worse when it comes to the U.S. collecting corporate taxes.
According to recent accounting, the list of those paying zero roughly doubled during the first full year of Trump's new law, which not only lowered the tax rate from 35 to 21 percent, but actually expanded the loopholes which allowed them to escape taxes all together. In fact, several not only didn't pay taxes on multi-billion-dollar profits, but also received rebates.
Leading this category was the hugely successful Amazon, now the country's largest retailer. Amazon reported profits of $10 billion in 2018, paid no federal taxes, plus collected a small rebate.
Filling out the top five list of tax avoiders were Delta Air Lines with $5 billion in profits, Chevron, General Motors and EOG Resources, all of which made between $4 billion and $5 billion during the 2018 tax year.
The claims that the "tax reform" would convince corporations to bring back the profits they had stored in low-tax countries haven't worked out nearly as well as hoped, either. Much of that off-shore money was supposed to go to workers' wages and benefits, but a significant portion has been used to buy back corporate stock from shareholders.
So it's no wonder that the U.S. Treasury has experienced a significant drop in revenues and the national debt is skyrocketing, all the while the nation's economy is booming. Some economists shudder to think what this means to the economic health of the country in years down the road.
The New York Times reported last week that the continued tax inequity issue is beginning to resonate with many working people, especially since the large field of Democratic candidates is beginning to include the issue, along with health care and immigration, in appearances around the country.
General Motors is a favorite target. While workers are losing jobs thanks to the corporation's decision to close several plants, GM paid zero taxes on $4.32 billion in income.
"What was promised to these people were more jobs," said the president of the United Auto Workers union at beleaguered Lordstown, Ohio, where the city has been devastated by GM's closing of the plant that made the Chevy Cruze.
"When you give them a tax break and they take the jobs away, that's like a double whammy. That's a lose-lose," David Green told the Times.
Meanwhile, the Times' story pointed out, Democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have offered versions of corporate tax reform they would push if elected.
Warren, for instance, wants a new system that would tax corporations 7 percent on every dollar over $100 million in profits they earn anywhere in the world. She says that under her plan, Amazon would have paid $698 million in taxes last year rather than getting by with nothing.
Sanders, of course, has long pushed for a new way to capture corporate taxes, including on money stashed overseas. Klobuchar would hike Trump's 21 percent back to 25 percent and use the extra revenue to help pay for bridges, roads and airports that are sorely in need of updating.
What more and more citizens are beginning to realize is that allowing corporate America to escape paying taxes to help pay for the government services they routinely receive is not a sustainable plan. Individual taxpayers can't be expected to carry the load, nor can future generations shoulder an ever-increasing national debt.
But they can't expect a different result if they pick a president who only a few days ago admitted to escaping taxes for several years while losing a billion dollars, but described it all as a "sport."

Texto completo: Dear Carrie: I'm collegebound and beginning to look at financing options. Given the sometimes alarming headlines about student-debt levels, should I be worried about overextending myself? -- A Reader
Dear Reader: The headlines are indeed alarming:
-- "The Student Loan Debt Crisis Is About to Get Worse" (Bloomberg).
-- "Student Loan Debt Statistics in 2018: A $1.5 Trillion Crisis" (Forbes).
-- "The Student Debt Problem Is Worse Than We Imagined" (The New York Times).
However, student debt doesn't have to be overwhelming. In fact, when used responsibly, it can lead to a more secure future.
That's because debt often fits into one of two categories: bad or good.
Borrowing at a high interest rate to buy a depreciating asset -- like using credit cards to pay for clothing or other consumer goods -- is the kind of bad debt that can undermine your financial stability.
Borrowing at a reasonable rate to buy an asset with the potential to appreciate, on the other hand -- like securing a mortgage to purchase a first home -- is the kind of good debt that can actually pave the way for a better future.
So which camp does student debt fit into? Potentially either, depending on the amount of debt, the terms of the debt and your ability to pay it back. Let's take a look at how you can manage student debt so it works in your favor.
Consider Your Future Income
The first rule of any financial transaction is to go in with your eyes open. When you're contemplating a student loan, think carefully about your future earnings prospects.
Although personal circumstances vary, one useful rule of thumb is to limit your total loan balance to no more than the amount you will reasonably earn in your first year on the job. If you're planning a career in social work, for example, this might mean borrowing no more than $50,000, whereas a doctor might justify as much as $200,000.
Better yet, do the math not just for the first year but for the entire life of the loan to better understand how much you'll be paying each month -- and for how long. There are a variety of student loan calculators available online, including the U.S. Department of Education's repayment estimator.
Minimize Your Loans
Besides attending an in-state public university, which is much less expensive, on average, than an out-of-state or private university, there are several other ways to keep a lid on your debt:
-- Graduate in four years: Although obvious, it still bears pointing out that a five-year plan costs 25% more than a four-year plan.
-- Hunt for scholarships: Online resources such as fastweb.com and petersons.com can help you beat the bushes, surfacing even obscure sources of funding.
-- Look for no-loan schools: If you have a stellar academic record and your family is of moderate means, consider colleges that offer "no-loan" financial aid packages, which are meant to significantly reduce or even eliminate the need for student loans. These are generally offered by the top schools in the country, including Harvard and Stanford (both of which cover most costs for families earning less than $65,000). It may not be a free ride, but it can constitute substantial savings.
-- Maximize federal funding: If you do have to borrow, use federal loans first. They generally offer lower interest rates than private loans and often offer better repayment terms.
-- Start at a community college: Sometimes referred to as a 2+2 program, this strategy involves attending a community college for two years and then transferring to a college or university for another two years, which can help cut costs considerably.
Manage Your Debt Wisely
Some 69% of 2018 graduates had student loan debt, owing $29,800 each, on average. No matter how big your student loan burden, however, here are four steps you can take to manage or even reduce it.
1. Automate your payments: If you sign up for automatic loan payments, you may qualify for a reduced interest rate. Be sure not to miss a payment due to, say, insufficient funds, however, lest the benefit disappear.
2. Plan your payments: As soon as you graduate, make a list of all of your loans and monthly payment amounts and then factor them into your post-college budget. Most loans have a six-month grace period before payments begin, but if you have a job lined up and are able to start sooner, consider doing so. Conversely, if your federal-loan payment seems unmanageable relative to your income, look into lower-payment options such as a revised pay as you earn program, which generally limits your payments to 10% of your discretionary income, or income-based repayment, which caps payments based on family size and income.
3. Save on taxes: If you make less than $85,000 ($170,000 for married couples) in 2019, you can deduct up to $2,500 of student loan interest from your taxable income, even if you don't itemize.
4. Tap your employer: If you're still looking for a job, consider one of the many companies that now offer student loan repayment assistance. Note, however, that any such assistance will count as taxable compensation.
There's an ongoing debate about whether higher education is worth the cost. To me, that's a closed subject, not only because studies have shown college graduates earn more than those who don't get a degree, but also because the value of your education goes beyond the expenses incurred. Whether you pursue a degree in engineering or literature, you're broadening yourself in unquantifiable ways. Just don't break your personal bank to do it.

U.S. Considering Expanding Blacklist of Chinese Companies; Lawmakers have already urged Trump administration to consider sanctions on two Chinese makers of video surveillance equipment

Texto completo: The U.S. is considering expanding the list of Chinese companies on a blacklist for U.S. suppliers amid escalating tensions between the two economic powers, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Commerce Department is reviewing whether other Chinese firms should join Huawei Technologies Co. on its so-called entity list, this person said. Once a firm is added to that list, U.S. companies are restricted from doing business with it without obtaining a license—a sanction that can shut out foreign firms from doing business with U.S. suppliers.
No decision has been made and officials may decide not to move forward with further additions to the list, this person said.
Members of Congress have already urged the Trump administration to consider sanctions on two Chinese companies: Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology Co. Both firms make video surveillance equipment. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and others have written to administration officials twice in recent months accusing those firms of profiting from the expansion of government surveillance in China, particularly to target Uighur Muslims.
Hikvision and Dahua didn't respond to requests for comment Wednesday. A Commerce Department spokeswoman said the agency couldn't comment on reviews of specific firms.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a Sept. 25, 2018, letter to Mr. Rubio that the department was looking at Chinese entities as part of "steps to prevent the export of items" that "would enable China's pervasive surveillance and internment system targeting" Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities.
In response to questions about a possible Hikvision blacklisting, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman on Wednesday said: "Recently we have made clear our positions repeatedly on the U.S. using national powers to smear and oppress certain Chinese companies. We firmly oppose that and our position is consistent and clear."
Hikvision has hired Pierre-Richard Prosper, a partner at Arent Fox LLP and former U.S. ambassador-at-large, to review how human rights concerns are evaluated as the company makes business decisions, Mr. Prosper confirmed. He declined to discuss the findings of the continuing review.
Shares of Hikvision dropped 5.5% on China's Shenzhen exchange Wednesday following a New York Times report of the possible blacklisting. About 30% of Hikvision's revenue comes from overseas , though only about 8% from the U.S., according to FactSet.
Huawei was added to the Commerce Department's "entity list" last week, with officials citing national security concerns. The department has since made temporary exceptions .
Hikvision is the world's largest maker of surveillance cameras and is 42% owned by the Chinese government via two state-backed entities. In 2017, a Wall Street Journal report documenting the company's rise and its prevalence in the U.S. led a U.S. military base to remove cameras made by the company and prompted a congressional hearing.
For Hikvision, it isn't clear that the loss of access to American suppliers would deal a devastating blow. The company is a heavy user of chips designed by China's HiSilicon, a unit of Huawei Technologies Co.
However, the company does stand to lose access to more sophisticated machine-learning chips , like those made by Nvidia Corp., the Silicon Valley maker of graphics processing units, said Rex Wu, technology analyst at investment bank Jefferies. Such chips are required for more advanced surveillance techniques drawing on artificial intelligence, such as facial recognition technology, experts have said.

Throwing maximum pressure at Iran

Texto completo: Sometimes it's important to write a column about something you're pretty sure isn't going to happen. In this case, that thing is war with Iran, which Donald Trump clearly doesn't want, and which he will therefore probably avoid. But since the president's current foreign policy is making war more likely, it's still worth saying clearly that it would be a terrible idea for the United States to enter into a serious armed conflict with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In the past I have argued that there is a certain coherence to the Trump foreign policy, even if it's just an accidental synthesis of a chaotic White House's competing impulses. According to that synthesis, recent American presidents have been overly optimistic about democratic transformation, embracing naively utopian hopes in the Islamic world and naively accommodating the rise of China. So what is needed instead is a retrenchment in the greater Middle East, an abandonment of occupations and nation-building efforts and a return to kill-your-enemies, back-your-friends realpolitik, which in turn will make it easier for the United States to pivot to a more confrontational approach with Beijing.
In practice, this retrenchment has included backing out (or trying to) from the Bush-era military commitment to Afghanistan and jettisoning the Obama-era effort to woo Iran into détente. Spun in realpolitik terms, the Trump White House's hard line toward Tehran reflects a belief that the mullahs' enmity is an ineradicable fact, that deals with them in one area inevitably just enable aggression elsewhere, and that it's better to just back our Sunni and Israeli allies rather than reaching for an unlikely realignment and just reaping more mischief in return.
But the (arguable) coherence of this approach has been breaking down as the Trump administration has moved into its "maximum pressure" phase of sanctions against Tehran. Because if you impose maximum pressure on a regional power you are, by definition, no longer trying to maintain a Middle Eastern status quo while pivoting to Asia. Instead, you're effectively returning to the last two administrations' more dramatic Middle East ambitions: You are assuming either that some great diplomatic coup awaits (so Barack Obama was right to seek détente, just wrong to settle) or that your pressure will lead to regime change and democratization (so George W. Bush was right about the freedom agenda after all).
I suspect that Trump is making the first assumption, imagining all this pressure as a prelude to a dramatic deal, while John Bolton and Mike Pompeo are making the second one, imagining the Iranian regime suddenly buckling like the Soviet Union in 1991.
But whatever the core assumption, the maximalist approach inevitably increases the risk of war. If the White House is wrong about the Iranian regime's willingness to make more concessions, then they're turning a dial that can produce only two policy responses: endurance or armed reaction. And if they're right that regime change is a possibility, then the regime they're trying to change will become more likely to lash out the closer it gets to its own breaking point.
Either way, there is nothing about the current situation in the Middle East, or globally, that makes the chance of war with Iran worth taking - as hawks as well as doves concede.
For instance: National Review's David French, generally far more hawkish than I am, describes a potential conflict with Iran as possibly worse than any of our wars since 9/11, and a terrible idea "absent the most serious, urgent and compelling need." David Frum, once a notable Iraq War supporter, writes that war with Iran would recapitulate our Iraq blunders on "a much bigger scale, without allies, without justification, and without any plan at all for what comes next."
There is no explicitly pro-war rejoinder to these points; there's only the sort of half-hawkish argument offered by Eli Lake of Bloomberg, who writes that of course nobody wants war, and the recent flurry of U.S. moves is just all about establishing deterrence.
But even Lake acknowledges that "this strategy is fraught," and "as tensions rise, so does the risk of miscalculation." Which brings us back to the question of whether the larger context in which tensions are rising - the broad "maximum pressure" approach by the U.S. - makes clear strategic sense.
I think that it does not. The United States can treat Iran as an enemy without going all in for brinkmanship; it can leave the nuclear deal without taking steps that make a conventional war more immediately likely.
Trump's 2016 campaign rhetoric made a case against a hawkish Republican foreign policy consensus that seemingly wanted to confront all our enemies, at once, everywhere. The president is now in the middle of a trade war with China that by his own logic is far more important to long-term U.S. interests than some immediate breakthrough or regime breakdown in Tehran. So he should return to that campaign-season wisdom, and to the maxim it suggested: Whenever possible, one war a time.

Global Investors Get Burned on Their Favorite Chinese Surveillance Stock; Would-be buyers of innovative Chinese technology companies have been too complacent about the risk of getting trapped between Beijing and Washington

Texto completo: Huawei may be privately owned, but global investors still risk getting caught up in the unfolding Sino-American spy thriller through other Chinese companies.
Shares in Chinese video-surveillance company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, a darling of Western investors, dropped 5.5% Wednesday on reports that the company could be blacklisted by the U.S. government. The slump should be a reminder that even as access to Chinese stocks expands, investing in much of the country's technology sector bears the risk of getting sandwiched between the security policies of Washington and Beijing.
The Trump administration is considering placing limits on the company's ability to buy U.S. technology, according to a New York Times report. Telecommunications company Huawei, which is unlisted, was the subject of a blacklisting order last week. More than 30% of Hikvision's revenue comes from abroad according to FactSet data, including around 8% from the U.S. A spokesman for Hikvision said it takes the U.S. government's concerns very seriously and has been engaging with the administration since last October.
Hikvision has been the subject of questions over both alleged vulnerabilities that would make its cameras exploitable by hackers and its role in China's suppression of Muslims in Xinjiang. The Chinese government is the company's controlling shareholder, with just under half of outstanding shares.
But it is also the Shenzhen-listed stock with the 11th-highest percent ownership through the Stock Connect system, which allows global investors to access mainland Chinese markets through the Hong Kong bourse. Investors have turned a blind eye to the stock's controversies in their pursuit of well-run Chinese companies working at the technological frontier. Another Shenzhen-listed video-surveillance stock popular with Western investors, Zhejiang Dahua Technology, would also be an obvious target for the U.S. government.
As recently as seven weeks ago, the stock was up by more than 40% for the year, running ahead of the broader Chinese market. Wednesday's fall reduced that annual increase to practically nothing.
Even if the trade spat between the U.S. and China is resolved amicably and recently instituted tariffs rolled back, security-related complaints can't be so easily withdrawn.
The fact that such an obvious target for the Trump administration gained so much international popularity suggests some investors have been far too complacent about the threats to China's tech sector.

Texto completo: Brian Blackstone reports in the Journal that a remarkable government effort to conjure prosperity by distorting credit markets still isn't working:
For five years, European nations have been trying to jump-start their ailing economies with what was supposed to be a radical, short-term remedy—negative interest rates.
It certainly was radical. In August of 2016, your humble correspondent observed :
Politicians playing by their own rules is an old story. But it should count as news that politicians have lately been rewriting a rule in place since 3,000 B.C.
This rule of history is that savers deserve to be compensated when they loan money. Not anymore. In much of the developed world lenders are the ones paying for the privilege of letting governments borrow their cash. Through the magic of modern central banking, countries in Europe and elsewhere have managed to drive their borrowing rates not just to historic lows but all the way into negative territory...
Paul Singer, founder of hedge fund Elliott Management, isn't expecting a happy ending. He believes that because of massive entitlement promises plus huge debt, "the entire developed world is insolvent." He says that a negative rate on a government bond is "crazier than zero, and zero was crazy enough."
Fast forward to today and the Journal's Mr. Blackstone ticks off the ways in which the policy has managed to punish thrift and reward failure as European economies stagnate:
The negative-rate policy's ineffectualness is a sign of just how weak Europe's economic engines are, and how vulnerable. The policy threatens pensions, creates the risk of real-estate bubbles and doesn't fully quell the specter of deflation. European banks struggle with weak interest income and thin margins on loans, putting them behind American peers in profitability and making it harder for them to finance the economy... Profitless companies stay afloat, steering resources away from more efficient ones and weighing on productivity. Central banks' inability to raise rates leaves them with little ammunition to cushion the next downturn with the conventional tool of interest-rate reductions.
By now you may have guessed that results of the policy pursued by the European Central Bank have not exactly turned investors like Mr. Singer into a cheering section. The Elliott founder writes today via email:
The ECB has engaged in emergency monetary policy for 10 years, well after the end of the emergency. It has kept policy rates below zero and added several trillion euros of bonds to its balance sheet, yet growth continues to be subpar. ECB officials assert that their policies have been successful, and that without their exertions, results would have been much worse. But nowhere do they acknowledge the negative collateral effects of their policies, such as rising inequality, increased risk-taking and an inability of most citizens to earn a decent return on their savings. Given the vast difference in the ECB's rates and balance sheet between 2008 and today, one can only look to the heavens to imagine how the bank will respond to a new recession or deep stock market decline. Moreover, if the ensuing monetary flood results in a significant uptick in inflation, the fall in bond prices could be profound.
Here's hoping that when this monetary adventure finally ends, proportions of the damage will be somewhere south of biblical.

Origins of the Collusion Story Writing in the Washington Post magazine, T.A. Frank has an interesting profile of former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, whose alleged ties to Russia allegedly helped inspire the Obama administration to begin its counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign in 2016. In the course of his profile, Mr. Frank raises interesting questions about the man who allegedly told Mr. Papadopoulos that the Russians possessed damaging information about Hillary Clinton:
Conspiratorial stories can be reasonable or insane, but most have the same trigger: a glitch in the narrative, something in the official explanation that doesn't make sense. In the case of George Papadopoulos, that glitch is Joseph Mifsud.
The New York Times has called Mifsud "an enthusiastic promoter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia." Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have labeled him a "Kremlin-linked" "cutout." Documents later produced by Mueller and his team suggested that, if not for Papadopoulos's lies, investigators might have elected to "challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States."
But Mifsud worked in high government circles in Europe, and no action taken by investigators suggests that they viewed him as a serious threat... Stephan Roh, a Zurich-based lawyer who communicates with the media on Mifsud's behalf, maintains that Mifsud "is not a Russian spy but a Western intelligence co-operator."
...If he was Kremlin-linked, then he managed to infiltrate a lot of European and possibly American institutions, and it's strange that there hasn't been an outcry or investigations into the breach. On the other hand, if he was part of Western intelligence, then, as Republican congressman Jim Jordan told Fox News, "that changes it all."

Texto completo: When in 1800 Parson Weems published "A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington," this and later editions would become the source of treasured chestnuts such as the tale of the 6-year old George killing his father's cherry tree or the older Gen. Washington kneeling in the snow to pray at Valley Forge.
With its saccharine moralizing and portrait of larger-than-life integrity, it isn't unlike today's tales about former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey. Except that the glowing picture of Parson Comey as a paragon of virtue is a self-portrait.
Like the itinerant preachers who once brought the Gospel to the vast American countryside, Parson Comey periodically rides the circuit. In his case, this means appearing on CNN, penning an op-ed for the New York Times, or posting his pensees on Twitter, where he preaches the moral turpitude of anyone who may question, say, using a dossier he himself characterized as "salacious and unverified" to get a warrant to spy on an innocent American. But as with Parson Weems before him, Parson Comey's tales aren't holding up under the light.
Parson Weems, for example, gave us Washington telling his father, "I cannot tell a lie . . . I did cut it with my hatchet." In the Parson Comey version, the then-FBI director tells the president "I don't leak, I don't do weasel moves" -- only later to leak to the Times FBI memos detailing private conversations with the president. To avoid leaving his fingerprints, Mr. I Cannot Tell a Lie leaked via a law-professor friend.
Or what about the parson's tall tale about the FBI agents who'd interviewed national security adviser Michael Flynn at the White House? When Bret Baier of Fox News asked him if he'd told Congress that the two agents who'd interviewed Mr. Flynn "didn't believe [he] was lying intentionally," he insisted he hadn't said it.
But when the House Intelligence Committee got the redaction lifted from their report on Russia, there it was on page 54: Parson Comey testifying that the FBI agents saw "nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them."
We now know too that Parson Comey briefed Mr. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, about the Steele dossier. Yet though this exemplar of truth and transparency told the president-elect about the accusations involving Russian prostitutes, he withheld information that the FBI had used the unverified dossier to get a warrant on a former member of Team Trump because it believed the campaign was conspiring with Russians to steal the election. This week former FBI counsel James Baker said in a Yahoo News podcast that he worried that when Director Comey was assuring Mr. Trump he wasn't the subject of an investigation, it wasn't quite true.
Alas, the parson hasn't stopped trading on his former job to advance unsupported insinuations. When CNN's Anderson Cooper recently brought up the Russian prostitutes again and asked if it is possible the Russians have leverage over President Trump, he replied, "Yes."
In wake of the exhaustive FBI/Mueller investigation, the honest answer would be: "It's possible. But the FBI relies on evidence. And in more than two years of investigations, no one's found any."
For the past few years the auto-hagiography of Parson Comey has been uncritically received because it has been thought useful to the anti-Trump cause. In its review of his book, for example, the Times indulged in a riot of Weemsian excess: "nonpartisan and well-intentioned"; "boy-scout polite"; "fierce, go-it-alone independence"; "straight-arrow bureaucrat"; "apostle of order and the rule of law"; and so on.
Yet now there's a new team in the parsonage, and they are taking an objective look at what happened at the FBI during the Comey years. The question is whether the mistakes were simply a result of sloppiness and overzealousness or a deliberate abuse of power.
This may explain why Parson Comey has of late been casting more first stones than usual. In recent days he's informed former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that President Trump has "eaten" his soul, sermonized that Attorney General William Barr lacks the character needed to run "an organization based on truth," and assured America that the president had "corrupt intent" when he asked the White House counsel to sack Robert Mueller. Apparently the former FBI director's abilities include not only upholding the law and fighting off foreign foes but seeing into other men's souls.
Yet, say this for Jim Comey: The parson knows his congregation. And he feeds it from Mount Self-Righteous, with a mix of Democratic talking points, proclamations about the wickedness of anyone with a different point of view, and the occasional lofty quotation from Reinhold Niebuhr. Ralph Waldo Emerson never met Parson Comey, but plainly he was well-acquainted with the type: "The louder he spoke of his honor," Emerson wrote, "the faster we counted our spoons."

Texto completo: What's on TV
BLOOD & TREASURE 9 p.m. on CBS. Hints of James Bond and Indiana Jones are sprinkled throughout this fast-paced espionage series. The action begins when a terrorist, Karim Farouk (Oded Fehr), kidnaps an antiquities expert and blows up the tomb of Antony and Cleopatra. That sets off an international chase led by Danny McNamara (Matt Barr), a former F.B.I. agent who seeks out the help of an art thief, Lexi Vaziri (Sofia Pernas), who also happens to be his ex-lover. (While the show relies on the trope of a Middle Eastern terrorist, the creators try to balance that by having Lexi be Egyptian.) She's quick to whip out her lethal gadgets; Danny's the patient, mindful one. And the occasional sexual tension lends a bit of spice to an otherwise hackneyed plot. The show debuts with a two-hour episode, and will air at 10 starting May 28.
THE VOICE 9 p.m. on NBC. The final four contestants of this vocal competition -- Gyth Rigdon, Maelyn Jarmon, Dexter Roberts and Andrew Sevener -- had one last chance to showcase their talents yesterday, putting on three performances each. One of them goes home a winner after this two-hour season finale.
BLACK-ISH 9 p.m. on ABC. In the Season 5 finale of this family sitcom, Junior (Marcus Scribner) gets an offer to work for the hip-hop group Migos -- his dream job. But there's a fork in the road: His parents are less enthused and think he should return to college. The series has been renewed for a sixth season, and its franchise continues to grow. In addition to the spinoff "grown-ish" on Freeform, a prequel, "mixed-ish," about Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross) growing up mixed-race in the 1980s, is in the works.
What's streaming
WANDA SYKES: NOT NORMAL (2019) Stream on Netflix. The actress and comedian Wanda Sykes wastes no time in her first Netflix special; She opens by saying that if anyone voted for President Trump and came to see her, they made another mistake. (We won't publish her exact words.) She devotes much of the performance to politics, but also dives into reality TV, her family life and menopause. In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine, Sykes said, "It is the job of a comedian to talk about the world and its problems," but that shouldn't be all: "I'll do 20 minutes on race or Trump and then do a silly joke about having a hot flash."
MOONLIGHT (2016) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Barry Jenkins' poetic tale about the life of a young, black gay man in Miami, told in three stages, seems to have set the bar for his later films: The movie took home three Oscars, including best picture, and tugs at the heartstrings from beginning to end.

Did Democrats Just Create a Problem with Soccer Moms and Dads? A Friday House vote could be the sleeper issue of 2020.

Texto completo: Every Democrat in the House chamber on Friday voted for the appealingly titled "Equality Act." But next year Democrats are likely to find that support for the bill among swing voters is far from unanimous.
The New York Times reports :
The House passed sweeping legislation on Friday that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
The legislation, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in both the public and private sectors, offering civil rights protections in businesses, hospitals and welfare services. It explicitly states that individuals cannot be denied access to a locker room or dressing room on the same basis.
This last issue has garnered much attention but according to the Times the controversy surrounding the bill goes further:
Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took to the floor to argue that the legislation would harm children and set back the civil rights gains won by women.
"I implore my colleagues to listen to the stories of every stakeholder here, including the transgender girls and boys this bill is meant to help — because we may be hurting them by allowing doctors to prescribe hormones and perform major surgeries on adolescents without parental consent or involvement," Mr. Collins said.
The legislation appears to expand government power in a number of significant ways. Today Brad Polumbo writes in USA Today:
The bill purports to protect LGBT Americans like me by prohibiting discrimination... On the surface, this sounds unobjectionable — after all, no one deserves to face discrimination. Yet the bill defined "public accommodations" so loosely and called for regulations so sweeping that it would crush religious freedom and radically reshape American society.
For example, the Equality Act undermines the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which established a balancing test for religious freedom claims. It established a process for the litigation of discrimination grievances, where religious employers could appeal if found responsible for an offense and their actions could be fairly evaluated.
This helped ensure that reasonable invocations of religious freedom are permitted, such as a private, Catholic school only wanting to hire teachers who live in accordance with biblical values, but blatant discrimination, such as a grocery store randomly firing someone for being gay, is not. Yet in any of these situations, the so-called Equality Act would mandate that an LGBT person's claim wins by default — therefore not ensuring equality but elevating their rights over those of religious Americans.
Prior to the House vote, Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote in Reason:
Libertarians who don't fear fading gender norms and who fully desire to see social equality for all people can still see some causes for concern in the legislation, which would drastically extend the federal government's prerogative to intervene in college life, micromanage private business exchanges, and punish disfavored groups or companies, among other things.
Libertarians and social conservatives aren't the only ones expressing reservations. Duke law professor and former track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis legend Martina Navratilova and four-time Olympic gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross wrote about the bill last month in the Washington Post. They urged lawmakers to amend the bill in order to protect women's sports and specifically to maintain the law known as Title IX, which has been interpreted to require educational institutions that receive federal money to provide separate programs and opportunities for females. "This is necessary because sex segregation is the only way to achieve equality for girls and women in competitive athletics," wrote Mses. Coleman, Navratilova and Richards-Ross. The three athletic stars added:
In its current form, the Equality Act would do significant damage to Title IX and to the Amateur Sports Act, which governs sports outside of educational settings. The new legislation would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act by redefining "sex" to include "gender identity."
...a sports team couldn't treat a transgender woman differently from a woman who is not transgender on the grounds that the former is male-bodied. Yet the reality is that putting male- and female-bodied athletes together is co-ed or open sport. And in open sport, females lose.
The authors then explained the implications of allowing people born male to compete against females:
Team USA sprinter Allyson Felix has the most World Championship medals in history, male or female, and is tied with Usain Bolt for the most World Championship golds. Her lifetime best in the 400 meters is 49.26 seconds. In 2018 alone, 275 high school boys ran faster on 783 occasions. The sex differential is even more pronounced in sports and events involving jumping. Team USA's Vashti Cunningham has the American record for high school girls in the high jump at 6 feet, 4½ inches. Last year just in California, 50 high school boys jumped higher. The sex differential isn't the result of boys and men having a male gender identity, more resources, better training or superior discipline. It's because they have androgenized bodies.
The bill is going nowhere while Republicans control the Senate and the White House. But based on the unanimous support among House Democrats, voters can reasonably expect such legislation to become law in the event of a Democratic sweep in 2020.
Progressive politicians may be surprised to learn that imposing on girls and women a radical change in the rules of sport will not be universally welcomed by competitors or by the parents who love to watch them play.

Joe Biden on the Trail In a piece entitled, "Joe Biden Is the Democrats' Safety School," Walter Shapiro describes the former vice president and the reception he's getting in New Hampshire for the New Republic:
Speaking off a Teleprompter (not a normal Biden tradition) at a rally at Manchester Community College on Monday night, the candidate said about his roots in Scranton, Pennsylvania, "My friend Barack would make you think that I was a coal miner coming out of the mine with a lunch bucket in my hand. But I'm not. My dad was a white-collar salesman."
That quote contains multitudes—many of the strengths and minuses of the Biden candidacy.
Begin with the Obama connection, along with the reminder of Biden's appeal to the kind of blue-collar Democrats who defected to Donald Trump in 2016. But there was also a hint of Biden's new-found caution as he stressed that his father actually wore a tie to work. No other politician telling a similar story would have felt compelled to, in effect, raise his right hand and solemnly swear, "I am not now, nor have I ever been, a coal miner."
But Biden, in every speech, hears echoes of the past—and political mistakes that he made.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump on Monday directed former White House counsel Don McGahn to rebuff a congressional subpoena to testify the next day, escalating a standoff over a key witness to the president's efforts to curtail and shut down the special counsel's Russia investigation.
The White House sent to the House Judiciary Committee a memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel that argued Congress can't compel the president's senior advisers to testify about their official duties.
"The president's immediate advisers…exercise no statutory authority and instead act solely to advise and assist the president," the memo stated. "Their independence from Congress reflects that of the president."
Mr. Trump, leaving the White House Monday evening for a trip to Pennsylvania, said the administration had decided to block Mr. McGahn's testimony to set a "very important precedent." He said it was "for the office of the presidency."
William Burck, a lawyer for Mr. McGahn, told the House Judiciary Committee Monday evening that his client would "respect the president's instruction," according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
He added: "Mr. McGahn understands from your prior correspondence that the Committee would vote to hold him in contempt should he not appear tomorrow.…While we disagree with the Committee's position and hope it will instead seek an accommodation with the White House, Mr. McGahn also must honor his ethical and legal obligations." The committee's issue, he wrote, "is not with Mr. McGahn but with the White House."
The Trump administration has repeatedly blocked congressional Democrats' subpoenas and requests for documents and testimony since Democrats took control of the House in January. Mr. Trump has said he plans to fight "all the subpoenas."
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) said Monday evening that the president "clearly does not want the American people to hear firsthand about his alleged misconduct, and so he has attempted to block Mr. McGahn from speaking in public tomorrow." He called the White House's directive to Mr. McGahn "just the latest act of obstruction." He said the committee still expected Mr. McGahn to appear on Tuesday.
Mr. Nadler said last week that the committee would hold in contempt any individuals who don't comply with subpoenas, which would send the matter to the court system.
In Monday's memo, the Office of Legal Counsel wrote that because the president can legally direct Mr. McGahn not to testify, "should the president provide that direction, Mr. McGahn may not constitutionally be penalized, civilly or criminally, for following it." The office said that included contempt proceedings.
After the April release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report detailing Russian election interference and the ways in which Mr. Trump tried to impede the probe, the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Mr. McGahn requesting his testimony and dozens of documents related to events Mr. McGahn witnessed or communicated about while working at the White House. This month, the White House directed Mr. McGahn not to provide those documents to the committee, saying they implicated "significant executive branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege."
In 2007, former President George W. Bush sought to prevent his former White House counsel, Harriet Miers, from testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. In 2008, a federal judge ruled that the White House's argument that Ms. Miers was immune from a congressional subpoena was "unprecedented" but said the White House could assert executive privilege during her testimony.
Under the Obama administration, the Office of Legal Counsel wrote a memo arguing that the president's closest advisers had "absolute immunity from congressional compulsion to testify about matters that occur during the course of discharging their official duties."
Mr. McGahn is prominently featured in Mr. Mueller's report . Mr. McGahn spent more than 30 hours speaking to Mr. Mueller's investigators, a person familiar with the situation said. Mr. Trump at one point asked him to have Mr. Mueller dismissed and later asked Mr. McGahn to deny news reports about that conversation. Mr. McGahn rebuffed both requests, according to the report.
Share Your Thoughts
To what extent do you think a president's advisers should be immune from being required to testify before Congress? Join the conversation below.
While Mr. Mueller's report outlined efforts by Mr. Trump to curtail or shut down the Mueller probe, the special counsel didn't pursue charges of obstruction of justice on Mr. Trump, citing in part Justice Department guidance that a sitting president can't be indicted. He also didn't establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government, despite repeated contacts with Moscow-linked entities in 2016.
Since leaving the White House in October, Mr. McGahn has remained tied to the president and the Republican Party. Jones Day, the law firm Mr. McGahn returned to after leaving the administration, represents the Trump campaign.
Within a day of the Mueller report's release, Mr. Trump asked White House special counsel Emmet Flood to inquire whether Mr. McGahn would release a statement asserting that he didn't believe the president's request that he seek Mr. Mueller's dismissal amounted to obstruction of justice, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. McGahn rebuffed the request.

Resumen: As Steph Curry moves to brink of another NBA Finals with Golden State, Seth steps out from his older brother's shadow with Portland.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Oregon – In a one-sided series that could - and perhaps should - have been competitive but never quite got there, the most heart-warming plot line has been a story of family.
Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr describes the Currys as the “royal family of the NBA. ”
Over the course of the Warriors’ three consecutive victories in the Western Conference Finals it has been hard to argue with that sentiment.
There's Dell Curry, a 16-year league veteran, watching over his sons, All-NBA sharp-shooter Steph and Portland Trail Blazers guard Seth, as they do battle. There's Sonya Curry, whose excited reactions when one of her boys produces a highlight-reel moment is just one of the ways she generates positive focus.
The league and its fans have enjoyed this story, and the brothers have backed up the narrative.
Even if the conference finals end in a sweep – with the Warriors hungrily hunting a Game 4 win and the glut of rest that comes with it -- on Monday at the Moda Center, we will remember this sibling meeting for quite some time.
Game 2 was the highlight and decisive point of the series. It was Seth’s best outing of the postseason, as he picked his brother’s pocket for four steals, was a defensive pest and nailed clutch fourth quarter shots, before Golden State’s late-game poise clinched the win.
That performance has done a lot for the younger Curry and his growing reputation, that much is commonly accepted. But how much impact has this matchup had on Steph?
It was just two weeks ago that the Warriors’ star had a question mark over him. He was struggling in the Western Conference semifinal series against the Houston Rockets, affected perhaps by a middle finger injury but also painfully low on confidence. Now, he is back to being one of the most dominant players in the NBA and a true star of this postseason. Kevin Durant’s injury allowing Curry more freedom is given most of the credit, but has the sibling battle broken him out of his mini-slump, too?
“It feels good,” Steph Curry said, when asked what it is like to be out there alongside Seth. “This was like the coolest experience I think I’ve ever had playing against him. ”
'An incredible story'
There is a spring back in Steph’s step and a smile on his face once more.
There is little time for worry and hesitancy when his younger brother is around, because, hey, brotherly things can happen. Like when Seth tried to get in his head at the free throw line as Steph lined up a pair of late attempts in Game 2.
“That’s like 70 in a row,” Seth said, trying to jinx him.
“About to be 72,” came the response.
There have been amusing moments and quotables aplenty. Steph has admitted that there have been times when he has gone through the motions of contesting shots to “look good” but hasn’t minded if Seth’s attempts have gone in.
Up in the stands, Dell and Sonya have worn hybrid jerseys of the teams, facilitated by a friend of Sonya’s with gifted needlework skills, while watching with their daughter, Sydel Curry-Lee.
“I thought of their parents at one point,” Kerr admitted. “Can you imagine watching your two boys go head-to-head in a playoff game and both hitting huge shots? It must have been amazing for them. It is an incredible story. ”

Finally finding his place
Seth Curry’s story has not been as seamless as that of his brother, already a three-time NBA champion.
Floating around the NBA and the G-League and never quite latching on through five seasons, he eventually got his contract with the Blazers and locked into the struggle for playing time. He has proven his worth now, with Blazers coach Terry Stotts emphasizing that he got heavy minutes here not because of sibling insight, but because of his talent.
In fairness, though, on the court, Seth does know his brother better than anyone.
“I’ve seen every Warriors game and every Steph game for the past 10 years,” Seth said. “I feel like I know some things he likes to do. ”
The situation has been a joyous one for the family, but also laced with trickiness. No matter what happens, the Currys will be left with one son going to the NBA Finals and another whose season ends in disappointment.
“I normally don’t get nervous at all,” Dell told The New York Times. “Playing 16 years in the league I thought that all my nerves were gone. But this has changed that. ”
These are the seventh set of brothers to meet in an NBA playoff series.
“As a parent what more can you ask for?” Warriors enforcer Draymond Green said. “Sonya is amazing and I love her, but Dell - as a father who has played in the NBA - that is a completely different thing. I can only imagine what that feels like. ”
LILLARD: Portland star playing through rib injury
Green, with a comedic twist typical of him, then joked he didn’t care about the story line aspect of it and hoped that “Steph destroys Seth. ”
That hasn’t happened, but the simple and inescapable truth of this series is that however much Portland’s passionate fan base has wanted them to be competitive, the Blazers have not been able to sustain their occasional bursts of productivity.
As a result, barring an extraordinary turnaround, Seth will leave these playoffs with his honor firmly intact and having shown he belongs. Meanwhile, ominously, his brother has gotten his mojo back.
Perhaps the family tone running through these conference finals has helped Steph feel comfortable again, and enabled him to get back to enjoying basketball. Past experience shows that when that happens . . . watch out.

Texto completo: Over the last four years, The New York Times staff photographer Josh Haner has been documenting with stills and video the effects of climate change around the world. A selection of his work about climate migration and Unesco World Heritage Sites affected by climate change is on display at Photo London at the Somerset House from May 16-19. Many of the images were taken by drone, but his most recent work in the Galápagos compelled him to work underwater as well. He spoke with James Estrin about his coverage. The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.
______
Q: What have been the biggest challenges in doing this work on climate change?
A: The effects of climate change happen on such a slow time scale that it is often difficult to document visually. As a result, I believe a lot of the climate change imagery we have become accustomed to has focused on polar bears floating on pieces of sea ice, or on calving glaciers. That type of repetitive imagery has made people numb to a lot of the important stories about how our changing climate is affecting people and places around the world.
There's a lot of research happening around climate change and we tend to do our stories based on the scientific evidence coming out of those reports. But it's difficult to make dynamic imagery of scientists in the wild. So we're looking for projects that are important and have visual appeal.
I've been documenting climate change with drones around the world for the last four years, and in that time I've seen increased regulations on drone use globally that has made it a lot more complicated to bring dynamic aerial imagery to our viewership.
Now, the majority of my time is spent filling out permit requests and license applications to get permission to use drones around some of the most fragile places in the world like Easter Island and the Galápagos Islands. First, I have to research each country's unique drone laws. Then I work with lawyers, governments, airspace regulators, customs officials and sometimes the country's air force to be able to use drones to make these photos and footage.
Q: You were in the Galápagos late last year.
A: We realized that the Galápagos Islands were important for our series on how climate change is affecting natural and cultural heritage sites around the world. As we started looking into research that's being done there, it became apparent that the majority of the effects were happening underwater. So I realized quite quickly that I would need to take a lot of underwater footage and photography.
Q: So flying a drone underwater was the solution?
A: Well we did consider using tethered unmanned submarine type vehicles mounted with cameras, but because of the tether cord, they're not allowed near the animals in the Galápagos. So that meant I needed to learn how to scuba dive. It had always seemed scary to me. I had drawn the line at snorkeling, which I love.
I spent my weekends over a couple of months learning how to dive off the coast of California in the Monterey Bay. I was lucky to have an instructor who was also an underwater photographer, because there are a whole host of unique issues around maintaining your equipment, preventing water leaks and dealing with sun flare and exposure.
Additionally, after months of discussions we were also granted the permission to fly drones in the Galápagos. One of the stipulations was that I had to be accompanied by a national park ranger the whole time while we were above land and in the water -- just to make sure that none of our recording negatively impacted the animals in their natural habitat. The rangers were looking at any effect on animal behavior and also were making sure we limited our impact on these very fragile lands.
All of our equipment and clothing had to be quarantined before we went onto these islands, many of which are off limits to visitors. We had to bring different clothes, including new shoes and hats for each island. The reporter, Nicholas Casey, and I had to strip down and put all of our belongings into plastic bags so that they could then be taken directly to quarantine when we were taken back to the main island.
Q: What did it feel like to be on these historic islands, some of which almost no one goes on?
A: Being on these islands was an unbelievable experience.
We had to commit to our itinerary in advance and just hoped that the weather would cooperate. Because there were so many restrictions on visiting these sites, we had to stick to our itinerary, which is difficult when you've never been to the places before.
Very few people have visited these locations and many of the bays don't have real names on maps, so it's very hard to Google. Trying to do preliminary research was almost impossible and we just had to trust our contacts there.
What's really unique about the Galápagos is that there are very few apex predators there. So the animals are usually not surprised by your presence. As long as you maintain a very calm demeanor they don't change their behavior.
That's also why they limit access to these places -- they don't want animals to become too accustomed to human visitors.
Q: What's the effect of climate change on the Galápagos?
A: There is so much going on. It is in the cross hairs of three different currents. El Niño and La Niña swings really affect it the hardest. We were looking at the ripple effect from warming temperatures affecting coral, which affects the smaller fish like sardines, which then affects the sea lions and birds that depend on them.
Q: How is photographing underwater different, and what are the challenges?
A: Dexterity becomes a problem underwater because you're wearing gloves and you're trying to manipulate small buttons on a giant plastic housing that holds your precious camera. And when you go to the Galápagos you're not taking a ton of backup gear with you because you have to be nimble as you move between land and sea and change islands.
You have to plan how deep underwater you're going to go, and choose your housing accordingly. Some only work a few feet deep and others can go much farther than that.
So you have to really commit to your focal length before you dive because there's no easy way to change lenses underwater. This is always a challenge especially when you're not quite sure what you're going to see in each location.
If you planned wrongly, you would have to surface, then flush out your equipment with fresh water, wait for it to dry, change your lenses, re-lubricate the rubber seals that go between the different pieces of your housing and then put it all back together and clean off any sand residue as well. That's just to change lenses, batteries or memory cards.
It takes a lot of planning and practice to decide how you're going to approach different situations. I was really learning as I went.
Q: So, is it quiet when you're diving? It would seem to me that while you have to be aware of everything, there's also, in some ways, fewer distractions.
A: I'm not sure that there are fewer distractions. The main challenge when I'm scuba diving is that my visual field is limited, because you're wearing a mask where you can't see far to the left or right.
Nick and I were always together -- along with the ranger -- so that when somebody saw something outside of the peripheral vision of another person we would tap each other's leg. We also had slates that we could write on underwater so that we didn't have to surface to talk and then spend time re-acclimating as we dove down.
A lot of the places we were diving were close to shore, so you would have some waves crashing against the coastline. But there were very few motorized vehicles around, and so it was very silent underwater. The loudest noise was that of the air bubbles from our regulator as you exhaled.
Q: How is it different than other environments you've photographed in?
A: There is limited visibility underwater, and animals are often camouflaged so you're doing a lot of searching for the animals and the plant life you're looking to document. It's a bit like a scavenger hunt but with a time pressure because you have limited amounts of air when you're underwater.
Q: How long does your air supply last underwater?
A: We had somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes of air and on one of the dives, a lot of our time was spent just trying to find a marine iguana underwater during the short amount of time they spend feeding on algae. They're camouflaged and difficult to see!
Q: Did you use a strobe?
A: I was not strobing because I was shooting video, but I did have some underwater LED lights. And that's just one more thing to manipulate when you're underwater. So besides focus, exposure, switching between stills and video, you then have to adjust the intensity and directionality of your lights that are on these articulating arms above the camera, and do all this when there are currents.
Q: What is the next challenge?
A: Some combination of drone imagery with maybe 3D modeling and interactive graphics so that you can use the movement of the drone to create narrative in the piece. That's what I'd like to experiment with more in the future.
I also tried time-lapse work in Yellowstone because drones were off limits in United States national parks. I became really enthralled by time-lapse imagery and I hope to use that a lot more in the coming years.
Q: You have always been a lover of the outdoors?
A: My dad was a lover of the outdoors and my parents each worked part time when I was growing up. When my dad was taking care of me we would often head into nature for hikes, and it became imprinted in me at an early age -- the importance of being in the outdoors. And I've continued doing that. I made some of my first photographs in forests around San Francisco and in the mountains of Yosemite.
Every summer I take long backpacking trips. I really feel the most at home when I'm away from all technology and sitting by a lake in the Sierra.
One of the major reasons that my wife and I recently chose to move to Northern California was to be closer to nature and closer to the places that I've backpacked and camped in as a child. We really want to share that with our daughter as she grows up.

Historical society to hear talk by Maine author
HEBRON — The Hebron Historical Society meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 28 , will feature Maine mystery writer William Andrews talking on “Historical Societies – Great Places for Murder.” The talk will be at the Town Office, 351 Paris Road. The public is invited.
Historian and author Peter Stowell of West Gardiner recently spoke on the history of spool mills in the state, beginning with the Kashmir shawl, which was expensive to produce. The Jacquard loom was invented in 1804 and this made shawls cheaper to manufacture. The paisley shawl became popular because of cheaper production costs. Later James Clark of Scotland wound thread on a lathe-made spool and along with cheaper labor, the spool industry was born. Buyers would pay a small deposit for each spool and production became lucrative.
Due to the availability of suitable wood, Clark came to America and set up a factory in Newark, New Jersey. White Birch became the wood of choice. It was plentiful, clean, workable and resisted staining. Initially much of the wood was shipped there from Maine, but soon factories were built in Maine, the first, records suggest, being in 1848 in what was identified then as “Berrysville,” near Lewiston. From then until 1975 there were a total of 151 mills throughout the state.
Records reveal the existence of 53 mills in Oxford County alone, including one on Ben Stone Road in Hebron.

Nike to Change Pregnancy Policy in Athlete Contracts; Sneaker giant says it won't reduce pay during pregnancy after criticism from Olympian Alysia Montaño

Texto completo: Nike Inc. said it is adding language to new contracts for female athletes that will protect their pay during pregnancy, after coming under fire for cutting compensation for some athletes.
The sneaker giant said Friday it had adopted the policy last year but was now writing the terms into its future endorsement deals. Previously, the contracts gave Nike the right to reduce pay if runners failed to meet performance thresholds for any reason, including pregnancy or childbirth.
Although Nike isn't changing existing contracts, the company said current athletes would receive similar protections. "We will provide appropriate assurances for existing contracts to reinforce our policy," a Nike spokesman said Friday.
The move comes days after one of its former runners, Alysia Montaño, criticized Nike and its rivals for their policies around pregnancy.
In an op-ed published in the New York Times , Ms. Montaño said that when she told Nike several years ago that she wanted to have a baby during her career, the company told her it would pause her contract and stop paying her. She changed sponsors and signed with Asics.
"The sports industry allows for men to have a full career and when a woman decides to have a baby it pushes women out at their prime," she said in a video published on Mother's Day .
On Saturday, Ms. Montaño, an Olympian and U.S. national champion, said she was pleased that Nike was adding protections in new contracts, but questioned the company's assurances for existing athletes. "If they get pregnant, are they just supposed to take Nike's word for it?" she said.
After switching sponsors, she famously competed in the 2014 U.S. championships when she was eight months pregnant. Following the birth of her daughter, she said that Asics also threatened to end her contract.
She had received assurances from Asics, she said, but those weren't enough. "Because it wasn't in my contract, they threatened to penalize me," she said in an interview Saturday. "I had to fight for my money."
Ms. Montaño said she is still waiting for Asics and other brands to provide more clarity on whether they are changing their contracts. "They are being let off the hook," she said.
Nike acknowledged it had reduced pay for a few female athletes, but said that last year it changed its policies so women would no longer be penalized financially for pregnancy. However, that change wasn't written into contracts.
"Moving forward, our contracts for female athletes will include written terms that reinforce our policy," the Nike spokesman said. "We recognize we can do more and that there is an important opportunity for the sports industry to evolve to support female athletes."
A spokesman for Asics said the company "honors the contracts of our athletes during the duration of their pregnancy and return to competition."

Is Duke still in picture?

Texto completo: The stepfather of Zion Williamson, the presumed No. 1 pick in the NBA draft next month, shot down speculation that the Duke star is unhappy with the possibility of playing for the New Orleans Pelicans, who won the top pick in the draft lottery on Tuesday, and is toying with the idea of returning to school for another season.
Granted, it was a stunner when the Pelicans cashed in a 6% chance and leaped past six teams with better odds to claim the top pick. So stunning was it that speculation immediately turned to the possibility that Williamson might balk at beginning his NBA career in New Orleans. Although Williamson and his family have time to consider all the options, his stepfather seemed to certain he’d start his NBA career soon.
The idea that he would return for a second season with Mike Krzyzewski’s Blue Devils, “that is not (something) that we have even considered,” Lee Anderson, his stepfather, said on the Off the Bench radio show in Baton Rouge, La.
According to Anderson, Williamson and his family accept how the lottery turned out.
“One thing that Zion has always been taught is that you accept the things that you can’t change. You change the things that you can change,” Anderson said. “This is one of the things that he had nothing to do with. It’s the process of the NBA, and certainly we’re excited about the Crescent City down there in New Orleans.”
Williamson has yet to sign with an agent or a shoe company, which helped fuel the speculation. But his stepfather said that arises more from the desire to make the right choices, given that Williamson is only 18.
“We just feel that there’s no real rush to do this right now,” Anderson said. “You don’t get many opportunities in life to have the leverage and to have the opportunity to control your own narrative. Therefore, we feel like we are in position now to do that. We just want to make sure that when we do whatever it is that we do, it’s the right decision. We don’t want to look back and have regrets about it. We just want to make sure that we do it right.”
Anderson said that the family is close and doesn’t listen to all the outside noise, whether it’s about playing after injuring his knee last spring or returning to Duke or other matters.
“I spoke with who’s that coach — (Alvin) Gentry. We met with David Griffin (the Pelicans’ executive vice president of basketball operations) and had a great conversation and are excited at the prospect of coming down there and getting settled and looking for a place to stay and all these good things.”
That aligns with a report from The Athletic’s Shams Charania, who tweeted that Williamson had a positive meeting with the Pelicans before the lottery.
Footage hit the internet of Williamson’s instant reaction to the lottery results, and his wide-eyed, grinning reaction allowed for a variety of interpretations. Was that a smile on his face, or more of a grimace?
Returning to Duke would be a very bold move that would cost Williamson millions in the short term. As it was, he escaped a major scare during his one season with the Blue Devils, when a knee injury he suffered when he slipped on the court after his shoe exploded turned out to be much less severe than initially feared.
Some thought Williamson should have heeded the warning that injury represented and never again played for Duke, but he said he was eager to rejoin his teammates for an NCAA tournament run. Two of his closest teammates, fellow freshman stars RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish, are also set to go pro, so they wouldn’t be around if Williamson returned.
For that and other reasons, it appears highly unlikely that Williamson would actually go back to Duke. Yet as The New York Times’ Marc Stein noted on Wednesday, leaving open the option to do so could give him leverage with the Pelicans, who are already engaged in a staredown of sorts with disgruntled all-star Anthony Davis. They reportedly hope he might be convinced to rescind his trade demand because of the tantalizing prospect of playing alongside Williamson.

'The Sun is
Also a Star'
1/2
Credits: Directed by Ry Russo-Young, starring Yara Shahidi, Charles Melton, John Leguizamo
Running time/rating: 1:40, PG-13 for some suggestive content and language
Teenagers need melodrama. They always have. It seems its big, sweeping emotions are somehow the only things that can match the high-stakes, hormone-enhanced teenage feelings. Director Ry Russo-Young excels at rendering those emotions with a singular sense of artfulness. In "The Sun is Also a Star," Russo-Young swirls together sun-dappled selfies, luscious skin, urban grittiness and hip-hop beats, the aesthetics perfectly matched to emotion. She creates a heady, knee-buckling mood that nearly conceals the weaknesses in story and performances.
The film is the feature adaptation of Nicola Yoon's second novel. Her first, "Everything, Everything," also went on to success as a movie adaptation, starring Amandla Stenberg and Nick Robinson in a swoony take on a Bubble Boy story. The sick teen genre is a well of deep potential with its heightened stakes and ticking clock. And in the structural sense, "The Sun is Also a Star" is also a sick teen movie - without sickness. But the stakes are high and the clock is ticking - on a mandatory deportation from the United States.
Yara Shahidi (of "black-ish" and "grown-ish") stars as Natasha, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants but a New Yorker through and through. The day before her family is set to be deported back to Jamaica, she makes a last-ditch attempt to change their fate by pleading their case to an immigration lawyer. She's spotted in Grand Central Station by Daniel ("Riverdale" star Charles Melton), who notices she's staring at the starry ceiling, and he interprets her "Deus Ex Machina" jacket as a sign. Daniel is a poet, a dreamer and believer in destiny, and he takes off after her. First he saves her from a speeding BMW in Chinatown, then persuades the science-driven Natasha to spend some time doing the "36 Questions" love study from the New York Times. "Give me a day," he says, "and you'll fall in love with me."
Easy for the easy-on-the-eyes Melton to say! Shahidi and Melton both possess an otherworldly kind of beauty, and combined with Russo-Young's lush, rhythmic cinematic style, you could just watch them bop around the city for hours, all shiny hair and plush lips. But then, they open their mouths and the spell is broken. The dialogue (the script is by Tracy Oliver) just grinds things to a halt, with speeches that are a bit too on the nose, and too-grand declarations of love. Then again, all those things seem so profound and meaningful at that age.
As pretty as Shahidi and Melton are, they just don't share a palpable chemistry. Shahidi is undoubtedly a star, and while Melton is charming and gorgeous with a goofy puppy-dog energy, the more dramatic moments demonstrate the upper limitations of his range. Shahidi's few short scenes with immigration lawyer John Leguizamo are far more riveting.
That's somewhat covered up by Russo-Young's impressive filmmaking. A New York City native, she captures the arresting energy of the city while imbuing the film with a sense of lyricism and grace, as if the streets are sprinkled with magical fairy dust. The world looks the way it feels when you're falling in love, like everything is at its best, and everything makes sense. When you're looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn't seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse.

Texto completo: A couple's convictions for distributing $20,000 worth of methamphetamine have been reversed in part because a federal prosecutor cited their belief in "Jesús Malverde" — known as the patron saint of narcotraffickers but also revered in Mexico as the angel of the poor.
Writing for a three-judge panel, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge John K. Bush of Louisville said in an opinion Wednesday that the attack on the defendants' religious beliefs was "utterly irrelevant to the question of guilt."
Bush said Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger West improperly used Luis Morales-Montanez's belief in the deity to imply he was "steeped in the drug culture" and to attack his credibility.
"A prosecutor may strike hard blows, but is not a liberty to strike foul ones," said Bush, who was appointed last year by President Donald Trump at the recommendation of U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. "The prosecutor crossed the line in this case."
Vacating the sentences of Morales-Montanez and Jessica Acosta and granting them a new trial, the panel said in its 3-0 ruling that "American courts universally condemn the injection of religion into legal proceedings" and that there was no "non-prejudicial explanation" for West's remarks.
West and a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Jesús Malverde has been revered for nearly a century in northwestern Mexico as a Robin Hood-type figure who took from the rich and gave to the poor, until he was killed by the police in 1909.
Malverde means "evil green" in Spanish, and he supposedly was nicknamed by his wealthy victims, from the association between green and misfortune.
Although he is worshiped by drug dealers, according to experts on Mexican culture and law enforcement officials, the poor also pray to Malverde for money and safe passage across the border into the United States.
Journalist Sam Quinones has written there is no evidence that the Malverde of legend ever lived, and the story probably emerged by mixing material from the lives of two documented bandits from the Mexican state of Sinaloa.
Courts in California, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas have ruled that Malverde trinkets and talismans are admissible evidence in drug and money-laundering cases, the New York Times has reported, quoting a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who said that while they are not a direct indication of guilt, they could be cited with other evidence, such as piles of cash, baggies and scales.
Prospective jurors in the trial earlier this year of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug capo known as El Chapo, were asked if they were familiar with Malverde, according to the El Paso Times.
And in an episode of "Breaking Bad," a federal drug agent keeps a Malverde bust on his desk to "help him know his enemy" and refers to him as the patron saint of drug dealers.
But writing in Huffington Post, R. Andrew Chesnut, chair of the Department of Catholic Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, said such portrayals are simplistic and ignore Malverde's appeal to the poor, those with disabilities, construction workers and migrants. Chesnut said that to hundreds of thousands of devotees, Malverde is el ángel de los pobres, the angel of the poor.
"He is a multitasker — people approach him for health, wealth and love," Chesnut said in an interview in which he described the prosecutor's remarks as "totally out of bounds."
The folklore hero figured in the 2017 trial of Morales-Montanez and Acosta before Chief District Judge Karen Caldwell in Lexington, in which they were found guilty of possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine. They were sentenced to 15 years in prison on that and other charges.
In his cross-examination of Morales-Montanez, West asked how his worship of Malverde fit into his beliefs as a Catholic. "Do you understand that there is a commandment that says thou shall not have any god before me?" the prosecutor asked.
In his closing argument, West said Morale-Montanez "prays for protection from police" and "prays that he doesn't get caught."
"I wonder how many prayers he said to Malverde before he walked into the courtroom," West said. "I wonder if he said a prayer for protection from the jurors of Central Kentucky."
The couple were arrested after police searched their Lexington home and discovered copious amounts of marijuana and cocaine as well as digital scales, $45,507 in cash — and a shrine to Malverde. They pleaded guilty to cocaine, marijuana and firearms charges but denied knowing anything about 2 pounds of meth found in a nearby apartment that Acosta had rented.
Montanez-Morales described himself as a "weed man" who only recently had expanded into cocaine to beef up his income for the Christmas season, according to the opinion.
The couple said they had sublet the apartment to a man named Brian Barnes, who they claimed they didn't know was a major methamphetamine dealer ultimately sentenced to 17 years in prison for trafficking.
Testifying for the defense, Barnes backed them up, saying they didn't know anything about his profession or why he rented the apartment.
But West, the prosecutor, said none of them was believable and cited Morales-Montanez's beliefs to undermine his credibility, calling him the "worshiper of a deity of a drug trafficking entity who prays for protection from police, prosecutors, court systems and juries."
Bush wrote for the court that while the evidence against the defendants wasn't overwhelming, it was sufficient to convict them — if not for West's improper comments.
Besides the religious remarks, the panel said the prosecutor also improperly vouched for the government's witnesses — he called one officer "a fine young man" — while calling the defense witnesses liars. Bush wrote the trial was "flagrantly unfair because of the prosecutor's flagrant misconduct."
He was joined by Judge Raymond Kethledge of Michigan. Judge Helene White, also of Michigan, said she was voting to reverse only because of the prosecutor's comments.

Building intended for T.M. Landry given to city

Texto completo: City officials have accepted the donation of a former downtown hotel that once served as a frequent meeting place and restaurant for the Opelousas' central business district and last year was donated to T.M. Landry College Prep.
The Board of Aldermen voted unanimously Tuesday to take possession at no cost of the three-story East Landry Street structure that has remained unoccupied. The building was owned and used by the Diocese of Lafayette as living quarters for a women's shelter. The shelter was transferred to a Lafayette location.
The diocese donated the building to T.M. Landry in 2018. After the private school became the subject of a New York Times article that quoted claims that school administrators abused students and forged college applications, the diocese noted it was not affiliated with it.
City Attorney Travis Broussard and Mayor Julius Alsandor told the aldermen that T.M. Landry school officials have been in negotiations for several months with state Rep. Dustin Miller and municipal officials to finalize the donation agreement and turn the building over to the city.
Broussard urged the aldermen to accept the donation at Tuesday night's meeting. Refusing to do so, Broussard said, might enable the school to look elsewhere at other interested parties seeking to negotiate a donation deal with T.M. Landry.
No representatives from the school spoke at the meeting. The school moved into a building in Lafayette that once housed a skating rink in March.
Since its completion in 1959, the building was known first as the Opelousas Inn and later The Downtowner. For the next 30 years, the hotel was used on a daily basis by businessmen who met there for weekly civic club meetings, luncheons and social events.
The city, according to Alsandor and Broussard, has no immediate plans for the building.
Broussard said the building was abandoned after diocese officials decided they had no use for it. He told the aldermen the building was donated by the diocese to T.M. Landry, but Broussard did not elaborate on the intentions the school may have had.
Two years ago, a representative from Cover Six, a private company that provides nationwide active-shooter training for law enforcement, had proposed using the building, but that plan never developed and the ex-hotel has continued to remain empty.
Broussard did not divulge an appraised value for the building, but he noted that in the diocese's action of donation, it was pointed out that the structure was worth an estimated $100,000.
Purvis Morrison, projects manager for the city, pointed out the building is located in what he called a "prime real estate area," and the city's acquisition costs amounted to nothing.
"This could rejuvenate the downtown area as it tries to move forward," Morrison said. "If the right type of development approaches us, the city could hand over the building and possibly make money, too."
Alsandor said possession of the building offers a number of what he described as "attractive possibilities," although he admitted he does not know its overall condition.

Texto completo: I love dogs, but what were the animal shelters thinking. Unknowingly, the shelters have possibly exposed dogs in San Juan County to an even greater risk of heartworm disease.
Heartworm is a disease transmitted from one dog to another dog by mosquitoes. This is what they call a vector (insect) transmitted disease. This disease is controlled by controlling the mosquito population (spraying) and the number of infected dogs by treatment with heartworm prevention medication. Unfortunately, a lot of dogs are not treated.
Why are we bringing infected dogs from out of state, especially Louisiana, that have a high risk of heartworm infection. "Eight of the nine dogs from Louisiana tested positive for heartworm." New Mexico does not typically have a high prevalence of heartworm because we do not have a lot of water for the mosquitoes to breed in.
We are fortunate in that our mosquito breeding season hasn't started yet, so the spread of the disease would be minimized. Control of the mosquito population is important. Also, is the treatment of your dog for heartworm. I am not a veterinarian, but once the symptoms develop, probably considerable damage is already done to your pet.
However, I am a microbiologist and Registered Sanitarian Emeritus, spending many years in disease control.
Please do the local dog owners and taxpayers a favor and do not accept any more dogs from states that have a high risk of heartworm disease.

Reader: Sharpe skipped some data "The Economics of climate change and the Green New Deal" (April 28) written by George Sharpe, an oil and gas investment manager, not surprisingly comes to the conclusion that the Green New Deal's energy plan isn't realistic. Stanford University's solutions project.org says otherwise: Our nation, and the world, can easily be powered by solar or wind alone. Energy storage will solve intermittency problems.
Sharpe doesn't mention some key data: Solar and wind energy is now as cheap or cheaper as any fossil fuel in over 70% of the US and the world, and will be cheaper everywhere by 2020 (Forbes, Lazard, IRENA).
By rapidly scaling up clean energy, the Green New Deal's energy plan will make solar and wind "essentially free" by 2030 without subsidies and with energy storage included (Financial Times, UBS Aug 2030). That's the kind of news the GOP and the fossil fuel industry doesn't want people to hear.
The New York Times estimates the Green New Deal's transition to clean energy will cost about $5 trillion over a decade, but it will also add $6.5 trillion to our economy (IPCC) and create 10-15 million good-paying, local, permanent (40-year) jobs with good benefits and pensions, the kind of jobs our country has been losing for decades.
Sharpe also ignores the international scientific community's warning that if we don't make Green New Deal-scale energy cuts by 2030, we'll have "catastrophic" global warming costing the US economy over $160 trillion (Forbes April 18). Just a half-degree increase in global temperatures more will cost Americans $13 trillion and we're currently on a trajectory to at least a 5 degree increase (IPCC). That would mean "global economic collapse" leading to "societal collapse" (National Academy of Sciences).
The Green New Deal's energy plan would more than pay for itself and greatly improve our economy. Clean energy jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs 3 to 1 (DOE).
The GND's energy plan doesn't have to cost consumers or taxpayers anything and it will prevent the total and permanent destruction of our nation. Why would we not do this?

Intelligence Suggests U.S., Iran Misread Each Other's Actions

Texto completo: Intelligence collected by the U.S. government shows Iran's leaders believe the U.S. planned to attack them, prompting preparation by Tehran for possible counterstrikes, according to one interpretation of the information, people familiar with the matter said.
That view of the intelligence could help explain why Iranian forces and their allies took action that was seen as threatening to U.S. forces in Iraq and elsewhere, prompting a U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf region and a drawdown of U.S. diplomats in Iraq.
Meanwhile, administration officials said President Trump told aides including his acting defense chief that he didn't want a military conflict with Iran, a development indicating tensions in the U.S.-Iran standoff may be easing.
However, there are sharply differing views within the Trump administration over the meaning of intelligence showing Iran and its proxies making military preparations, people familiar with the matter said.
Intelligence officials on Thursday briefed House and Senate leaders, along with the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate intelligence committees, on the Iran situation.
Some within the Trump administration argue that the intelligence indicates Iran is, or was, planning to strike first. On a trip to Baghdad last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an Iran hawk, said there were indications Iran was planning imminent attacks.
"I am convinced that the information and warnings that we have collected are of greater concern than the normal Iranian harassment activity that we've seen in the Persian Gulf and surrounding area," Rep. Mac Thornberry (R., Texas) said on Thursday. "So I don't think it's business as usual. It's cause for greater concern."
Iran repeatedly has denied it has plans to attack U.S. forces, calling the information cited by Mr. Pompeo and others "fake intelligence."
One U.S. official said the view of Iran's movements and actions as defensive in nature came from new intelligence in recent days. This unspecified intelligence has affected how American officials see Iran's actions, the official said.
"I don't think there's faulty intel here necessarily. I think the intel may be accurate," Sen. Angus King (I., Maine), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Thursday after he was briefed on some of the intelligence. "But the unanswered question, again, is: Are they reacting to our assertions of action in the Middle East or are we reacting to them? That's an unanswered question for me."
These assessments of the intelligence information were separate from Mr. Trump's comments to top aides including acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan that he doesn't want tensions between the U.S. and Iran to lead to war.
During a meeting on Wednesday at the White House, Mr. Trump made the comments to Mr. Shanahan as part of a conversation, the officials said, adding that Mr. Trump didn't issue a specific order.
The New York Times had earlier reported on those comments.
Mr. Trump in recent days has also told advisers that he is reluctant to start any kind of unilateral conflict with Iran, one administration official said.
Instead, he has expressed his interest in a negotiated solution, even if that means speaking to the Iranians directly, this person said, a move that would be counter to the recommendation of some top advisers.
Last week, Mr. Trump suggested Iran's leaders also consider talks.
"What I'd like to see with Iran, I'd like to see them call me," he said in remarks at the White House then. Iranian officials have said they don't see a reason to hold talks with Mr. Trump, who has pulled out of an international nuclear agreement with Iran and reimposed punitive economic sanctions.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump again steered around talk of a confrontation. Asked at the White House if the U.S. would have a war with Iran, he replied: "I hope not."
The comments came amid other signs that tensions between the U.S. and Iran may be easing after the U.S. over the preceding days undertook a series of military deployments in response to what officials described as intelligence showing increased Iranian threats.
On Thursday, two U.S. military destroyers, the USS McFaul and the USS Gonzalez, transited without incident through the Strait of Hormuz near Iran, officials said.
"It was the quietest transit we have seen in a long time," a defense official said. U.S. military vessels traveling through the area often encounter challenges from aggressive Iranian fast boats and other vessels, even though there rarely have been armed confrontations.
The Pentagon said the recent U.S. military deployments, consisting of an aircraft carrier, U.S. bombers and other ships and personnel, may have helped quell hostilities.
"The deterrence part of this is going pretty well from our perspective," the defense official said, citing the "effects we have seen."
The deployments, sought by military officials, were intended to deter any prospect of Iranian hostility, not as an offensive threat, military officials stressed.
"This is a case where credible intelligence drove measured, appropriate operations," a senior defense official said.
Mr. Trump on Thursday also met with President Ueli Maurer of Switzerland, holding talks that included a discussion of the crisis in the Middle East, the White House said. In Iran, Switzerland serves as a protecting power on behalf of the U.S. It also serves as a channel for diplomatic communication between the U.S. and Iran, since official diplomatic relations ceased between Washington and Tehran in 1979.
"President Trump expressed his gratitude for Switzerland's role in facilitating international mediation and diplomatic relations on behalf of the U.S.," the White House said.

Texto completo: Are you ready for another war in the Persian Gulf? I didn't think so. It will come as a disagreeable surprise, then, that the Trump administration appears to be preparing for one.
Banner headlines in The New York Times on Monday declared that the administration is thinking about sending up to 120,000 troops to the Gulf region, about the same number we sent the last time we invaded Iraq. Asked about the report, President Trump dismissed it as fake news - but then he added ominously that if he were to send troops, there would be a lot more of them than that.
So what's going on? The president's Twitter feed is no help in this case. He has taken issue with the stewards at Churchill Downs, and credit for the turnaround of the Red Sox. But on the question of war or peace in the Persian Gulf, @realdonaldtrump is largely silent. His Twitter feed came to life briefly Wednesday, to say that he wants to talk to Iran (undercutting his own administration), but the Iranians don't want to talk to him, so that offer is moot.
Ever since the Trump administration unilaterally pulled out of the carefully negotiated agreement that its predecessor concluded between Iran and the principal nuclear powers, including China, Russia, France and the U.K., we've been on a collision course with Iran. The administration has recently imposed sanctions against any state buying Iranian oil, which comes pretty close to being an act of war. The Iranians responded at first with relative restraint, but as these unilateral American sanctions have increasingly damaged the weakened Iranian economy, there are indications that Iranian patience may be reaching its limit. Iranian saboteurs seem to have damaged four tankers carrying Arab oil, and there are ominous intelligence reports of Iranian plans to attack American targets in the Gulf, either directly or through surrogates.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an emergency trip to Iraq last week, canceling a long-planned visit to Germany - to the fury of our German allies. Our absurdly large embassy in Baghdad has been stripped of its non-essential personnel, and national security adviser John Bolton has made a great show of announcing the dispatch of a carrier strike group and bombers to the Gulf, declaring that it was intended "to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force." Would the Iranian sabotage of Arab oil tankers qualify? Bolton presumably thinks so.
It is no surprise that Bolton is leading the charge. He's long been a supporter of an Iranian exile group, the People's Mujahedin. One of the original components of the Iranian Revolution, they fought with Iraq against their own people during the Persian Gulf War, and they are detested in Iran. More of a cult than a political movement, they have discovered that American politicians can be bought for the price of a $50,000 appearance. Rudy Giuliani, the president's television lawyer, is another one of their fans. It apparently does not bother their supporters that the group has the blood of an American military attachÃ© on their hands.
What all this will add up to is not clear, but the mixture of American bellicosity and Iranian desperation is potentially explosive. With Gen. James Mattis out of the Defense Department, one barrier to an ill-considered military adventure has been removed. We would seek to play to our advantage over Iran in the air and at sea, and there is said to be a plan for a cyber offensive on the shelf, too. It may all look good on paper, to Bolton and even to his boss, but once the dogs of war have been unleashed, it will be impossible to call them back.
This administration has no strategic direction, and in a confrontation with Iran, we would be isolated with the Gulf Arabs and Israel, without the support of our traditional allies in NATO. It is not exactly comforting to think that we may be dependent on the good sense of one Donald J. Trump to stop the rush to a war that could make the occupation of Iraq look like a walk in the park.

Texto completo: If you're going to write a book about sucking, you need to be qualified. A unique area of specialty, but Karen Rinaldi - by all accounts a successful writer and publisher - is well-suited. She's a passionate surfer whose skills, which are not expected to improve significantly, might generously be called "mediocre."
"I'm not in that honeymoon period of surfing when I'm trying it out, seeing if I'll get the hang of it, romancing it," she writes in her new book, "(It's Great to) Suck at Something." "By any objective measure, it's a big part of my life, and has been for a while. . . . And - I still suck at surfing. But I love it. I think, in its way, it loves me back."
That total, nonsensical dedication is key to Rinaldi's campaign to get us to try something new - something that won't make us more productive, pull in the big bucks or prompt anyone to marvel at our prowess. "Suck at Something" is a call to unleash the unexpected bliss that occurs when we "really, really struggle to do something unremarkable, uncelebrated and without much to show for it." It's a testament to perseverance without the pressure of perfection, to celebrating our failed efforts and becoming comfortable with discomfort.
Of course, we all already suck at something; to think otherwise, Rinaldi helpfully advises, is "delusional." But unless we really care about that something, it doesn't count here. Rinaldi is championing the continued pursuit of a hobby that we may improve at over time but will never truly shine at. Like your neighbor's daily guitar practice, which is . . . diligent (pre-Rinaldi, that would have been thinly veiled shade; she manages to transform it into a genuine compliment). Or sewing those ridiculous clothes you'll never wear in public but that make you happier than vintage Versace.
Rinaldi is an inspiring case study: She started surfing when she was 40 and, quickly taken with the sport, began arranging her middle-aged life around it. She's surfed eight months of the year for nearly two decades and wiped out her savings to buy a plot of land in Costa Rica, sight unseen, for better proximity to the ocean.
Five years in, she caught her first wave. Yes, for real. Lower that eyebrow - she loves it.
"Suck at Something" is an expansion of a viral op-ed Rinaldi, author of "The End of Men" - the novel that inspired the movie "Maggie's Plan" - wrote for the New York Times in 2018. Hundreds of readers responded that they, too, had discovered the joy of sucking: the runner who's mediocre on a good day; the bagpiper who lacks talent but makes up for it in gusto because "a girl's gotta rock." The weekend golfer whose golf score is what his bowling score should be, and vice versa, neither of which is a dissuading factor.
Such stories are rare, which is why Rinaldi's book feels more like a movement than just another self-help guide. Most of us would rather tell stories about our triumphs than our failures (unless there's a comedic spin); look no further than Instagram to confirm that the humblebrag is a national pastime. Even Rinaldi cops to allowing her colleagues to assume she was decent at her beloved hobby until, well, she made a national announcement about her ineptitude. Why? Because we live in a "era of aspirational psychosis," working longer and harder than our neighbors in pursuit of a calculated end-goal. Instead of accepting that it's okay to be inadequate at something, we ignore whatever that thing is, brushing it aside and, in turn, diminishing our lives. We suck at allowing ourselves to suck.
While talent is clearly useful, it's hard to argue with Rinaldi's logic that there's more to life than usefulness. Sucking "has a bad rap. It's a reputation thing," she writes. "There's nothing inherently unpleasant about being substandard at something. . . . It's just that our culture maligns and mocks ineptitude."
"Suck at Something" reads like a memoir, with a colorful, action-packed plot that reaches several pinnacles: the time Rinaldi couldn't wear pants, or sit down, for several weeks after almost tearing herself a - uh, experiencing a personal injury - comes to mind.
Such revelations are interspersed with expert commentary on the science and philosophy around sucking. Brené Brown preaches the benefits of embracing vulnerability; Andrew Zolli touts the deepened resiliency reserves that sucking fosters. We learn that if we release the illusion of control and lean into messiness, we'll lower our stress and raise our creativity. When we follow our passions and bask in them - regardless of performance - we bend in ways that are beneficial emotionally and physically.
The science is nice, but Rinaldi sells the power of sucking with her charm and wit. She's the relatable Everywoman, the friend who would totally come watch us lead our skee-ball team to ruins (and not pretend that our lowly 10-pointers were ah-mazing). The book is lighthearted but intimately introspective; the overarching message is empowering without being cheesy. By the time she's upright on her sleek Jim Phillips board, mid-breast cancer treatment and riding just one glorious wave, it feels like a battle cry: Suck without shame! Let's reclaim sucking! Try new things; you don't have to be good at them.
Anyway, we've needed a new cocktail party opener for years. Next time you sidle up to a stranger, silently toast Rinaldi and replace the tired "So, what do you do?" with "So, what do you suck at?"
And then get on with your imperfect life.

Texto completo: Tensions between the United States and Iran are escalating. On Wednesday, the State Department ordered all nonemergency government staff in the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, to leave the country after Washington said it learned of credible threats from Iran.
Iran hawks find loopholes for war
By Jon DiCicco
The escalating confrontation with Iran provides President Donald Trump and hawkish members of his administration a convenient one-two punch: an international crisis in the Persian Gulf that distracts from a constitutional crisis inside the Beltway.
Congress and the president appear to be locked in a slow-motion showdown over Democratic legislators’ demands for documents. The findings of the Mueller report and the subpoena showdown are turning up the heat on President Trump. In moments like these, an international crisis can do much to divert the attention of the news media and the public.
Enter the international crisis with Iran. Iran is a legitimate threat to U. S. interests; there is no doubt of that. But Iran’s war-making capabilities pose no immediate threat to America.
Iran has worked to frustrate U. S. ambitions in the region, and it has supported dangerous militia groups like Hezbollah. Now that "credible" intelligence of Iranian plans to attack U. S. forces has come to light, the Trump administration has responded with a demonstration of military muscle.
Talker: Women in Alabama are still Americans, still have a right to abortion: Today's talker
National security adviser John Bolton said the United States is “fully prepared to respond to any attack” but “is not seeking war with the Iranian regime. ” Skeptics may be forgiven for thinking that the opposite is true, and that Washington has been spoiling for a fight with Tehran for months.
The administration has requested from the Pentagon military strike options against Iran; the State Department designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization; it has been suggested that a presidential decision for military action against Iran may be covered under the 2001 Authorization for Use Military Force.
Eager to regain some semblance of control over foreign wars, senators last month reintroduced a stalled bill to “limit the use of funds for kinetic military operations in or against Iran. ” But the revived bill has little bite. Its prohibitions are rendered toothless by three exceptions: an imminent threat to America, a need to rescue endangered U. S. personnel or “a sudden attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces. ”
It’s significant that the new intelligence pinpoints U. S. forces in the Gulf region as the intended targets of Iran or its proxies. Should the White House use military force against Iran, what self-respecting American would speak out against protecting U. S. troops abroad?
The new intelligence cited by the administration also conveniently sidesteps the Senate’s attempt to corral the commander in chief, fitting cleanly within the exceptions noted in the bill. If the White House wants war with Iran — to protect our troops, to divert attention or both — Congress poses little more than a speed bump, and administration officials have made the moves necessary to roll right over it.
Jon DiCicco is associate professor of political science and international relations at Middle Tennessee State University. This column originally appeared in the Tennessean.
What others are saying:
Wendy R. Sherman, The New York Times: "Either the Trump administration is trying to goad Iran into war or a war could come by accident because of the administration’s reckless policies, but the prospect of the current tensions in the Middle East escalating into a serious conflict is now dangerously high. . . . It is crucial that the news media in the United States and elsewhere continue their crusade for the facts about what is going on with Iran. We cannot repeat the days before the Iraq War when even many of our most reliable news outlets repeated and amplified what was, in fact, a flimsy case for war. "
Marco Rubio, Twitter: "The current tension with Iran is nothing like the Iraq War. The only way this leads to war with Iran is if the (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) works with proxy forces to attack Americans first. "
Tucker Carlson, "Tucker Carlson Tonight": "More than anything in the world, national security adviser John Bolton would love to have a war with Iran. It would be like Christmas, Thanksgiving, his birthday wrapped into one. Mercifully, John Bolton doesn't command the military. President Donald Trump does. The question is how influential is Bolton in the White House?"

Tariffs, rumor of wars, stocks plunging. Guess the United States isn't doing so great after all.

Republicans know that a "war-time" president has never lost an election in modern times; that's the dirty little secret.

Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was a beast, but we were lured into a war citing weapons of mass destruction when there were none. We shouldn't make the same mistake.

Time to get our people out of all of these countries. We do not need to have a presence there, and we certainly don't need to be sending them any money or anything else.

Top Treasury Department Official to Depart; Craig Phillips, Trump administration point person for financial deregulation, will return to private sector

Texto completo: Craig Phillips, the driving force behind the Trump administration's effort to revamp Wall Street oversight, is leaving the Treasury Department to go back to the private sector, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Phillips told Treasury staff of his plans on Thursday. He is the latest of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's top deputies to depart. Mr. Phillips's exit throws a cloud over the administration's plans to overhaul the way many Americans finance home purchases.
Mr. Phillips's departure, expected to occur soon, leaves another top vacancy at an agency juggling some of the Trump administration's top economic-policy priorities, from international sanctions to trade negotiations to implementation of the 2017 tax law.
The former BlackRock Inc. executive has emerged as a central figure in the department , helming the administration's plans for financial deregulation and serving as a key contact for the financial industry.
The Treasury Department is expected as early as next month to complete a plan outlining an overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance giants that have been under government control since the financial crisis. That plan is already far along in its development, but the timing of its release is less clear with Mr. Phillips's departure, according to people who have discussed the matter with Treasury officials.
Mr. Phillips plans to stay until the proposal is released, the Treasury Department said in a written statement. "Craig has been critical in establishing a housing policy finance reform framework," a Treasury spokesman said. "The secretary appreciates his service to the administration and to the country."
The New York Times earlier reported Mr. Phillips's departure.
People familiar with the situation said Mr. Phillips in recent weeks has had conversations with financial-firm executives, signaling he was likely to soon return to the private sector.
His departure comes after he was passed over by the administration for a post overseeing Fannie and Freddie, according to people familiar with the selection process. That job—heading up the Federal Housing Finance Agency—instead went to Mark Calabria, a libertarian economist and former aide to Vice President Mike Pence who was confirmed last month.
David Malpass, the former undersecretary for international affairs, left in April for the top job at the World Bank . Heath Tarbert, Treasury's assistant secretary for international markets, was nominated earlier this year to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Eli Miller, Mr. Mnuchin's chief of staff, left the agency last month, and Tony Sayegh, the assistant secretary for public affairs, is expected to leave after the G-20 meeting in June.
Mr. Phillips had effectively been fulfilling the duties of the undersecretary for domestic finance, a position that hasn't been filled by a Senate-confirmed nominee since Mary Miller left the Obama administration in 2014 .

The Great Idaho Do-Over; A governor is suddenly granted the power to make himself less powerful.

Texto completo: Inaugurated just four months ago, Gov. Brad Little (R., Idaho) has unexpectedly been given the chance of a political lifetime. The state's legislature has recently given him enormous discretion to reduce the power and discretion exercised by his government.
James Broughel of George Mason University's Mercatus Center has the story :
Something rather remarkable just happened in Idaho. The state legislature opted to—in essence—repeal the entire state regulatory code. The cause may have been dysfunction across legislative chambers, but the result is serendipitous. A new governor is presented with an unprecedented opportunity to repeal an outdated and burdensome regulatory code and replace it with a more streamlined and sensible set of rules. Other states should be paying close attention.
The situation came about due to the somewhat unconventional nature of Idaho's regulatory process. Each year, the state's entire existing body of regulations expires unless reauthorized for an additional year by the legislature. In most years, reauthorization happens smoothly, but not this year.
Instead, the legislature wrapped up an acrimonious session in April without passing a rule-reauthorization bill. As a result, come July 1, some 8,200 pages of regulations containing 736 chapters of state rules will expire. Any rules the governor opts to keep will have to be implemented as emergency regulations, and the legislature will consider them anew when it returns next January.
Idaho lawmakers have essentially seen the governor and raised him through the roof. Earlier this year, Gov. Little followed the example of President Donald Trump and issued an executive order requiring state agencies to cut two existing rules for every new one they impose.
When the legislature handed him the authority to go much further, the governor was perhaps taken aback by the sudden expansion in his ability to make his government less intrusive. The Idaho Statesman reported last month:
Idahoans can trust him to do the right thing, Republican Gov Brad Little said, after the Legislature handed him sweeping authority to eliminate thousands of state-approved rules without public participation or lawmaker oversight.
"I'm not looking at this as an opportunity to do mischief," Little said during a public appearance Tuesday. "I do not want to exacerbate this thing. This was not our deal. We did not do this."
It is of course a rare opportunity to eliminate the bureaucratic mischief done by others, and Mr. Little wasn't the only one surprised by his sudden good fortune. The public broadcasters at Boise State University interviewed a political science professor at the school, Jaclyn Kettler:
She says the acrimony that characterized the legislature's decision not to re-up the rules was indicative of how the session wound down.
"The last few weeks of the session I was constantly going, 'Yeah, I never would've predicted this would've been an issue,'" Kettler says slightly mystified. "It was just kind of a bizarre session all around."
Bizarre, and yet so very, very beautiful. A few days later, the governor's office clarified that most regulations will remain at least temporarily in effect:
The majority of existing rules will be reauthorized before July 1. Agencies will re-publish the rules as "temporary and proposed rules" concurrently in a special edition of the Idaho Administrative Bulletin in June 2019. Agencies will accept written comments in accordance with state law. All rules reauthorized through this process are subject to legislative review during the 2020 legislative session.
Governor Little's administration will use the unique opportunity to allow some chapters of Idaho Administrative Code that are clearly outdated and irrelevant to expire on July 1, 2019.
Mr. Broughel at Mercatus describes how the temporary regulations could also be eliminated:
The new scenario creates multiple touch points when rules could end up on the cutting room floor. First, when regulations expire on July 1, many will not be refiled. Second, the public will have the opportunity to comment on regulations that are resubmitted. In some cases, public hearings are likely to take place, presenting another opportunity to reshape, and cut, some regulations. Finally, when the legislature returns next year, it will need to pass a reauthorization bill for those regulations Governor Little's administration wants kept. Even more red tape can be trimmed then.
One of America's most vibrant state economies now has the chance to exceed all others. Earlier this month, the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the Idaho economy grew by an impressive 4.1% in 2018. "Durable goods manufacturing was the leading contributor to the increase in real GDP in Idaho, the third fastest growing state," added the bureau.
It's no secret why Idaho has been booming, with robust growth in its gdp and population over the last decade. The same month that Mr. Little took office, the American Legislative Exchange Council gave its second highest ranking among the states to Idaho's economic outlook. Tax rates are competitive and regulation is already light. Workers are not forced to join unions, and the state doesn't require wages to be higher than the federal minimum. Idaho's courts are relatively unfriendly to tort lawyers.
Some big-spending pols in the northeast like to pretend that they are losing population to low-tax states like Florida and Texas because residents are simply choosing warmer weather. But as the ALEC report notes, snowy Idaho has been busy welcoming former Californians.
With a further reduction in the reach of the public sector, a more private Idaho could post even faster growth. Mr. Little's official biography states :
Brad has advocated his whole life for limited government. He works to ensure the lightest possible hand of government in the lives of Idaho's citizens, and he seeks to build the public's confidence in State government.
Now he gets to show that he really means it.
Bold action could not only make Idaho the undisputed champion of economic competitiveness within the U.S., but inspire other states as well. Mr. Broughel at Mercatus notes that "whether intentionally or not, Idaho deserves credit for advancing the frontier of regulatory reform in a new and innovative way."
Maybe someday even legislators in places like Connecticut and New York will study the results. The moving vans headed west should eventually get their attention.

Texto completo: Another day, another Democrat throws a hat in the ring, and voters ask, now who ?
With the entry of Montana Governor Steve Bullock earlier this week and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday morning, a record 24 major candidates (and counting) are jostling for the Democratic nomination for president in the race to unseat Donald Trump in 2020. The vast Democratic field — the largest and most diverse in presidential primary history — is more packed than a Red Line platform during a service delay and, for many prospective voters, just as maddening to navigate.
The roster, as it now stands now, includes several US senators and congressmen, a batch of current and former mayors, past and present governors, the former vice president, a tech entrepreneur, and a spiritual adviser to Oprah. Others are still publicly mulling bids, such as Stacey Abrams, Democratic rising star and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate.
“It's a lot," as Rebecca Pinn, the Boston-based president of the Young Democrats of Massachusetts, put it, even for politically plugged-in voters like her.
So how can the average news consumer possibly keep up?
“I can't name all of the 22 or 23" candidates, Pinn said. “If I can't do that, how are we expecting people who are working two jobs, have multiple kids and busy lives . . . to keep track of all this?"
For 77-year-old Julian Peterson, the answer is “with difficulty." At the Harvard Coop Bookstore on Tuesday afternoon, where a 736-page paperback of the Mueller report is on sale for 30 percent off, Peterson, an adult education teacher who lives in Cambridge, weighed the Democratic contenders while taking a break from reading the New York Times.
“There's an awful lot of overlap between the candidates," he said. “I'm a homie. I like Elizabeth Warren, but I also like Julián Castro."
Still, Peterson added, he suspects none of the candidates will rise above the pack.
“Nobody seems to be very convincing, and that's the trouble with Democrats," he said. “There's nobody that has the real charisma that even Trump has. Even though you may not like him, people pay attention to him. He's a showman, and people like that."
Peterson added, “I'm just as much at sea as anyone else is about this."
There are, however, some advantages to having a broad swath of candidates from which to choose. Warren Behr, chairman of the Cambridge Democratic Party, views the swelling tide of presidential hopefuls as a sign of party strength.
“Most of the announced candidates are well-qualified contenders who would do well in the Oval Office," Behr said. And a tough primary battle, he added, will prepare the eventual nominee for “what will undoubtedly be a difficult and nasty general election campaign."
But there's a downside to this endless buffet of presidential contenders: It's called “option paralysis," said Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University. The risk is “that voters will have so many options available to them, they will effectively become frustrated, tired, and confused and possibly opt out of voting all together."
In his influential 2004 book, “The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less," psychologist Barry Schwartz argues that the “proliferation of choice" in our modern lives — whether we're standing in the grocery aisle picking among hundreds of cereals or scrolling through Netflix debating which movie or TV show to stream — is making us increasingly anxious and depressed.
Schwartz noted Thursday that although there's no research on the problem of choice overload on electoral politics, he sees three possible effects of the voluminous field on potential voters.
One, of course, is paralysis, in which voters decide against participating in the election rather than making any choice at all. Another is bad decision-making, whereby voters, attempting to overcome their paralysis, choose a candidate based on “superficial, easy-to-evaluate" qualities, like race, gender, and charisma, rather than harder-to-evaluate factors, such as policy proposals and ideas. The third is dissatisfaction with the Democratic party's eventual nominee: voters, pining for rejected candidates, may feel less enthusiastic about the eventual standard-bearer.
“This said, there is a wild card in the presidential race that is not present when people are buying a dishwasher or cereal," Schwartz said. “The wild card is named Trump. His presence as the alternative may be enough to get people to overcome choice paralysis and stick with it."
Liberal-leaning Justin von Bosau, who graduates Friday from Boston University with a degree in film and television, is gearing up for disappointment this election season. While he admits he hasn't been following the primary race as closely as he should, he remains pessimistic about the Democratic Party's chances of producing a contender capable of trouncing Trump.
“There's just not enough word about who these people are to individualize any of them, and there's not enough word about what they actually stand for unless you go out and really dig in and search for it," von Bosau said. “It shouldn't be that difficult if you're trying to vote for somebody."
“I think if you have so many people," he continued, “it all just blends together."

TOP INTERNATIONAL STORY MIDDLE EAST: Allies worry about U.S.-Iran clash: International worries that the Trump administration is sliding toward war with Iran flared into the open Wednesday amid skepticism about its claims that the Islamic Republic poses a growing threat to the U.S. and its allies in the Persian Gulf and beyond. President Donald Trump has dismissed reports that the U.S. is planning for a military conflict with Iran, and brushed aside a New York Times report that the White House is reviewing military plans to send 120,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East as "fake news."

Texto completo: The U.S. State Department ordered a partial evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday, responding to what the Trump administration said was a threat linked to Iran, one that has led to an accelerated movement of U.S. ships and bombers into the Persian Gulf. The department ordered "nonemergency U.S. government employees," at both the embassy in Baghdad and the consulate in Irbil, to leave the country.
Why it matters
The Trump administration maintains it has received intelligence related to "Iranian activity" that put U.S. facilities and service personnel at "substantial risk." Other U.S. officials have said the same piece of intelligence points to potential attacks by Shiite Arab militias tied to Iran against U.S. troops in Iraq or Syria.
Reaction
Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, a senior officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group, said "there's been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria," in the region to United States and coalition forces. The Pentagon's Central Command said in a statement that Ghika's comments "run counter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from U.S. and allies regarding Iranian backed forces in the region," and that as a result, United States forces in Iraq were "now at a high level of alert." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also
weighed in Wednesday, saying "We have to avoid any war with Iran."
Why tensions now
Tensions with Iran have been rising since May 2018, when President Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal that world powers reached with Tehran. The United States then reinstated major sanctions last November, and those have weakened the Iranian economy.
Previously
The U.S. in recent days has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Gulf region, plus four B-52 bombers. It also is moving a Patriot air-defense missile battery to an undisclosed country in the area. And on Sunday there were reports that four commercial vessels anchored off the United Arab Emirates had been damaged by sabotage.
What's next
A U.S. military team was sent to the UAE to investigate Sunday's attacks but has not yet reached a final conclusion on whether Iran is responsible. The Pentagon said it was sending another ship and a Patriot anti-missile battery to the Middle East. Meanwhile, multiple sources said Wednesday that top House and Senate leaders of both parties -- eight lawmakers in all -- would be briefed by the administration today on the fast-moving developments in the Middle East. There will be a larger briefing for all U.S. House members next week, which will include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a source familiar with the plans.

Texto completo: STURGEON BAY — Works by Nicole Herbst and John McCauley, two art teachers from Sturgeon Bay High School are being exhibited at the Hope Church Art Alcoves and will remain on display through June 10.
The Art Alcoves are located in Hope United Church of Christ, 141 S. 12th Street, Sturgeon Bay. Hours are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday through Friday and on Sundays. Private showings may be arranged by calling the Church Office at 920-743-2701.
Nicole Herbst is completing her 25th year teaching for Sturgeon Bay schools. Herbst's work focuses on inspiration from nature and the human figure. She loves the spontaneity of using mixed media as well as controlling the outcome. Herbst uses a layering method in painting, collage or digital art while trying to find how her subject will emerge through to show emphasis in the piece.
John McCauley's work is inspired by nature. It portrays the idea or sense of a "quiet strength" that is often overlooked. Nature is an environment that can be extremely overwhelming and yet incredibly serene, calm and relaxing. McCauley's work is a connection between the strong physical qualities of nature and the quiet, serene and calm.
Alan Kopischke is sole actor in TAP production opening Thursday STURGEON BAY — Third Avenue Playhouse will open its next production, "The Absolute Brightness of Leonard Pelkey," on Thursday May 16 at the playhouse, located at 239 North Third Ave., Sturgeon Bay.
Written by James Lecesne and directed by Robert Boles, the show will feature Door County favorite Alan Kopischke as the sole actor.
The play will continue through June 9 on Wednesday through Saturday evenings at 7:30 p.m. with Sunday matinee performances at 2 p.m. Tickets are $30 for adults and $12 for students. Tickets can be purchased online at thirdavenueplayhouse.com or at the theater's daytime box office at 234 N. Third Avenue, Sturgeon Bay, Tuesday through Friday from noon to 5 p.m.
A pay-as-you-can preview performance of the show will be presented tonight.
In "The Absolute Brightness of Leonard Pelkey," a detective unravels the story of Leonard Pelkey, a tenaciously optimistic and flamboyant 14-year-old boy who goes missing. The New Yorker called the show "A whodunit with a heart of gold."
"I read the play and fell in love with it immediately," Kopischke said. "Leonard (who I don't play) and all the people drawn into his orbit are such compelling characters. It's a story I want to tell and characters I want to embrace and hold within myself and share with the audience."
Peninsula band to present water-themed concert STURGEON BAY — The Peninsula Symphonic Community Band will perform a spring concert featuring water-themed musical pieces on Monday at 7 p.m. at the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church, 1756 Michigan Street, Sturgeon Bay.
Performance selections will include Handel's "Water Music" and music from "Victory at Sea" as well as "Pirates of the Caribbean," "Under the Sea" and more. Admission is free. A free will offering will be taken to support Healthy Water Door County.
Free screening of film 'We are Water' planned in Ephraim EPHRAIM — The Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Door County will offer a free public screening of the film "We are Water" on Tuesday May 21 at 4:30 p.m. at the fellowship, located at 10341 State 42 in Ephraim.
This documentary film gives a first-hand look at the complexity of water below the surface as Jill Heinerth, a renowned scuba diver, guides the viewer through various water environments.
Captain Jim Robinson will lead a discussion following the 53-minute film. Robinson started scuba diving in 1966 prior to any standard certification agencies. When formal certification agencies started, he became one of the early licensed dive instructors with Professional Association of Dive Instructors.
Robinson is currently a full cave diver with the National Association of Cave Diving and through the National Speleological Society/Cave Diving Section. He has been a Door County resident since 1976 and currently owns and operates Shoreline Scenic Cruises & Charters in Gills Rock.
The film screening is being offered in collaboration with Celebrate Water Door County and is part of the UUFDC's monthly Movies That Matter series that examines a wide range of issues.
Air Force musicians to perform at Door County Auditorium FISH CREEK — The USAF Band of Mid-America's Mobility Brass Quintet will present a concert at the Door Community Auditorium in Fish Creek on May 25 at 7 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public for this family-friendly, all-ages event.
Mobility Brass Quintet is the newest performing group of the United States Air Force Band of Mid-America. Featuring the traditional quintet instrumentation of two trumpets, French horn, trombone and tuba, the ensemble is known for its versatility and outstanding musicianship.
The quintet's performance repertoire spans five centuries from the glorious antiphonal sounds of the Renaissance to the rich diversity of American musical styles. Whether they are playing a military march, a jazz standard or an original arrangement of a patriotic favorite, the Mobility Brass Quintet's presentations are thoughtful, inspiring and entertaining.
The Door Community Auditorium is located at 3926 State 42 in Fish Creek. The box office is open Monday through Friday from noon to 5 p.m. More information is available by visiting the box office, calling 920-868-2728, or going to dcauditorium.org.

Texto completo: Ryan Reynolds is one of the hottest actors in Hollywood.
However, Reynolds said in a New York Times interview that he is not big on the vanity side of celebrity, saying his wife, Blake Lively, jokes about him only needing a drawer for his clothes rather than a closet.
Reynolds, who stars as the voice of Pikachu in the "Detective Pikachu" film opening this weekend, revealed that one of his favorite articles of clothing is a T-shirt — and it happens to be from Michigan.
"I have an old T-shirt that I've had for maybe 18 years," he told The New York Times. "It was black, but is gray now. And on the front it says Zukey Lake Tavern. I don't even know where that is, but it's a real tavern somewhere in the United States. I've had a couple of people say, 'No way! That's from my hometown.'"
Zukey Lake Tavern is in Pinckney, a village in Livingston County. The bar sells various kinds of merchandise in different styles and colors, such as tie-dye hoodies and T-shirts, tank tops, women's V-neck shirts and hoodies with phrases such as, "Zukey Lake Tavern, it's on the way to Hell, Michigan."
Zukey Lake even has a section on its website called, "ZLT Around the World," with people from Pittsburgh to Scotland donning a tavern shirt.
"We're honored and privileged to have our name out there," said Jeff Plante, co-owner of Zukey Lake Tavern.
"My partner and I are big fans of Ryan Reynolds. We even have a picture up of him wearing the shirt at the 'Smokin' Aces' premiere in 2007."
The tavern got its name from Zukey Lake, and was built after the end of Prohibition in the early 1930s by Maggie and Baldy Girard. The brothers also built several houses on the north shore of the lake, and the road where the tavern is located would be named after them, Girard Road.
In addition to its clothing, the bar is known for its roof deck tiki bar, "Lobster tail Tuesdays" and a Sunday breakfast buffet.
Plante said the tavern started selling retail in the early 1980s. Customers would get a free T-shirt when they ordered a large pizza.
Plante hopes to get in touch with Reynolds soon to offer him a new Zukey Lake Tavern T-shirt.

At new Spy Museum, cloaks and daggers galore

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The intelligence craft in American history and culture is a decidedly mixed bag.
It has served up intrigue, genius and heroism, clever undercover operations and brain-boggling gadgetry, making it a linchpin of popular entertainment.
Yet the spy trade also has a darker strain: Prone to epic failures and frequently in ethical trouble, the agencies have been embroiled in recent years in scandals involving brutal torture and secret surveillance.
Think Bond and Bourne vs. waterboarding and warrantless eavesdropping.
The challenge taken on by the new, vastly expanded International Spy Museum, which opened May 5 in a striking glass-and-steel building not far from the National Mall, was to capture all of these disparate threads.
The curators had to appeal to rambunctious 8-year-olds along with somber retirees, tourists whose notion of intelligence comes from "The Spy Who Loved Me" and (given its location) hypercritical visitors from the ranks of the CIA, the National Security Agency and all the secret crannies of the security state.
Overall, the new museum, built for $162 million from private donations and a municipal bond, does a remarkable job. It is more serious and realistic than the original Spy Museum, located 1 mile away and founded by the same man who financed most of the new museum, Milton Maltz, a television and radio entrepreneur.
During its run from 2002 to 2018, the old museum became a popular gathering place for authors and speakers on spying, but some of the displays came across as slick and superficial.
The new exhibits use every technological trick in the modern-museum book to engage visitors. But they also are designed to present complex subjects in ways that encourage thoughtful consideration and debate. The museum is rich with historical artifacts, interactive quizzes and original short films.
Most impressively, the new Spy Museum faces squarely the most painful and divisive episodes in the recent history of American spying. A room devoted to interrogation and torture features some history (George Washington took a stand against the mistreatment of British prisoners) and an actual waterboard - the notorious torture device used in the Inquisition, by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia and by the CIA against al-Qaida suspects in 2002 and 2003.
In accompanying video clips, two architects of the CIA's "enhanced interrogation techniques" defend them as necessary and effective; a military lawyer, a Navy trainer and others denounce them as useless and starkly at odds with American and civilized values.
In another room, devoted to secrecy and openness, among those who speak in extensive footage are Thomas Drake, a former NSA official prosecuted for leaking to the press about a wasteful, failed program; and Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who advises Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor who gave journalists hundreds of thousands of secret documents. Senior intelligence officials also get their say, but they do not monopolize the discussion.
The museum takes a forthright look, too, at intelligence failures, dissecting the catastrophically mistaken estimates about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and pairing the attacks on Pearl Harbor and on Sept. 11, 2001, in illuminating ways. A creepy set of rooms depicts East Berlin as a surveillance society gone out of control.
"Here, we cover the dark side," said Anna Slafer, the museum's vice president of exhibitions and programs. In the old museum, she said, "We didn't really address controversy. It was spy-lite." Given the fierce debates and moral quandaries in the news since 9/11, such an approach was no longer defensible, she said.
Of course, if the old museum was "lite," this one is not by any means all heavy. There are hundreds of items from the unrivaled spy-artifact collection of H. Keith Melton, who has advised the CIA on historical matters and donated his finds to the museum.
There's a Soviet camera hidden in a glasses case, an East German microdot message in a hollow tooth, a fake-pregnancy suit for female CIA spies and a fake scrotum concealing a transmitter for the men. There are excursions into the huge place of spying in popular culture, but fictional stories are not allowed to predominate.
In keeping with the "international" in its name, the new museum seeks to expand beyond the American and British experience. Among the spies whose stories are told in detail are ones from China, Russia and Israel. A Danish former jihadi, Morten Storm, recounts his terrifying adventures infiltrating al-Qaida in Yemen.
Few movies are built around the work of intelligence analysis. But the museum manages to bring the subject vividly to life with an elaborate presentation of the puzzle CIA analysts faced at the end of the hunt for Osama bin Laden: Was the man living behind the walls of the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the al-Qaida founder? Or was it the home of a crime boss, a drug kingpin or a reclusive businessman?
Visitors watch Michael Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA, present the known facts on video. A model of the compound lights up to indicate clues: A balcony is surrounded by a high wall; trash is burned rather than put out for collection; a tall man paces the grounds.
At another station, amateurs can assess the social media posts of a suspected terrorist, trying their hand at a daily challenge for the FBI and CIA: Is the person a mere blowhard and fantasist? Or does he really pose a threat of violence?
At some two dozen interactive displays, each visitor, identified by an electronic identification card worn on a lanyard, can test their skills at spycraft. At the end of their tour - about 2½ hours on average, curators predict - visitors get a sort of report card on their aptitude for various intelligence specialties. They can follow up on a website for a more detailed "debrief."
That will strike some people as hokey - and others as cool. The museum, about halfway between the mall and Washington's waterfront, seeks to serve all comers, staking its claim to become a must-stop attraction for the hordes of tourists who land in the capital every year. Though the museum is a nonprofit, it's pricey, in the way of new museums - $24.95 per adult ($2 off for online purchases), with discounts for seniors, military members and children.

Russia and the 5G Cancer Scare; America's cell-phone industry couldn't be happier about the Kremlin's meddling.

Texto completo: Above the fold on the front page of the New York Times, by the paper's seasoned science reporter, William Broad, came a story that could only have the cell-phone industry saying "yippee."
RT, the Moscow-backed, U.S.-based television network that U.S. intelligence identified as a "principal meddler in the 2016 presidential election," is promoting for U.S. audiences a claim that 5G wireless is a menace to public health, causing "brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer's disease."
"It's economic warfare," a source told the paper. "Russia doesn't have a good 5G play, so it tries to undermine and discredit ours."
Splashy national news stories often are not as original as they seem. A tech news site, Fudzilla, so unprepossessing that it recently fought a battle with Wikipedia over whether it deserved an entry, was already on the story months ago, and provided useful context: Conspiratorial websites, including that of Infowars impresario Alex Jones, have been pushing 5G alarmism for more than a year. All have been playing off decades of activist scare-mongering that has underlain so much opposition around the country to cellphone towers, power lines and even airport landing systems.
This noise brigade all stems, in a sense, from the same august source: a series of articles published by the New Yorker magazine in the late 1980s and early 1990s alleging a massive coverup of health effects of non-ionizing radiation produced by many kinds of electrical appliances.
A cottage industry has been with us ever since. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the U.S. government disallowed health claims as a reason to block cellphone towers. Yet last year its own National Toxicology Program produced a $25 million study showing that a small percentage of male (but not female) rodents developed a certain type of cancer when bathed in 2G and 3G emissions for an extended period.
The respectable left-wing magazine the Nation produced a lengthy article last year accusing industry and government of a 5G coverup. A group of scientists and technologists calling themselves the 5G Appeal demands a moratorium on deployment. As far back as 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which considers everything a cancer risk until proven otherwise, decided cellphone use was a possible carcinogen.
For the sake of having a complete record, this column once urged a hunt for a Russian role in promoting the 9/11 truther and Obama birther conspiracies. In 2014, the head of NATO candidly accused Russia of backing the anti-fracking efforts of environmentalists. And yet does anybody think these hobby horses would not have sustained themselves without Russia's help?
Not only will the Kremlin's anti-5G efforts likely be devoid of influence, they will be a boon to those pushing back. The Times story is valuable precisely for showing how easily Russia's efforts can be neutralized just by calling attention to them.
Alas, a new cottage industry has been born—devoted to exaggerating the competence and potency of Russian propaganda tactics. And it's hard not to see a connection to the grand illusion that continues to animate America's media and political firmament, namely that Trump voters were fooled into pulling the lever for him.
For the third time since it tried to inject an October surprise before Election Day in 2016, the New York Times last week unleashed another "investigation" of Mr. Trump's tax history that amounts to yet another least-interesting version of the most-told story about Mr. Trump—his debt-fueled meltdown of the early 1990s.
Immediately pilot fish at the New Yorker, Slate and other publications rushed out pieces calling Mr. Trump "the worst businessman in America" and a "reckless conman who burned money."
We'll spare you the details. Unlike many businesses, Mr. Trump ran his losses through his personal tax return. That's the sole basis for the paper's excited claim that he "lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer." The same 1990-91 recession that nearly took down Mr. Trump also nearly took down Rupert Murdoch's burgeoning Fox media empire. It sank two of the country's biggest regional banks, Security Pacific and Bank of New England, as well as other enterprises whose losses mostly appeared on corporate, rather than personal, income statements.
Mr. Trump wasn't the first and won't be the last to seek billionairehood by owning businesses on credit. Though it won't earn any business hagiographies, his resurrection, by peddling himself as a gold-plated wheeler-dealer, was also some kind of feat, leading to his NBC show and the presidency.
We in the press fool ourselves if we think the public needs to be disabused about his history. Mr. Trump was the most known presidential candidate ever. And soon, of course, voters will have even more relevant data to inform their 2020 vote: four years of a Trump presidency.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The House Intelligence Committee is investigating whether lawyers for President Trump and his family sought to obstruct the panel's Russia investigation, including by editing a false statement former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen made to the committee in 2017.
In a March 14 letter to attorneys for four lawyers representing the president, his family members and the Trump Organization, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) sought documents related to any drafts of or communications about Mr. Cohen's 2017 statement, as well as records about any discussions of a pardon or "pre-pardon" related to Mr. Cohen and nearly a dozen other Trump associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former national security adviser Mike Flynn and the president's son-in-law and daughter, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
"Among other things, it appears that your clients may have reviewed, shaped and edited the false Statement that Cohen submitted to the Committee, including causing the omission of material facts," Mr. Schiff wrote in a subsequent letter to the attorneys for the lawyers. "In addition, certain of your clients may have engaged in discussions about potential pardons in an effort to deter one or more witnesses from cooperating with authorized investigations."
The four lawyers—Jay Sekulow, who represents the president; Alan Garten, who represents the Trump Organization; Alan Futerfas, who represents Donald Trump Jr., the president's son; and Abbe Lowell, who represents Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump—have so far declined to cooperate with the committee's requests, asking the panel to provide a "jurisdictional basis" for its requests in a letter sent April 5.
Patrick Strawbridge, who represents Mr. Sekulow, said in a statement on behalf of the four Trump lawyers Tuesday: "Instead of addressing important intelligence needs, the House Intelligence Committee appears to seek a truly needless dispute — this one with private attorneys — that would force them to violate privileges and ethical rules."
Mr. Sekulow, following Mr. Cohen's February testimony, said any assertion that the president's lawyers had edited his statement to change his description of when the project negotiations ended was "completely false."
Mr. Schiff will issue a subpoena to compel their cooperation if necessary, a senior committee official said. The committee's investigation was first reported by the New York Times.
The request from the House Intelligence Committee marks another front in the battle between the White House and Congress. Mr. Trump and his lawyers have sought to block congressional inquiries on multiple fronts, including for his tax returns, his financial statements, documents related to the administration's security-clearance process and testimony by his eldest son, Mr. Trump Jr.
Special counsel Robert Mueller, who as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election examined whether the president sought to obstruct the investigation, gathered evidence of the president's lawyers' involvement in shaping Mr. Cohen's congressional testimony in 2017 and decided not to bring charges.
Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress in 2017 in what he said was an effort to minimize Mr. Trump's role in efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign. Among the lies he told the committee were that discussions for the project ended in January 2016, when in fact they continued through at least June of that year , and that he "never considered asking" Mr. Trump to travel to Russia for the project, when in fact he both asked the candidate to do so and consulted a senior campaign official about it.
In testimony before the House Oversight Committee in February, Mr. Cohen said that personal lawyers for the president "reviewed and edited" his statement and that he met with the president and Mr. Sekulow at the White House before his 2017 testimony.
Mr. Mueller wrote in his report that an early draft of Mr. Cohen's congressional statement included the line: "The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian government officials." That line was removed in the final version.
Mr. Cohen also told investigators that a lawyer for the president advised him not to include mention of a meeting he proposed between Messrs. Trump and Putin in September 2015.
Mr. Cohen and his representatives have also said they felt lawyers for the president "dangled" a pardon in the months after Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided Mr. Cohen's home, office and hotel room in April 2018. Mr. Cohen—despite telling the House Oversight Committee in February that he never sought a pardon— last spring directed his attorney to inquire about the possibility of a pardon with lawyers for the president, including Mr. Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani and Joanna Hendon.
The lawyers dismissed the possibility of a pardon, but Mr. Giuliani said he has told every lawyer who approached him about pardons for their client: "The president is not going to consider any pardons at this time, and nobody should think that he is"—but that "whatever happens in the future, that is his prerogative."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will campaign for a Pennsylvania congressional candidate and tout his administration's economic achievements at a rally Monday in Lycoming County in the northeastern part of the state.
Mr. Trump's rally will begin at 7 p.m. at the Energy Aviation Hangar in Montoursville, a town about 60 miles west of Wilkes-Barre. The president will offer his support for Republican state Rep. Fred Keller in his bid for an open congressional seat there.
The president's visit likely will boost Mr. Keller's chances of winning the special election May 21 for the 12th District, which voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 by more than a 2-1 margin over Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Keller faces Democrat Marc Friedenberg. The winner will serve the remainder of Tom Marino's term. Mr. Marino resigned in January, citing health reasons.
Earlier this month, Mr. Trump tweeted his endorsement of Mr. Keller, asserting that the state legislator is "Strong on Crime, Second Amendment, Military, Vets and Healthcare."
At his first-ever rally in Montoursville, Mr. Trump, who is running for a second term in the White House in 2020, will "share his long litany of achievements" - including the creation of nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs since he took office, according to a campaign release.
Mr. Trump hasn't rallied in Pennsylvania since October, when he traveled to Erie to praise the large slate of Republican candidates running in the midterms.

Texto completo: FOND DU LAC - When Maureen Daly felt the pangs and excitement of first love at the age of 17, she took to her basement desk to scrawl it down. While fictionalizing the experience, she also wrote about what she knew: teenage romance blossoming in the town in which she lived. The places she and her three sisters had made their playground during the Great Depression became settings — Lakeside Park and its lighthouse; McKnight's Drug Store on Main Street.
At the time, Daly didn't know that four years later her pages of experience would be published as "Seventeenth Summer," a novel credited with honestly depicting love in adolescence, spurring the young adult genre, and immortalizing Fond du Lac locales in the minds of more than one million readers.
Fond du Lac County Historical Society and Historic Preservation Commission of the City of Fond du Lac will celebrate Daly, her life and its impact on Fond du Lac's history as part of National Historic Preservation Month Wednesday. Titled "Maureen Daly Day," the event will invite the public to learn more about Daly's story as they discuss the evolution in dating norms over Cherry Cokes.
Celebrating a Fond du Lac author For the past couple of years, the society and commission have come together to host an event that sheds light on the importance of preserving local history as part of National Historic Preservation Month. Last year, the event focused on changes to wedding and engagement customs over the past 150 years in Wisconsin, said Fond du Lac County Executive Director Vanessa VanderWeele.
When it came to selecting a subject for this year's event, Daly was a perfect fit, because of the number of people who grew up reading her work in the city and the ability to discuss Fond du Lac's history through it, said VanderWeele.
The selection allows for the event to not focus on "physical buildings" that serve as "architectural treasures" in the community's history, but on the city's people as well, said Community Development Director Dyann Benson, who also acts as the staff liaison to the commission.
"We also need to celebrate the people that contributed to who we are as a community," Benson said. "Maureen Daly shared Fond du Lac with the outside world through her book 'Seventeenth Summer.'"
Daly and her family left Ireland and came to the United States in the 1920s and settled in a home on Bank Street. As she grew, she attended St. Mary's Springs, where her teacher, Sister Rosita Handibode, of the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Agnes, encouraged her to write. At age 15, she took fourth place for her submission to a Scholastic Magazine national contest for her story "Fifteen," according to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
The next year, she submitted "Sixteen," a short story that involves two teens meeting at a skating rink. For the story, she won first prize, and it was selected to appear in the "O'Henry Best Short Stories," according to archives. Since it has appeared in various textbooks and anthologies.
At the age of 17, the summer brought time off from school, and Daly decided to write a novel. Over the warm months, she wrote a few chapters and an outline of the story of Angie Morrow and Jack Duluth, two Fond du Lac teens who fall in love over a summer against the backdrop of Lakeside Park, the Rathskeller and Pete Mengl's.
The places are ones that anyone from the time period would've recognized and still stand today, said VanderWeele. One is McKnight's Drug Store — now Annie's Fountain City Café. The eatery will host the first part of the Maureen Daly Day event at 6 p.m. Wednesday, and serve up a favorite drink of the time period — Cherry Coke — as well as other treats. As guests enjoy the food, they will also listen to a panel that will discuss the changes in dating from the 1940s to the social media age, said VanderWeele.
"The way we define dating has changed immensely since then," she said. "With the panel, we're seeing how dating has changed since going from meeting up at the corner store to swiping left and right on the dating app."
As Daly went on to college, the story stayed with her, and as a senior at Rosary College, she entered the novel into the Dodd, Mead's inter-collegiate fellowship contest, according to The New York Times and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
The novel was praised by critics when published in 1942, and over the years found its way to schools throughout the country. Although written for adults, the book spoke to teenagers and "anticipated the young-adult genre by decades," said The New York Times. Its resonance with people of all ages is seen in the fact the book has never gone out of print and has sold more than 1 million copies, as well as been printed in a dozen languages, according to Daly in USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
Daly said in a Fond du Lac Reporter column about writing the book: "It was a sheer outburst of creative yearning and emotional hype. I loved that town (and several of the young men in it) and wanted to express myself and my feelings at that time."
Despite this, Daly did not return to writing novels about teens until the 1980s.
"She didn't see her book as a huge success at the time," said VanderWeele.
Instead, after graduating from college, Daly turned to journalism for a sustainable career. She began writing for the Chicago Tribune, contributing a teen advice column to the paper, said VanderWeele. Her sister, Shelia, later took over the column and became a nationally syndicated columnist herself, as well as a vice president at Chanel.
As for her other sisters, Maggie became a model, and later a columnist, according to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives. Kay became an advertising executive for Revlon, creating the "Fire and Ice" campaign, which was one of the first to promote women wearing makeup for themselves and not to attract men, said VanderWeele.
Past the Chicago Tribune, Daly's career continued to blossom as she became the Ladies' Home Journal executive editor and, later, editorial adviser for The Saturday Evening Post, according to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives.
Post-World War II, Daly married writer William McGivern, whom she met an "Seventeenth Summer" autographing event. The two took to Europe, where they did freelance writing, raised two children, Megan and Patrick, and wrote the book "Mention My Name is Mombasa: The Unscheduled Adventures of an American Family Abroad," according to the archives and The New York Times.
In her time abroad, Daly also interviewed some of the world's major players, like President Harry Truman, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Andy Warhol, according to the Publishers Weekly.
When the children were teenagers, Daly and her family returned to the United States and built a home in Pennsylvania. Although the state would come to inspire her novels, it wouldn't do so until after a series of tragedies.
In 1983, McGivern died of cancer; in 1984, Megan did as well. Sitting down to write again, Daly wanted to write about her daughter, but couldn't do so without crying. For inspiration, she turned to her daughter's happier years, when at 16 she fell in love with a cowboy in Pennsylvania, as the state tried to build a highway through their property. The result, "Acts of Love," was her first novel in more than 40 years, according to archives.
More works followed, including an "Acts of Love" sequel, "First a Dream," prior to her own death from cancer in 2006, according to The New York Times.
An impactful life on display These aspects of her life, and more, will be showcased during the second part of the Maureen Daly Day event at 7 p.m. at the Galloway House and Village's Blakely Museum. There, an actress portraying Daly will share her story, and show visitors to the desk on which she wrote the influential book "Seventeenth Summer." Signed first-editions will also be displayed.
Benson said: "This month's event will, hopefully, bring Daly and her work to another generation as well as provide an opportunity for people to revisit their experiences, whether it was about reading the book, or living in the city at that time. It's a different type of chapter in how we typically celebrate historic preservation."

Attend Maureen Daly Day beginning at 6 p.m. at Annie's Fountain City Café, 72 S. Main St., Fond du Lac. The event will continue at 7 p.m. at Galloway House and Village, 336 Old Pioneer Road.
As part of National Historic Preservation Month and Museum Week, tours of the Blakley Museum will be given throughout the week. Tour times are listed online at fdlhistory.com.

What's next for Philly's 76ers?

Texto completo: Brown had his playoff starting five — Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick — for 10 regular-season games.
TORONTO — The Process is dead. Long live the process.
Asked where The Process is at this stage of his career, Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid — dejected from losing to Toronto, 92-90 in Game 7 on Sunday — said, "I don't give a damn about The Process."
Quite the admission from Embiid, who came to embody the Sixers' divisive rebuild set forth by former general manager Sam Hinkie.
Regardless whether Embiid uttered his comment in the disappointment of defeat or if that's how he really feels, the Sixers have reached a critical moment in this era.
Where do they go from here? Who is the coach and who is on the team at the start of the 2019-20 season?
General manager Elton Brand has proven himself in his first season in the job following the Bryan Colangelo Twitter disgrace that resulted in Colangelo losing his job.
Brand acquired Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris in trades during the season, but the work gets more difficult, starting with what happens to Coach Brett Brown.
The New York Times reported that it will be difficult for Brown to save his job if the Sixers didn't advance to the conference finals. Ownership is on record saying the Sixers have the talent to beat anyone in the East, and Brand told reporters in April the goal was to get deeper in the playoffs than last season, which was a second-round exit, the same as this season.
Does Brown take the fall for that? Basing his future on an incredible buzzer-beater by Kawhi Leonard in a Game 7 seems short-sighted.
Brown had his playoff starting five — Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick — for 10 regular-season games. He had to coach three iterations of 2018-19 Sixers: the team he had at a training camp, the team he had after the Sixers traded for Butler in November and the team he had when the Sixers acquired Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers in February.
A case can be made for bringing Brown back. But if the Sixers don't think he is the coach to get them to the next level, that's their prerogative. But it shouldn't be based on the outcome of a single Game 7 result on the road.
If Philadelphia makes a coaching change, Brand better have his replacement ready to go — like Toronto president Masai Ujiri replaced Dwane Casey with Nick Nurse following last season's playoff exit. If not, this has the potential to backfire.
The Sixers need to resolve that then focus on their roster. Jimmy Butler likely will become a free agent and Tobias Harris will be a free agent. Do those two want to come back, and at what price and length of contract? Giving up what they did in trades to get those two indicates they are willing spend to keep both.
A third starter, J.J. Redick, is also a free agent along with Mike Scott, Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe and Boban Marjanovic. Because Philadelphia has several young players on team friendly contracts, the Sixers have money to spend in free agency.
In the draft, the Sixers have one first-round pick and three second-round picks. While the draft is important, it's far less so compared to the coaching situation and free agency.
It's one of the more intriguing offseason story lines: how do the Sixers take the next step of their development? How do they become a championship contender?
It's a process, that's for sure, and it's in Elton Brand's hands.
Brown had his playoff starting five — Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick — for 10 regular-season games.

U.S. News: Rosenstein Slams Comey as 'Partisan Pundit,' Says Firing Justified

Texto completo: Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein kicked off post-government life by slamming former FBI Director James Comey, calling him a "partisan pundit" whose firing was justified.
Speaking to a group of city officials in Baltimore on Monday, his second day as a private citizen, Mr. Rosenstein defended a memo he wrote in May 2017, which the White House initially cited as grounds for ousting Mr. Comey. As the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Comey was leading its probe into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian election interference.
"I do not blame the former director for being angry," Mr. Rosenstein said, according to prepared remarks that offered his fullest public accounting yet of his views on Mr. Comey's firing. "But now the former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul. That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors."
It was the latest volley in an unusual, public back-and-forth between Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Comey, who said in a scathing New York Times opinion piece this month that the deputy attorney general lacked the inner strength needed to "resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump."
Mr. Comey didn't respond to requests for comment Monday.
President Trump's unceremonious dismissal of Mr. Comey became a focal point of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the president obstructed justice. Within days, Mr. Trump said in an NBC interview he had the Russia investigation on his mind when he decided to fire Mr. Comey. Mr. Rosenstein named Mr. Mueller special counsel less than a week later.
"I determined that I needed a special counsel to help resolve the election-interference investigation in a way that would best protect America from foreign adversaries and preserve public confidence in the long run," Mr. Rosenstein said Monday.

Condé Nast in Deal to Sell Golf Digest for $35 Million

Texto completo: Condé Nast has sold Golf Digest to Discovery Inc., the companies said on Monday, as the publisher of The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Vogue sheds titles amid recent losses related to the decline of the magazine business.
Neither company disclosed terms of the deal, but two people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly said the sale price was $ 35 million.
Discovery said that it would retain Golf Digest's editorial staff, including its top editor, Jerry Tarde, and would continue to publish the monthly print magazine. The company also said Mr. Tarde would be the global head of strategy and content for Discovery Golf, a unit that includes the digital platform GolfTV, which live-streams professional golf tournaments for audiences outside the United States.
"As we look to the future, Discovery's global scale and ability to light up content on all platforms and in every language, combined with the PGA Tour's brand, will benefit golf and golfers worldwide," Mr. Tarde said in a statement.
Condé Nast acquired Golf Digest, which is known for, among other things, its rankings of the top 100 golf courses, from The New York Times Company in 2000 and put the magazine up for sale last August, along with Brides and the fashion glossy W.
The sale of the publication is the first major change for Condé Nast under its new chief executive, Roger J. Lynch, a technology industry veteran who succeeded Robert A. Sauerberg Jr. last month.
The company, which is owned by Advance Publications, had losses of more than $ 100 million in 2017. Some of its titles, including Glamour and Teen Vogue, have gone digital only. The once-cushy publisher has also laid off employees and leased out floor space at its 1 World Trade Center offices in Manhattan in an effort to cut costs.
David Zaslav, Discovery's president and chief executive, said the acquisition of Golf Digest would enhance the company's international and "multiplatform" offerings related to golf, a sport with a largely affluent fan base.
"It's a natural strategic fit with Discovery's goal to be the leading golf media platform in the world," he said in a statement.
Discovery, which owns the Discovery Channel, HGTV, Animal Planet and other cable networks, already holds carriage rights to the PGA Tour in markets outside the United States, including Canada, Italy and Japan. It also has a content deal with Tiger Woods, whose victory at the Masters last month was his first major tournament win in more than a decade.
Mr. Woods was a Golf Digest contributor for more than a decade, with his byline appearing on columns like "Try My 4-Iron Chip Shot" and "Stay Tall in Fairway Bunkers" until the arrangement ended in 2011.
Mr. Tarde, who started at Golf Digest as an intern in 1977, referred to Discovery's broader strategy in an email to staff Monday morning.
"The short-term plan," he said, "is to keep doing what you're doing: Create great content, keep growing digital, engage users on all platforms."

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr has tapped the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut to study the origins of a 2016 counterintelligence investigation that conducted what he has called "spying" on people affiliated with the Trump campaign, a person familiar with the decision said.
John Durham, Connecticut's U.S. attorney, is helping Mr. Barr look at the early stages of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe of the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia, which included surveillance and was later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr. Durham, who has experience investigating abuses by national-security officials, will help evaluate whether the government's intelligence-gathering efforts in the early stages of the probe were legal and appropriate, this person said.
His work marks the third ongoing investigation—including one being conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general—of law-enforcement actions in connection with the 2016 counterintelligence probe. President Trump's Republican allies have long alleged that his associates were unfairly targeted for surveillance, and that investigators in the Justice Department and the FBI were politically prejudiced against Mr. Trump in a way that could have affected their work. FBI Director Christopher Wray and other officials have defended the bureau's work.
Other details of Mr. Barr's review are scarce. The Justice Department didn't immediately comment. Mr. Durham's involvement in the matter was first reported by the New York Times.
Mr. Durham was nominated by Mr. Trump in 2017 after a long career as a federal prosecutor in both Republican and Democratic administrations, focusing on organized crime, public corruption and financial fraud.
During the Clinton administration, Attorney General Janet Reno asked Mr. Durham to probe the FBI's use of organized-crime figure Whitey Bulger as an informant.
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey chose Mr. Durham in 2008 to investigate the destruction of videotapes made of certain CIA interrogations of terrorism suspects overseas during the Bush administration. Under President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder asked Mr. Durham to go further, looking into whether CIA officials or contractors broke the law in its treatment of detainees.
Mr. Barr stirred criticism when he said last month that he would be forming a team of officials to examine the origins of the Russia probe, using language that Democrats said was politically motivated and echoed Mr. Trump's own criticism of the investigation.
"Spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated," Mr. Barr said at the time.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Justice Department's inspector general, close to concluding its inquiry, is homing in on whether the agency continued surveillance of one associate , former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, despite questions about a key source's credibility, according to people familiar with the matter.
A third investigation is being run by Utah's U.S. attorney, John Huber. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed him in November 2017 to determine whether a second special counsel was needed to investigate a number of Republican grievances involving the FBI and Justice Department about the surveillance of Mr. Page.

Rod Rosenstein Slams Former FBI Director James Comey in Speech; Former deputy attorney general calls Comey a 'partisan pundit,' the latest volley in public back-and-forth between the two men

Texto completo: Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein kicked off post-government life by slamming former FBI Director James Comey, calling him a "partisan pundit" whose firing was justified.
Speaking to a group of city officials in Baltimore on Monday, his second day as a private citizen, Mr. Rosenstein defended a memo he wrote in May 2017, which the White House initially cited as grounds for ousting Mr. Comey. As the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Comey was leading its probe into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian election interference.
"I do not blame the former director for being angry," Mr. Rosenstein said, according to prepared remarks that offered his fullest public accounting yet of his views on Mr. Comey's firing. "But now the former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul. That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors. Generally we base our opinions on eyewitness testimony."
It was the latest volley in an unusual, public back-and-forth between Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Comey, who said in a scathing New York Times opinion piece this month that the deputy attorney general lacked the inner strength needed to "resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump."
Mr. Comey didn't respond to requests for comment Monday.
President Trump's unceremonious dismissal of Mr. Comey became a focal point of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the president obstructed justice . Within days, Mr. Trump said in an NBC interview he had the Russia investigation on his mind when he decided to fire Mr. Comey. Mr. Rosenstein named Mr. Mueller special counsel less than a week later, saying the public interest demanded such a drastic move.
"I recognized that the unusual circumstances of the firing and the ensuing developments would give reasonable people cause to speculate about the credibility of the investigation," Mr. Rosenstein said Monday, defending his decision, which defined the course of his tumultuous time as the Justice Department's No. 2 official. "I determined that I needed a special counsel to help resolve the election-interference investigation in a way that would best protect America from foreign adversaries and preserve public confidence in the long run."
He said, "based on what I knew in May 2017, the investigation of Russian election interference was justified, and closing it was not an option."
The department's inspector general is investigating whether law-enforcement officials overstepped their authority in the early stages of the Russia probe, including some actions overseen by Mr. Rosenstein. If that probe uncovers significant new facts, Mr. Rosenstein said he would reconsider that opinion "but I always need to base my opinions on credible evidence."
Mr. Rosenstein left the Justice Department Saturday after nearly 30 years, including two as deputy attorney general, in which he tried to steady the rocky agency and boost its relationship with the White House . It didn't always work. In September, his departure seemed all but certain following reports that he had suggested secretly recording the president and sought his removal from office, measures Mr. Rosenstein strongly denied.
His successor, deputy transportation secretary Jeffrey Rosen, is awaiting confirmation .
In his waning days on the job, Mr. Rosenstein tore into Obama officials, the news media and political pundits, saying he was right to appoint Mr. Mueller.
"I think I made the right decision," Mr. Rosenstein said Monday. "I respect anybody's right to disagree, but in fairness, critics should explain what they would have done with the details we knew at the time, and consider how things might have progressed and how long it might have taken."
The special counsel's investigation didn't find that the Trump campaign conspired with Mosow's election interference, but came to no conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice . Without a recommendation, Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General William Barr determined Mr. Trump's actions didn't rise to the level of a crime .
Mr. Comey's firing was an early test of the apolitical reputation Mr. Rosenstein cultivated while serving as Maryland's U.S. attorney under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Mr. Rosenstein pressed the White House to correct what he felt was an inaccurate depiction of his role in Mr. Comey's firing.
On Monday, the former deputy attorney general said he stood by his memo, which criticized Mr. Comey's handling of the Hilary Clinton email probe. Mr. Rosenstein said he would have handled Mr. Comey's firing "with more respect and far less drama," however.
"People spend a lot of time debating whose side I was on, based on who seemed to benefit most from any individual decision" to appoint Mr. Mueller, he said. "That is because partisans evaluate things in terms of the immediate political impact, and cable TV pundits fill a lot of time by pretending there is always serious breaking news. But trying to infer partisanship from law enforcement decisions is a category error. It uses the wrong frame of reference."
Mr. Rosenstein added: "My soul and character are pretty much the same today as they were two years ago. I took a few hits and made some enemies during my time in the arena, but I held my ground and made a lot of friends. And thanks to them, I think I made the right calls on the things that mattered."

Camden residents seek more jobs from tax breaks

Texto completo: In the midst of intensifying scrutiny into New Jersey's corporate tax incentive programs, a small group of activists met Thursday in the shadow of a gleaming new office tower going up on Camden's waterfront.
The building will serve as the headquarters for three companies that won a combined $245 million in tax breaks to move to Camden. In just the past six years, the state has awarded a total of $1.6 billion in tax breaks to companies that promised to help create or retain jobs in the city.
But the activists said not enough of those jobs are going to Camden residents. They called on the companies to release data on minority hiring and beef up training programs. They also said city officials should write minority set-asides into the construction contracts for the new offices.
"It's all about having access," said Bryan McAllister, a pastor at Bethel AME Church in south Camden. "And I think that's really what the people here in Camden are really asking for. They're asking for access. If the city's going to turn around, like, don't leave us out."
Among the future tenants of the waterfront office towerwill be insurance brokerage firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, whose executive chairman, George Norcross, is at the center of an escalating feud with Gov. Phil Murphy oyer how many of the tax breaks were handed out.
Norcross is considered one of the most influential non-elected Democratic figures in New Jersey. But recent reporting from WNYC and ProPublica, and from The New York Times, has cast a negative light on the role he and people in his orbit played in funneling money to Camden.
Of the $1.6 billion in tax credits awarded to Camden, for example, Norcross and his associates were tied to about two-thirds of them.
Following an audit that harshly criticized a state authority's oversight of the tax incentive programs, Murphy, also a Democrat, appointed a task force that has been investigating whether companies misled the state to win tax breaks. The task force has already made one criminal referral and has begun clawing back money from at least one company.
Norcross lashed out in an interview last week with reporters for NJ.com, calling Murphy a "liar" and "politically incompetent" and suggesting Murphy would face a primary challenger should he run for re-election in 2021.
"He thinks he's the King of England and Mrs. thinks she's the Queen of England, and they don't have to answer to anybody," Norcross said in the interview, referring to Murphy and first lady Tammy Murphy, who has been a public face for her husband's agenda.
"Very hard as an Irishman to be referred to as the King of England," Murphy, quipped Thursday when asked about the comments. He added that the administration's review of the tax incentive programs is not politically motivated.
"Nobody's getting attacked here," he said. "In fact, I'm going to say what I've said before, that when we're said and done, whenever that is, we will have done more for Camden and communities like Camden than any other administration in the history of the state. And it will work for everyone, not just for some."
New Jersey's current incentive programs are due to expire at the end of June, but there's no consensus in Trenton on whether to renew or revamp them.
In total, New Jersey has awarded $11 billion in tax breaks - including $8 billion under Murphy's predecessor, Republican Chris Christie.
Only a fraction of that amount has been paid out. Companies must hit certain job or investment targets before they receive the credits.
Camden boosters respond
In response to the complaints of the activists, Camden County Freeholder Director Lou Cappelli said Thursday that most of what they are asking for is already happening.
He pointed to a slew of specialized job-training programs for Camden residents that have been set up through collaborations with the companies and state and local officials.
"The trade unions have also made a very good effort to recruit city residents into apprenticeship programs," he added. "So the folks today just either choose to ignore those facts or aren't in the know."
Companies that win tax breaks aren't required to report their local hiring, so it's hard to get a clear picture of who's benefiting from Camden's development boom.
A January report commissioned by the Rowan University/Rutgers-Camden board of governors said that among the major companies that have received tax credits, about 11% of workers are Camden residents.
There certainly are some companies committed to hiring locally.
Joe Balzano, CEO of EMR USA, a scrap metal recycling company, attended Rutgers-Camden as a student, and his parents grew up in the city. So when EMR was awarded $133 million in tax credits to expand in Camden, Balzano said it was important to give back to a community where his family has deep roots.
About 40% to 50% of his workers there are Camden residents, he said, and his workforce is still growing. That equates to nearly 200 residents, including more than 120 in newly created positions.
"These are teamster jobs for the most part. They're full medical benefits, retirement plans. These are jobs that really were the mainstay of Camden 50 years ago,"he said. "So it's very important [for us to hire locally]."
However, some of the most high-profile companies were mainly moving employees from elsewhere in New Jersey. And notably, Holtec International has struggled to hire and retain Camden residents.
One of those gathered on the waterfront Thursday was Kevin Barfield, president of the Camden County NAACP. He said he was happy to see all the new investment in Camden but wanted more transparency from companies and the city to make sure minorities were getting jobs both inside the new facilities and on construction sites.
"My thing is clarity," Barfield said. "If you do have that, then produce that information, because we don't see that." - (WHYY)

Stop the spread of hate

Texto completo: Anti-Semitism is hatred of Jews as a people, a race, an ethnic group. Anti-Zionism is objection to a country, a nation, a state. Anti-Semitism is a virus that mutates so the new anti-Semites can deny they are anti-Semites at all, because their hate is different from the old. In the Middle Ages, Jews were hated for their religion. In the 19th and early 20th century, they were hated for their race. Today they are hated for their nation-state, Israel.
There is a connection between Jews as a people, Judaism as a religion and Israel as a state that goes back more than 3,000 years. Jews are the only people who ever created a nation-state there. That is why anti-Zionism, denying Jews the right to their one home by misrepresenting Judaism, is the new anti-Semitism.
Social media needs to regulate the right of free speech when it becomes toxic hate that lead to acts of violence. Recently, Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza fired 700 rockets at Israel. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., slammed the New York Times headline as being initiated from Gaza. There is nothing wrong with making policy concerns about Israel or thinking others in the political process are wrong. The pattern of using specific language that marginalizes and stigmatizes others' participation in the political process that is creating any unsafe climate is a legitimate concern.
Their remarks have been criticized by leaders of the Islamic faith for their lack of condemnation of Hamas' actions. Imam Mohamad Tawhidi, president of the Islamic Association of South Australia, called Rep. Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.,
"absolute frauds and Islamists who promote hatred against the Jewish people. Ilhan does not believe that the Jewish people or the Jewish nation has a right to exist."
Mohammad bin Abdul Karim Al-Issa, secretary general of the Muslim World League, will join CEO David Harris of the American Jewish Committee to visit Auschwitz in January for the 75th anniversary of its liberation. On April 31, they signed a memorandum of understanding that "codifies the commitment to further Muslim-Jewish understanding and cooperation against racism and extremism in all its forms." Al-Issa further stated, "I will encourage Muslims and non-Muslims to embrace mutual respect, understanding and diversity."
We need to ensure that anti-Semitism in America does not become normalized. We need to condemn the offensive and vile memes and the stereotypes that prevail across the internet. We need to ensure our children learn to love and accept people of all races, religion and creeds; to teach our children that everyone has a right to have different views. We need to raise children who will grow to build bridges, not walls. It is our duty as parents bringing up the next generation to rise above and defeat hate.
Look into your child's eyes and envision the world you want to remember. Hate has no place in our society.

Texto completo: Mothers' Day can be bittersweet. For those who have lost their mothers, this day can be weighted with emotional memories, both good and bad. Those who still have their moms and who are blessed with being a mom, know there's nothing like a mother's love.
As we celebrate this upcoming Mother's Day, I want to discuss the positive impact a mother's nurturing has on the outcome of a child.
It's a given, mothers want what's best for their children; though occasionally, what is perceived as "best" in the mother's eyes can also have a reverse impact on the child's emotional and behavioral disposition.
As an example, mothers (and parents in general) focus on the importance of their child's academic performance; though education is important and does set the stage for future opportunities, there are other attributes to consider.
A child who is taught to manage their emotions is two times more likely to become successful in life.
In addition, children with good self-control and reduced compulsivity are less likely to have behavioral problems, drink, take drugs or end up in jail.
Furthermore, a mother's tone while speaking to her child also affects the brain's structural development.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Joan Luby from the Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, compared the interaction and development of two separate groups of 3- and 4-year-old children.
The first group hosted extremely nurturing and interactive mothers, while the second group had mothers with less or non-nurturing attributes.
After four years of research, the children who had considerable amounts of nurturing and guidance developed a 10 percent larger hippocampus on MRI brain scan studies.
The hippocampus, located in the center of the brain, directs bodily functions, controls learning and memory, while also supporting the body's response to emotional stress.
A subsequent study conducted by Dr. Akemi Tomado, a child mental health researcher in Japan, found less developed gray matter in the brains of children who had been verbally abused.
Gray matter, a major component in the brain, controls emotions, attention span and decision-making.
Children whose parents frequently yell and repeatedly state the children were "bad" exhibited lower self-esteem.
Typically, parents who use strong but directly negative language toward children believe they are making their child more responsible and compliant; research shows that parental sarcasm and threats inadvertently make children feel guilty, unloved and inferior.
This poor self-perception can lead to depression and/or anxiety in children.
So, what's the best approach in nurturing your child? Disciplining your child, teaching your child? What's the best way to communicate while trying to teach them right from wrong?
Stay calm, model good behavior. Recognize your emotions. Never try to discipline a child when you are angry.
Seek professional help when needed to better handle parent/child issues.
Don't suppress child's feelings. Allow the child to express his or her emotions such as crying, but teach the child to define behavior with a word.
For example, you state: "You are frustrated your brother took your toy but hitting your brother is never OK."
Feelings are what they are. Children should own their feelings, but outbursts caused by feelings are not good and will get them into trouble.
Have empathy for your child. Let your child know you are listening. As an example, say, "I understand you are angry, you want to yell and scream, please know I'm here if you need me."
You are not agreeing with the behavior but stating you do understand it.
It's important to note, screaming at a yelling child only makes the yelling louder as he or she wants to be heard.
Remember, if you both are yelling, no one is listening.
Problem solve. Once their anger dissipates, children need guidance to help problem solve.
A mother could say, "Next time, when you become angry, how could you behave differently?"
When the child responds with a different solution, answer: "If you do that instead, what do you think would happen next time?"
This will build the child's self-esteem and improve inappropriate responses over time. Always watch for good behavior and praise that behavior.
Listen. Make sure when communicating with children they have your undivided attention. No phones allowed
If you don't give them undivided attention, your child will seek help elsewhere or worse, stop talking to you altogether, while internalizing stress.
Avoid pacifying bad behavior. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents against using technology to pacify an unruly child as this method does not allow the child to learn to regulate his or her emotions.
Seek help from a pediatric healthcare professional when needed.
Some children need an evaluation to rule out autism, developmental delay, anxiety, ADD or ADHD. Sometimes a formal behavior modification program can be instituted to encourage good behavior and build self-esteem.
Our job as mothers is to nurture our children to help them find their unique gifts, as they all possess them.
As New York Times best-selling author, Dr. Wendy Mogel, states, "Try to see your child as a seed that came in a packet without a label. Your job is to provide the right environment and nutrients, while also pulling out the weeds. You can't decide what kind of flower you'll get, or in which season it will bloom."

Global Regulators Race To Curb U.S. Tech Giants

Texto completo: Governments are in a global race to scrutinize Silicon Valley, creating a broad regulatory wave aimed at curbing the power of a small group of American tech companies.
French government officials said Friday they plan to give regulators there sweeping power to audit and fine large social-media companies like Facebook Inc. if they don't adequately remove hateful content. Competition authorities in India, meanwhile, have launched a probe into whether Alphabet Inc.'s Google uses its mobile operating system to block rivals.
The dual efforts are the latest in a series of increasingly aggressive probes and tough new regulations around the world circumscribing tech firms on a number of different fronts. The European Union has enacted broad restrictions on how companies handle data as concerns over privacy grow. Governments are negotiating where tech giants should pay their taxes and investigating whether some companies are abusing their size and market power to thwart competition.
Officials are also sharing information among themselves. An Indian official familiar with the new Google probe said government officials there consulted with European and U.S. officials before launching their investigation into its Android operating system. The EU, which has inspired countries' tech probes in the past, fined Google 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion) alleging it abused the dominant position of Android.
A Google spokesman said it looked forward to working with Indian competition authorities to "demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less."
American officials have shown a new willingness to embrace regulation, too. The Federal Trade Commission is completing a settlement that could include a fine for Facebook of as much as $5 billion, alleging breaches of consumer privacy. The body's commissioners advocated a new data-privacy law Wednesday in front of a House subcommittee.
Some prominent politicians, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat running for president, have called for breaking up some big tech companies. Those calls seemed far-fetched just a few years ago but have started to resonate more broadly amid the regulatory onslaught.
Chris Hughes, who helped Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg create the social-media giant, called this past week for the company to be broken up, writing in a New York Times opinion piece that it had amassed "unprecedented and un-American" power and evoking the forced break ups of Standard Oil and AT&T. Facebook says accountability is best enforced through new rules for the internet, not a breakup.
The French proposal attempts to draw a finer line on one of the thorniest topics raised by the wave of new laws aimed specifically at policing content: how to regulate social media's excesses without trampling free speech.
The French proposals are modeled on how banks are required by regulators in many jurisdictions to take adequate measures to protect their customers against fraud. The legislation would give new authority to an independent regulator in France, with investigative powers to verify that firms are appropriately guarding against the publication of hate speech on their platforms, according to French officials. The measures don't, however, oblige companies to detect every piece of hate speech, the officials said.
Because of free-speech concerns, France's proposals would only require companies to maintain an effective system for removing illegal content but wouldn't make them liable for every single posting, like in some other countries, French officials said. A regulator could issue hefty fines -- to as much as 4% of a company's global revenue -- in the event that companies were found to be lacking in their internal processes, the officials added.
"Even if their system of regulation is effective, it's as if a bank said to regulators, 'When it comes to banking oversight, don't worry about it, I'm on top of it,'" said Cedric O, France's junior minister for digital affairs. "The state should be able to check they are on top of it."
French officials unveiled the proposals Friday ahead of a meeting between President Emmanuel Macron and Facebook's Mr. Zuckerberg, after several months of visits by French officials to Facebook offices.
Following the meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg said he was "encouraged and optimistic about the regulatory framework that will be put in place." He added he hopes the rules "can become a model, not just a national model for France but can be worked into more of a framework across the EU overall."
Facebook executives said the company supports the overall thrust of the regulation, in part because it avoids overly prescriptive rules, but said they would seek limits on the scope of potential audits and level of potential fines.
"It's going to be hard for us. There are going to be things in there that we disagree with. That's natural," Mr. Zuckerberg said.
Big tech companies say they already work hard to remove illicit and harmful content and do so increasingly with the help of automated tools.
Tech lobbyists have opposed efforts to create too many obligations to remove content, in part because they say it would hurt smaller firms without the resources to police every posting. In March, the U.S.-based Information Technology Industry Council said in a policy paper about European tech proposals that requirements to monitor or filter all content could create "unrealistic or undesirable burdens."
Tech executives and free-speech activists warn that requiring the internet be scrubbed of all illicit content could lead to a chilling effect on free expression.
The French move accelerates efforts by governments to make tech companies more responsible for inappropriate content -- whether it be electoral disinformation, terrorist propaganda or a pirated copy of a Hollywood film. Calls for more regulation on social media have intensified after a gunman this year killed 51 at two mosques in New Zealand while broadcasting a live video on Facebook.
On Wednesday, Singapore approved a new law that requires social-media platforms to take down or issue corrections to articles or statements that government ministers deem to be false. Australia's parliament last month passed a bill requiring social-media companies expeditiously remove violent material on their platforms.

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
AMERICAN BALLET THEATER at the Metropolitan Opera (May 13-July 6). The Italian theatrical form commedia dell'arte, popular from the 16th century to the 18th century, introduced the mischievous Harlequin and the object of his affection, Columbine, whose father attempts to thwart their playful relationship. Marius Petipa made a ballet of their antics in 1900, and Alexei Ratmansky reimagined it, based on Petipa's notes, for Ballet Theater, where he is the artist in residence. Ratmansky's cheery "Harlequinade" made its debut last June, and now it kicks off the company's spring season with a week of performances.

DANCE BROOKLYN at City Tech Theater (May 11, 7 p.m.). This annual celebration of Brooklyn-based dance companies is a smorgasbord of global styles. Participants will include Something Positive Inc., which will contribute a dance reflecting an Afro-Caribbean blend of African and French social styles; the Brooklyn Irish Dance Company, which will perform an excerpt from "A Celtic Christmas Story"; and Ninja Ballet, which fuses ballet and martial arts. Other artists will add salsa and belly dancing to the mix. This free event is presented by Purelements, an East Brooklyn arts organization and dance company that will do a work by Hollie Wright.

SIMONE FORTI, STEVE PAXTON AND YVONNE RAINER at Dancespace Project (May 16-17, 8 p.m.). Forti, Paxton and Rainer first met in 1960 while studying under the modern dance pioneers Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. A few years later they forged another path, participating in the founding of Judson Dance Theater, which ushered dance into its postmodern phase. They have remained influential artists ever since, and all have written books. This event reunites them for performative readings of their material, illustrating an important narrative thread in the story of American dance.

LA MAMA MOVES! DANCE FESTIVAL at La Mama's Ellen Stewart Theater (through May 26). This eclectic annual festival features local and global artists hailing from China, South Korea and Norway, among other countries, curated, as from the beginning, by Nicky Paraiso. This week, the choreographer Hari Krishnan, whose work draws on both queer theory and South Indian dance, presents four pieces that each dissect, satirize or subvert cultural stereotypes (Sunday, 7 p.m.; Monday, 3 p.m.). From Wednesday to May 19, Bobbi Jene Smith, a magnetic former member of the Batsheva Dance Company who now makes her own raw, mesmerizing work, offers "Lost Mountain," which she performs in along with 11 other musicians and dancers.
212-475-7710, lamama.org
NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through June 2). For the first time, the work of City Ballet's founding choreographer, George Balanchine, and that of its current resident choreographer, Justin Peck, are on a program together (Friday, Tuesday and Thursday), cementing Peck's status as the heir apparent and the shaper of the company's modern identity. In between, spread over two shows and mixed in with other Balanchine classics, Peck's latest piece and new dances by Pam Tanowitz and Gianna Reisen enjoy a few encores. On Wednesday, Balanchine gets his own program that comprises the large-scale "Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet" and "Tschaikovsky Suite No. 3."

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
JODY OBERFELDER at the Flea Theater (May 15-18, 7 p.m.; through May 19). This week, Oberfelder concludes her trilogy examining the biological wonder and symbolic meanings of our bodies. In 2013, she focused on the heart in "4Chamber" and, in 2017, turned to the head in "The Brain Piece." Her latest, "Madame Ovary," explores gender and the anatomy of sex, using Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" as a point of reference to track how far we have and have not come in conceptualizing gender and its social role. Oberfelder's multimedia approach includes dance, film, spoken word and an original score by Missy Mazzoli.

PARSONS DANCE at the Joyce Theater (May 14-15, 7:30 p.m.; May 16-17, 8 p.m.; through May 26). In a review of Paul Taylor's "Runes," which had its premiere in 1975, the New York Times dance critic Anna Kisselgoff called it "spellbinding." One of its performers, David Parsons, went on to form his own company and create dozens of attractive, athletic dances. For its two-week residency at the Joyce, Parsons Dance will perform "Runes" in tribute to Taylor, who died in August. The program will also include Trey McIntyre's "Eight Women," which honors another recently deceased artist, Aretha Franklin; Parson's own "Nascimento"; and his enduring light trick dance, "Caught."

SUNDAYS ON BROADWAY at Weis Acres (May 12, 6 p.m.). Five years ago, Cathy Weis opened up her downtown loft for this intimate series of one-off performances, readings and discussions by veteran artists and newer voices. This week, she curates the offering with Emily Climer. The participants are Daniel Lepkoff and Sakura Shimada, whose work explores the practice of physical communication; Kota Yamazaki, who performs a solo that references his recently completed "Darkness Odyssey" trilogy; and Doug LeCours, who does a duet with Anna Witenberg in which their bodies become atoms that attract, repel and collide.

VANGELINE THEATER at Theater for a New City (May 16-18, 8 p.m.; through May 19). Tatsumi Hijikata, a pioneer of the haunting postwar Japanese performance art butoh, once said, "Since the body itself perishes, it has a form. Butoh has another dimension." That idea of disappearing and tapping into another realm was a catalyst for "ɪˈreɪʒə (Erasure)" by the New York-based butoh artist Vangeline. In the hourlong solo, she attempts to render herself symbolically invisible so as to allow room for women who have been erased throughout history. The intention, she writes in an artist statement, is that they may then "come back and dance through me."

Texto completo: Righteously correct was Bill de Blasio when he excoriated Councilman Ruben Diaz Sr. Thursday. But the mayor could've used a mirror.
During City Council sensitivity training Wednesday, members were asked what they'd do if they overheard a staffer making sexually inappropriate comments to a visibly upset female subordinate; Diaz, ever the idiot, yelled, "I'm not gonna rat my people out! This place is full of rats!"
Aiming at Diaz on Twitter, the mayor called those comments "disgraceful and dangerous," adding that reporting harassment is "the obligation of all 400,000 public servants in this government. That includes YOU."
Indeed it does. Council members hire, fire, promote and demote people, and as such set the tone for what is tolerated in the workplace. Diaz failed the test, miserably.
But, well, so has de Blasio. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that the mayor's acting chief of staff, Kevin O'Brien, was quietly allowed to resign from City Hall in early 2017 after two women complained he had harassed them; the bad behavior stayed secret, and O'Brien found a soft landing at a political consulting firm with tight ties to the mayor.
Nor has de Blasio ever adequately explained what he meant when he tried to blame a "hyper complaint dynamic" at the Department of Education for the fact that, despite hundreds of sexual harassment complaints in the school system annually, a tiny fraction are substantiated.
Reporting sexual harassment is the obligation of all 400,000 public servants in this government, Mayor de Blasio. That includes you.

Texto completo: Uber Technologies' journey as a public company got off to a slow start.
The ride-hailing giant on Thursday priced its highly anticipated initial public offeringat $45 a share, near the bottom of its target range of $44 to $50 apiece.
The conservative price may have been needed to attract investors following a 23 percent decline in the shares of rival Lyft since it went public six weeks ago. Uber and its bankers may also want to ensure the stock has a nice “pop" when it begins trading Friday.
After a decade of Uber being one of the hottest privately financed companies in the world, raising nearly $20 billion at ever-escalating values, the IPO price is something of a comedown. But Uber is going public at a difficult time for the stock market, which has been roiled by a flareup in US-China trade tensions.
Uber will hit the market with a value of $82 billion, down from earlier estimates of $90 billion to $100 billion but still delivering billions of dollars in paper profits for its founders and early investors, even as the company remains awash in red ink. Uber raised $8.1 billion, the largest US tech IPO since the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba brought in $22 billion in 2014. Facebook raised $16 billion in 2012.
While San Francisco-based Uber is much larger and more diversified than crosstown rival Lyft, both face the same existential question: Is it possible to make a profit matching independent drivers with cellphone-wielding consumers looking for a ride?
“This is an unattractive and unprofitable industry," said Peter Cohan, who teaches entrepreneurship and strategy at Babson College, citing abundant competition and intense pressure on pricing. “Is there a strategy to make it profitable? No."
Earlier this week, Lyft reported an operating loss of $211.5 million in the first quarter, compared with $228.4 million a year earlier, as revenue climbed 95 percent to $776 million.
Brian Roberts, Lyft's chief financial officer, said 2019 would be “our peak loss year, and then we will move steadily toward profitability."
In a regulatory filing, Uber put its first-quarter adjusted loss at $1 billion to $1.11 billion, compared with a loss of about $890 million in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $3.04 billion to $3.1 billion was about 5 percent higher, representing a worrying slowdown from much headier rates of growth last year.
Uber is pitching itself as far more than a taxi-killer. Its Uber Eats food-delivery service is growing quickly, and the company has gotten into bikes, scooters, freight trucking, and autonomous vehicles.
Some investors who are bullish on Uber's future have drawn an analogy to Amazon, which lost money early on as a bookseller but came to dominate Internet retailing. Amazon, however, was solidly in the black by its 10th year, and its biggest profit generator now is its cloud computing business.
How Uber performs once it starts trading could set the tenor for other tech IPOs in the pipeline. They include offerings by Slack, a so-called direct listing that could value the messaging software company at more than $15 billion, and WeWork, the co-working real estate landlord, which has a private valuation of $45 billion, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. Airbnb, the short-term residential rental company, valued at about $35 billion, may file to go public later this year.
Some of Uber's biggest investors are selling small fractions of their stakes in the IPO. They include cofounders Travis Kalanick, who holds 8.6 percent of the company on a pre-IPO basis, and Garrett Camp, with 6 percent. SoftBank's Vision Fund, Uber's biggest investor, with a 16.3 percent stake, is also selling some shares.
The second-largest investor in the company, Benchmark Capital, sold shares previously and holds an 11 percent interest. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Google parent Alphabet each own just over 5 percent.
In conjunction with the IPO, qualified Uber drivers will get cash bonuses of $2,500 to $10,000, based primarily on the number of trips driven. They will also will have the option to buy a limited number of shares in the IPO.
So what happens next? Uber's shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UBER. Regular NYSE trading starts at 9:30 a.m. It will probably take a couple of hours for buyers and sellers to agree on a price so Uber shares can begin changing hands.

Donald Trump's Tom Petty Moment; The President says he won't blink with China, but is he ready for the market consequences?

Texto completo: Speaking at a political rally in Florida last night, President Donald Trump echoed the late great native Floridian Tom Petty. Specifically, Mr. Trump was describing the U.S. negotiating posture in a critical trade negotiation:
We won't back down until China stops cheating our workers and stealing our jobs.
If he's referring to the theft of U.S. intellectual property, the President has a legitimate case but that doesn't mean Chinese dictator Xi Jinping is willing to change his business model. Also, since President Trump inaccurately referred to Mr. Xi as a "great guy," the communist thug may wonder how much he really needs to reform.
At least Mr. Trump seems to have some room to negotiate. Constituents of Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) include soybean farmers who have been directly targeted by Beijing in retaliation for Trump tariffs on Chinese goods. Sen. Rounds said on Fox Business this morning that while producers in his state would love to see a deal and are feeling the impact of the current dispute, they understand the President intends to drive a hard bargain and are generally willing to give him time. Mr. Rounds then emphasized that China must start honoring U.S. patents and copyrights.
Beyond farmers, there's of course a much broader constituency of U.S. consumers and investors that Mr. Trump also needs to persuade to accept some pain for long-term economic gain. A friendly neighborhood trader of equity derivatives warns that many institutional clients are not positioned for a trade war. The President who loves to cite the stock market as a barometer of his economic policy should understand that equity prices could move sharply lower if his China negotiations yield no agreement but only much higher tariffs on both sides.
Among the potential obstacles to a deal: White House officials believe that Chinese negotiator Liu He genuinely seeks reform, but does anyone believe that about his boss Xi Jinping? The possible philosophical gulf between China's dictator and his representative means that concrete progress in negotiations may actually be the cause of a recent impasse. Jim Lucier of Capital Alpha Research believes that "the existence of a written draft itself was part of the slowdown. When Liu was talking about an agreement... he had more freedom, and Chinese leaders who saw opening up China's economy as being in the Chinese interest had more leverage. With a written text to circulate among elite officials, critics of the deal had concrete points they could object to."
All this column can say for sure is that if the Chinese government refuses to agree to respect property rights, it will probably need to come up with a better excuse than the one it has been offering lately.
Lingling Wei and Bob Davis report in the Journal:
As talks resume Thursday, one big question mark is whether China will agree to U.S. demands for changes in Chinese law to implement the trade deal. Beijing maintains this would impinge on Chinese sovereignty and take too long to implement...
Dictatorships can change the law with a phone call. We're all for dignified diplomacy, but are U.S. negotiators supposed to pretend that China's National People's Congress is composed of real legislators who will now embark on independent and careful deliberations? All agreements to expand trade involve governments relinquishing some measure of control over commerce. Whether a deal is codified in Chinese law or not, the real question is whether the Beijing regime intends to follow it.

"Earnings Recession Averted"
Recently this column noted that despite warnings from left-leaning economists, the U.S. continues not only to avoid a recession but to enjoy rising prosperity. Today Lindsey Bell at CFRA Research writes in a note to clients that large U.S. public companies have also lately managed to avoid a profit recession:
At 1.8%, first-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 index is much better than the -3.0% expected going into the reporting period. Almost every sector reported growth that was higher than projected, with only energy and utilities falling short of the consensus. Sales growth was also solid at 5.1%. Looking forward to 2019, growth is pegged at 2.6%, ahead of the 1.9% expected before Q1 results were released.

At Last, a Moderate Democrat for President? "Delaney slams 'half-baked socialist policies' from 2020 field's left flank," Politico, May 7
Legal Trial Unlikely to Match the Show Trial "House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) laid out the case for contempt. He raised three often repeated complaints against [U.S. Attorney General William Barr] in that he failed to release an unredacted report by special counsel Robert Mueller, allegedly lied twice to Congress, and refused to appear before the committee. Yet, notably, the only claim the committee seeks to put before a federal court is the redaction of the report. That seems rather curious since, if Barr lied or refused a subpoena as House leaders claim, it normally would be an easy case of contempt. The reason for this move is that House Democrats know both claims would not withstand even a cursory judicial review," Jonathan Turley in The Hill, May 8

Facebook Co-Founder Chris Hughes Says Company Should Be Broken Up; One of the social-media giant's originators calls its power 'unprecedented and un-American'

Texto completo: Chris Hughes, who helped Mark Zuckerberg create the company that eventually became Facebook Inc., is calling for the social-media giant to be broken up.
In a nearly 6,000 word opinion essay published online Thursday in the New York Times, Mr. Hughes said the Facebook chief executive has gained power that is both "unprecedented and un-American."
Mr. Hughes said Mr. Zuckerberg's focus on growth led him "to sacrifice security and civility for clicks," and that if Facebook remains intact, its monopoly over online social interaction "will become even more entrenched."
Facebook said accountability comes with success but that the right way to enforce it isn't through a corporate breakup but by crafting new rules for the internet. "That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for," Nick Clegg, Facebook's top policy adviser, said in a statement. The CEO is meeting with government leaders this week to further that work, he added.
Mr. Hughes's critique follows growing calls by U.S. and European lawmakers for tougher regulation of internet giants in the wake of data and privacy scandals, and as Facebook faces a possible U.S. Federal Trade Commission fine of up to $5 billion over its consumer-privacy violations.
At a hearing in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, all five members of the FTC said Congress should pass a law addressing data privacy. Lawmakers from both parties agreed but appeared divided over how any such legislation would take shape.
Some lawmakers have urged more drastic action. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, has called for the breakup of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.
Members of Silicon Valley's elite , including senior executives from Apple Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp., have called for some form of greater oversight of the tech industry. So has Mr. Zuckerberg, writing in a March op-ed published by the Washington Post and Ireland's Independent that global regulators should take a "more active role" in governing the internet.
Facebook has taken steps recently to address concerns about online discourse, including by redesigning its website and mobile app . The changes place more emphasis on private groups and visual stories, and less on the platform's News Feed.
In recent years, other former Facebook employees and executives have taken aim at the social network, particularly its addictive nature. In 2017, Sean Parker, Facebook's founding president, told Axios that the platform was designed around social validation.
Chamath Palihapitiya, the company's former vice president of growth, took a harsher tone in a talk at Stanford University, saying "short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works." He later softened his comments after being rebuked by Facebook.
Mr. Hughes has maintained an active presence in politics since exiting Facebook in 2007 to join former President Obama's first election campaign. He is a co-chairman of the Economic Security Project, which supports the idea of universal basic income, and is a senior adviser at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning public-policy think tank.
In 2012, he purchased a majority stake in the New Republic and spent years trying to turn the magazine into a more digitally driven media company. He ended up selling the property in 2016.
In his essay, Mr. Hughes said he hasn't seen Mr. Zuckerberg in person in nearly two years. He said his former Harvard classmate is a "good, kind person" whom the U.S. government needs to hold more accountable for the immense power Facebook wields.
"For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive," Mr. Hughes wrote.

Texto completo: A former U.S. intelligence analyst was arrested and charged with providing classified information to a reporter at the Intercept in 2014 about U.S. counterterrorism operations including against al Qaeda, amid a widening U.S. crackdown on media leaks.
Daniel Hale, who is 31 years old, provided the reporter with 17 documents he obtained while working for Leidos, a defense contractor, prosecutors alleged in an indictment obtained in March and unsealed Thursday. The information Mr. Hale shared included documents about terrorism suspects, a presentation outlining U.S. military technical capabilities, and the effects of a U.S. military campaign targeting al Qaeda, the indictment alleged.
An attorney for Mr. Hale couldn't be reached for comment. A representative for Leidos said the company "is deeply committed to protecting customer information" and that it will continue to fully support the investigation.
The documents and other details in the indictment match the description of a book, documentary, and series of articles about drone warfare written by Jeremy Scahill, one of the founding editors of the Intercept, an online news organization that has written critically of the U.S. intelligence community.
The Intercept said it doesn't comment on the identity of anonymous sources.
Mr. Hale, who was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force between 2009 and 2013 and assigned to work with the National Security Agency, was charged with five counts, including violations of the Espionage Act and stealing government property. He is scheduled to make his first court appearance later Thursday.
The case comes less than a year after another former U.S. intelligence community contractor, Reality Winner, was sentenced to more than five years in prison for sending classified information to the Intercept. In Ms. Winner's case, she pleaded guilty to providing the news outlet a document detailing a suspected Russian hack of a Florida election vendor during the 2016 presidential campaign. A third source of classified information to the Intercept, former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Terry Albury, was sentenced in October to four years after pleading guilty to leaking information about the FBI's informant-recruitment tactics and efforts to identify political extremists.
While Mr. Hale is accused of leaking information about operations under President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has publicly described a stepped-up effort to prosecute leaks of classified information to reporters. Such efforts grew under the Obama administration but the number of cases have accelerated in recent years.
A former Senate staffer was sentenced to two months in jail in December, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with journalists including a New York Times reporter. A Treasury Department official was arrested in October for disclosing a trove of information about sensitive financial transactions to a reporter at BuzzFeed News. She has pleaded not guilty and is set to face trial next year.
"Following in the dangerous path of the Obama administration, the Trump administration is continuing to use the Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowers who enable journalists to uncover disgraceful, immoral, and unconstitutional acts committed in secret by the U.S. government," wrote the Intercept's editor in a statement Thursday.
According to the new indictment, Mr. Hale allegedly met the reporter, identifiable as Mr. Scahill, in April 2013 as he was promoting his documentary and book, identifiable as "Dirty Wars," which was nominated for an Academy Award. Mr. Hale texted his friend soon after meeting Mr. Scahill, according to the indictment, saying the reporter wanted him to "tell my story about working with drones" at the opening of his film.
In February 2014, Mr. Hale asked the reporter: "Are you able to chat?" according to the indictment. The next day, Mr. Hale used his classified work computer to print several documents marked SECRET and TOP SECRET, prosecutors said. Later that day, Mr. Hale asked Mr. Scahill if he could travel to meet him. Mr. Scahill told him he was in Los Angeles for the Oscars, the indictment said. Those documents were later published by the online news outlet, the document said.
Mr. Scahill instructed Mr. Hale to download the encrypted communications tool Jabber to have more secure conversations, according to the indictment.
The charges against Mr. Hale are the latest in a raft of cases to emerge publicly in recent years detailing how U.S. intelligence agencies have struggled to prevent the theft of sensitive government secrets by employees and contractors, an issue that attracted intense scrutiny following Edward Snowden's leak of classified files to journalists in 2013 about the NSA's domestic and international surveillance operations.
Mr. Hale began speaking to Mr. Scahill months before Mr. Snowden's disclosures, but appeared to be inspired by the stories that emerged as a result of his leaks, according to the indictment. Mr. Scahill sent Mr. Hale an email with a link to an article about Mr. Snowden on June 9, 2013, and Mr. Hale texted a friend his encounter with Mr. Scahill might provide him with "life long connections with people who publish work like this."
Mr. Scahill is a co-founding editor of the Intercept, an online news organization established in 2014 with the backing of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. It began primarily as a vehicle to publish classified documents provided to journalists by Mr. Snowden, and has continued to report on secret information about U.S. national security matters.

Texto completo: Stephen Moore writes: "The low point of the sleaze campaign was when the media successfully persuaded the Fairfax County, Va., courts to unseal my divorce records from nine years ago—over not only my objections but my ex-wife's. The Post, New York Times and others unfolded our dirty laundry on their pages" (" My Brush With Personal Destruction ," op-ed, May 3).
As a non-attorney, I see only one excuse for such dumpster diving, namely, that the position occupied or potentially occupied by the object of inquiry is so important that no previously established legal contracts need be observed. So why not call this new standard the "Moore Protocol" and apply it immediately to all sitting members of Congress? Reveal any and all of their previously sealed records, contracts and agreements to determine whether these powerful men and women—after all, they hold the right to impeach, try and perhaps remove the most powerful person in world from office—deserve to remain in their posts. As a gesture of charity perhaps not offered Mr. Moore, let's give the option of retaining their previously established privacy to any who resign their congressional posts immediately, say, by sundown.

Texto completo: Duncan Peder McKenzie Jr. was accused of murdering Lana Harding in a horrific crime that rocked the northcentral Montana community of Conrad and the state on Jan. 21, 1974.
Charles Leonard Jacobson was one of two attorneys appointed to defend him.
For some in Conrad, where Jacobson was raising five children, had a law practice, was active in the Masons and taught Sunday school, his decision to accept the appointment and defend McKenzie was unpopular.
Harding was a 23-year old schoolteacher at the Pioneer School 13 miles from Conrad. She was found in a field, beaten, choked and raped.
Business soon dropped off at Jacobson's law practice, and his family received death threats.
"It's like voting," said Dan Jacobson, 63, Great Falls, Jacobson's son. "People vote with their feet."
Charles Jacobson died April 22 of Alzheimer's disease in Great Falls. He was 95.
His death came 24 years after McKenzie, the villain he agreed to defend, became the first person executed in Montana in 52 years after eight stays of execution.
While some in the community saw Jacobson as a villain for agreeing to defend McKenzie, to Dan Jacobson, his father was a humble man who applied the values he learned as a farm kid to the case, including hard work and standing up for what he believed in.
"I loved him dearly," said Dan Jacobson, calling Charles Jacobson a great father, friend and adviser.
A quiet man of faith who strongly believed in due process of the law, Jacobson never regretted his decision to represent McKenzie, despite the professional and personal consequences for him and his family, Dan Jacobson said.
"He did it because of his commitment to the law and what he thought was right," Dan Jacobson said. "It did shape a part of his life, and how he responded to it shaped our lives a little bit too, not in a negative way. It just underlined the commitment he had to doing the right thing whether it was comfortable or not."
Charles Jacobson didn't seek out attention, Dan Jacobson said.
But his father and Barney Reagan, who was the lead in the case, became notable figures after they became the court-appointed defense attorneys for McKenzie in a case that was splashed across newspapers not only in Montana but across the country, with the story receiving coast-to-coast coverage in newspapers such as the New York Times and Los Angeles Times.
The trial was moved from Pondera County to Great Falls.
McKenzie was executed by lethal injection on May 11, 1995.
"That was just a small part of who he really was, but he was very committed to keeping the law and doing his duty," Dan Jacobson said of the significance of the McKenzie case on his father's life and career.
A veteran of World War II, Jacobson was born in 1923 in Butte, but was raised on a 900-acre farm and ranch along the Missouri River between Craig and Wolf Creek with 15 or 20 cows.
The family made milk, butter and cream that was delivered by train to Great Falls.
He went on to be valedictorian of his class in Cascade in 1942.
Jacobson's father told him he could keep the profits from farming the land for college, and that's what he did. He used a team of horses. With the money, he attended school in Missoula for two semesters.
He then enlisted in the U.S. Army where, during World War II, he was put in charge of POWs in a camp outside of Paris and also delivered mail to GIs.
Growing up, Jacobson assisted his mother, Minnie, postmistress at the Wolf Creek post office. Dan Jacobson recalled that Minnie was a Republican but became a Democrat after President Truman signed her postmistress certificate.
After his return from the war, Jacobson pursued a law degree and graduated from Missoula in 1950 and then worked at the Legislature writing and re-writing bills. He and Joy, his wife, a schoolteacher from Belt, moved to Conrad to start and raise a family of two sons and three daughters.
"They decided Conrad was a little more advanced because it had sidewalks," Dan Jacobson said.
When he opened the law practice, he didn't have enough money to hire a secretary, so he hooked a tape recorder up to the phone that took messages when he was out. "People hated it," Dan Jacobson said.
He got rid of the tape recorder.
Jacobson was a general practice attorney when the McKenzie case landed in his lap. At the time, he was 50 years old.
After the McKenzie case, only court-appointed cases came his way because some residents quit coming to him for usual cases such as drawing up contracts, Dan Jacobson said. A judge knew his practice had suffered and gave him more appointed work. But the judge would not approve pay for the additional hours Jacobson was working as a result of his defense of McKenzie, and those hours were considerable, Dan Jacobson said.
"So, there were financial pressures, too," said Dan Jacobson, the oldest child, who was attending Montana State University in Bozeman at the time the case started. "It was not a windfall case. It was not like he won the lottery. Not at all. Lots of hard work."
Jacobson was not bitter about the criticism he received over the case.
"I think he felt everyone was entitled to their own opinion," Dan Jacobson said.
Jacobson ran for district judge twice and county attorney once losing each time.
When he was 65, Jacobson needed something else besides the law he loved to occupy his time and began building a log cabin from scratch at a ranch near Monarch that his wife had inherited.
"I would say that added years to all of our lives," Dan Jacobson said of the good fun and camaraderie the family had on weekends peeling logs and building the cabin where they played countless games of cribbage.
When the kids were growing up in Conrad, there was always a Life Magazine or U.S. News and World Report around, and the family listened to Walter Cronkite deliver the evening news.
Around the dinner table, they routinely discussed issues and news with their parents, and were often pressed to think critically about their positions.
"No matter what we felt, he would take the opposite tack," Dan Jacobson said of his father.
Dan Jacobson asked his father once if he would defend McKenzie again. He replied yes.
Charles Jacobson never asked McKenzie whether he committed the crime.
In 2000, Charles and Joy moved to Great Falls. That same year, the Montana Bar Sate Bar Association awarded him his 50-year pin.
Previously, the Cascade County Bar Association recognized him for the high standards he exhibited during the McKenzie trial.
"He was a bigger man than how people defined him," Dan Jacobson said. "He defined himself."

Texto completo: New York Times Co. added 223,000 digital subscribers in the first quarter as the publisher continued to spend aggressively in pursuit of its goal of reaching 10 million total subscriptions by 2025.
The Times reported a net income of $30.2 million, or 18 cents a share, for the quarter, up 38% from $21.9 million, or 13 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue grew 6.1% to $439.1 million, driven by higher subscription revenue as well as growth in its commercial-printing business and rental revenue from its New York headquarters building.
"Subscription revenues made up two-thirds of the company's revenues and for the first time, digital-only subscription revenue was more than a quarter of total company revenue," Chief Executive Mark Thompson said.
Digital-subscription growth slowed in the first quarter. The 223,000 additions -- 79,000 of which were for the lower-cost cooking and crossword apps -- marked a 16% decline from the 265,000 digital subscribers the company added in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
PARIS -- The first person I approached had his hand to his mouth. It was Monday night, nearly three weeks ago, on the plaza of City Hall. He was staring, wide-eyed, at the awful spectacle in front of us: Notre-Dame terribly illuminated from the interior by leaping flames.
Then I noticed that he was weeping. I asked him his name. Mohamed. "Horrible," he said, and he didn't need to say more. The presence of Mohamed, a 33-year-old film producer, in the crowd of mourners that night was a quick representation that Parisian grief was universal and ecumenical. Reluctantly, I left the silent crowd that night to return to The Times's office on the Champs-Élysées so that I could write the story.
In the days since, I have avoided going back to Notre-Dame, or even looking at it too closely during my runs along the river. It is enough to see the great darkened hulk of the cathedral from a distance. There is blackness in the interior, staring out from the openings. The memory of the flames haunts me like a bad dream.
I first moved to Paris when I was 3. Notre-Dame has been a fixed part of my mental landscape all of my life. Its burning was the negation of the miraculous survival of the city through the centuries, exactly what was not supposed to happen. The cathedral's protected status seemed guaranteed by its situation on an island in the middle of the river. It was as though Gen. Dietrich von Choltitz, said to have disobeyed Hitler's order to destroy Paris in August 1944, had changed his mind.
Paris was born on this island, and so, in a sense, was French civilization. Some form of a church has been here since the earliest days. The jarring symbolism of the mother burning -- Our Lady -- has been much on Parisian minds.
Notre-Dame was one monument I didn't pay much attention to because I felt I didn't need to. I could always be certain of its presence. Then, the bare interior, hollowed out by centuries of restorers and revolutionaries, didn't interest me. The permanent flood of tourists was a further inducement to contemplate Notre-Dame from a distance. The great flying buttresses seeming to arc improbably out of the river were -- and fortunately still are -- an astonishment and a satisfactory substitute for closer contemplation.
One afternoon several years ago, I rode my bike through the crowds to look at the Gothic sculptures on the north facade, untouched by the 19th-century restorers. They are dominated by the moving 13th-century Virgin, a rare survivor from the Cathedral's origins. The statue's incompleteness -- she had lost her infant Jesus over the centuries -- symbolized the cathedral's altered state.
On this side, the surrounding narrow streets, which outlived Georges-Eugène Haussmann's 19th-century "rationalization" of the medieval Ile de la Cité, press up hard against the cathedral. They are a stimulating reminder that in the Middle Ages, intensive life took place right up to the great church's doorstep. The modest scale of the buildings evokes the pre-Haussman island, a disreputable neighborhood of grog shops and loose morals where the bourgeois didn't venture.
It will be some time before this sort of Saturday excursion is possible again, physically and mentally. The feeling of invulnerability that is one of the beguiling mysteries of the city has been broken. That feeling survived the destructions of the Revolution and the Commune, bombardments during World War I, the German Occupation and the terrorist attacks of 2015.
The partial ruin of Notre-Dame is of a different order. That is why it continues to haunt Paris nearly three weeks later. And that is why, over and over again, the people on the plaza that night, looking on helpless at the great ballooning clouds of yellow smoke pouring from the roof, spoke to me of a chain that had been broken, a continuity fatally disrupted.
"It's a thousand years of memory that's going," said Marlene Ruat, a 34-year-old hospital worker. "Part of our history that is just disappearing."
Ms. Ruat was standing with her hospital colleague Marc Bertrand, also 34, at the edge of the Seine. "It is at the origin of lots of things," she said. "You can see, the crowd is silent," Ms. Ruat said, looking around. "A lot of people are crying."
Mr. Bertrand said: "Our heritage" -- he used the French word patrimoine, encompassing the whole monumental-cultural-architectural legacy so precious to his country -- "is the last thing we have."
Ms. Ruat said: "This is causing a lot of pain."

Texto completo: Some of them barely register any more.
A mass shooting has to be really horrific to penetrate our fatigue, our numbness, our sense of its inevitability.
Deciding whether a particular attack is worthy of our overtaxed attention requires certain calculations: How many were killed? Just one, only four, six, or more? Were they adults or children? Did they look like us or no? Was it close to home, or in some distant place? What religion did the shooter profess to follow? Did they leave a manifesto? Could it have been worse?
So, to Tuesday's attack at a STEM school in Highlands Ranch, near Denver. Is this one sickening enough to be worthy of notice, or remembering?
Two teenagers walked into their own school and shot nine students. One of them, Kendrick Castillo, was killed just three days before graduation, after he charged one of the shooters. The school is not far from Columbine High School, where two seniors murdered 12 students and one teacher almost exactly 20 years ago. The death toll that shocked the nation then has been exceeded many times since, raising our tolerance every time.
Remember Umpqua Community College, in Roseburg, Ore., with nine dead and eight injured in 2015? Or Marshall County High School in Kentucky, where two were killed and 18 wounded last year? How about the Sun Trust Bank in Florida, where five women were murdered in January?
I didn't either, until I looked them up.
It's possible Castillo's heroism at Highlands Ranch breaks through the noise here, or that the school's proximity to Columbine keeps this shooting from blending in with others. Perhaps the fact that a gunman shot six people, killing two, on the last day of classes at UNC at Charlotte exactly a week earlier will make both shootings stick with us. Or maybe we just note the body count, decide we've seen worse, and move on.
They're so common, and we are so lousy at doing anything to stop them, that we've come to view mass shootings almost as natural, like weather events. Schools have adjusted, putting even little children through active shooter drills, in case luck deserts them.
“I heard a gunshot," Makai Dixon, 8, told The New York Times on Tuesday. “I'd never heard it before." The second-grader, the story noted, had been training for Tuesday since he was in kindergarten. Enraging photographs showed baby-faced grade-schoolers walking in line, tiny hands clasped above their heads.
God forbid we should actually do something that might lessen the carnage. Even after 20 first-graders and six teachers were killed in Newtown, Conn., and left us reeling, we did nothing. Legislators voted down pathetically weak gun safety measures, even as grieving Sandy Hook parents looked on.
In the wake of Tuesday's shootings, the Newtown Action Alliance — still fighting, though others have moved on from the horror of that December day six years ago — called for a slew of safety measures, some of which should be no-brainers: raising the minimum age for gun purchases to 21; mandating better storage; requiring security features that would prevent a gun being used by anyone other than the owner; requiring waiting periods for gun purchases; keeping them out of the hands of those deemed a danger to themselves or others.
A majority of Americans believe in some gun safety measures. But they're up against a powerful minority, led by the National Rifle Association, which has grown increasingly radical, casting any gun safety measure as state tyranny.
Its fantasies persist because there's money to be made from them. Recent stories, including an April report in The New Yorker, revealed that NRA officials and their associates have made millions for themselves via “gratuitous payments, sweetheart deals, and opaque financial arrangements," self-dealing that has put the nonprofit's finances in jeopardy. And whatever resources NRA officials can spare go to politicians, who parrot the lobbying group's talking points in return, recasting their heartless gun-rights absolutism as heartfelt patriotism.
Their position is only strengthened by our growing tolerance for mass shootings. The more massacres there are, it seems, the fewer we actually see.
Until we're confronted with one awful enough to shatter even our warped idea of normal.

The Brave Young Men of Highlands Ranch and Charlotte; Remarkable courage stops the carnage.

Texto completo: Amid the heartbreak resulting from recent school shootings comes news of exceptional bravery displayed by students.
USA Today reports :
Kendrick Castillo – only days from graduation – acted fast inside of his British literature class at a suburban Denver school Tuesday afternoon. And he paid with his life.
When a gunman burst through the door at STEM School Highland Ranch, barking at students to stay in place and not move, Castillo, 18, rushed the shooter. It was a quick-thinking move that fellow students said gave them a chance to bolt for safety or take cover under desks.
The newspaper adds:
Rachel Short of Bacara USA, a manufacturing business where Castillo began an internship last year, said he performed so well the company gave him a part-time job. Short said Castillo loved engineering and was eager to help people.
"To find he went down as a hero, I'm not surprised,'' said Short, the company's CEO. "That's exactly who Kendrick was."
The Denver Post reports on the hero and the people he left behind :
The father of the 18-year-old killed at STEM School Highlands Ranch on Tuesday confirmed to The Denver Post that his son, Kendrick Castillo, was the sole fatality in the school shooting that left eight others injured.
"He was the best kid in the world," John Castillo said through tears Wednesday morning...
"I wish he had gone and hid," Castillo continued, "but that's not his character. His character is about protecting people, helping people."
The Post story also reveals an early influence on his character:
...Cece Bedard spent a lot of time with Kendrick throughout their childhood, their fathers dragging them to Knights of Columbus meetings. Kendrick immediately took to the organization's creed of helping others, Bedard said.
"He told me he wanted to be a Knights of Columbus because he wanted to help not only people, but his community," Bedard told The Denver Post in a message. "He was the bravest soul I've ever met and never even cared what others thought because he was too busy finding ways to make you smile."
The New York Times reported this week on another kind soul who confronted a shooter:
WAYNESVILLE, N.C. — He kept charging. A bullet to the torso did not stop Riley Howell. A second bullet to the body did not prevent him from reaching his goal and hurling himself at the gunman who opened fire last week inside a classroom at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The third bullet came as Mr. Howell was inches from the gunman, who fired at point-blank range into his head.
Mr. Howell's parents said their 21-year-old son, who is being heralded for his bravery, was shot at least three times. He tackled the gunman so forcefully that the suspect complained to first responders after his arrest of internal injuries, the parents said the authorities told them.
According to CNN:
Howell grew up taking care of his three younger siblings on his family's farm in Waynesville. He spent time working out with first responders and dreamed of serving in the military or firefighting.
In a statement, Howell's family said he always stood up for what he believed and didn't hesitate to help those in need.
"His faith was strong and he knew what he had to do when people needed him most," the family said in a statement Wednesday. "He was always the guy you could count on and he delivered."
Fox News adds that Howell was honored as a member of the U.S. armed forces that he had long dreamed of joining:
The University of North Carolina at Charlotte student and ROTC cadet -- who died a "hero" during a confrontation with the gunman during last week's shooting at the college -- was laid to rest Sunday with full military honors.
His family's obituary notes:
Riley died the way he lived, putting others first. Our hope is that his example resonates with everyone. We hope others will, if ever the need arises, answer the call to be selfless and do the right thing without hesitation. We hope his example of loving, living large, being kind always and finding laughter in the little things will be remembered as Riley's gift to us all.
The gifts that Riley Howell and Kendrick Castillo gave to the students they saved can hardly be measured. In photographs Howell and Castillo appear to be just kids. They were men of great courage.

Bottom Story of the Day
Bleak Grouse "Newly obtained tax information reveals that from 1985 to 1994, Donald J. Trump's businesses were in far bleaker condition than was previously known," proclaims the New York Times today.
Since it was already known that during that period Mr. Trump's ventures began suffering through a series of bankruptcies, perhaps media folk can now debate the many levels of bleakness.
The Times report arrives right around the 29th anniversary of Mr. Trump threatening to sue the Wall Street Journal for reporting on his cash flow problems.
For readers interested in learning more about that era's Trump troubles in real estate, casino operations, commercial airline service and more, this column humbly suggests Chapter 18 of " Borrowed Time ," co-authored by your correspondent. But this column won't claim that it's news.

Trump Claims Goal Was to Show Deep Losses for Tax Purposes; Comments come after report found Trump paid no income tax in eight of 10 years in the '80s and '90s

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump said Wednesday that the deep losses he reported for tax purposes in the 1980s and 1990s amounted to "sport," citing write-offs and tax shelters allowed at the time to avoid taxes by the federal government.
Mr. Trump's remarks on Twitter early Wednesday morning were made in response to a New York Times report from Tuesday that showed he had claimed loses of $1.17 billion from 1985 to 1994, and paid no income taxes in eight of those 10 years.
"You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes," Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning tweets . "Almost all real estate developers did—and often renegotiate with banks, it was sport."
Mr. Trump claimed more losses than any other individual taxpayer in the U.S. during that time, according to the newspaper.
"Real estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation," Mr. Trump posted on Twitter. "Sometimes considered 'tax shelter,' you would get it by building, or even buying."
Under current law, real-estate developers can generate losses more easily than other taxpayers. They can take deductions for depreciation of their property and can also deduct interest when they borrow, among other steps.
Mr. Trump has bucked decades of tradition set by every sitting president since Richard Nixon by refusing to make public his tax returns. Mr. Trump's predecessors and many of his potential rivals in the 2020 campaign have released tax returns as a show of transparency, allowing voters to see how they made money and where potential conflicts of interest may exist.
Mr. Trump has refused to release his returns, citing a continuing IRS audit. No law prevents him from releasing returns while under audit, as previous presidents have.
Earlier this week , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rejected House Democrats' request for Mr. Trump's tax returns. The move will likely send the dispute into federal court.
States have also taken steps regarding Mr. Trump's returns. The New York state Senate on Wednesday passed two bills aimed at Mr. Trump, including a measure that would let leaders of several congressional committees request his state tax return, but the bills' chances of enactment are unclear. California's state senate passed a bill last week requiring anyone appearing on the state's presidential primary ballot to release five years of tax returns.
The Times report was based on what the newspaper said were printouts from Mr. Trump's IRS transcripts.

Motive Matters in Trump Spygate

Texto completo: For the better part of two years I've been saying, in principle, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not wrong to be concerned about the Russians exploiting peripheral Trump campaign figures as witting or unwitting agents. As long as such spying remained discreet and unknown to the public, it could not have influenced the election. Of courses there's a caveat: if such spying was ordered up on a flimsy premise to legitimize internally a story line about Trump-Russia connections that Obama administration officials would then try to peddle to the public through leaks.
This is what should concern us: that quite apart from illegal leaks, which are themselves a big problem, certain intelligence-agency actions were undertaken deliberately for domestic political purposes. Example: It is absurd at this point to pretend that James Comey's original intervention in the Hillary Clinton email matter, based on intercepted Russian intelligence, was not such an action. It relieved the Obama Justice Department of the delicate problem of having to defend politically a decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton, by pretending that an independent institution (in reality the FBI and its chief worked for Mr. Obama) had made the call.
Mr. Comey would never have waited until three weeks before the Democratic Convention if he were seriously entertaining the possibility that Mrs. Clinton might be charged. The Russian intelligence reportedly consisted of prima facie evidence of Justice Department corruption of the Hillary email case, yet Mr. Comey apparently discounted its import even as he reasoned that this supposedly misleading intelligence somehow required his extraordinary intervention to clear Mrs. Clinton. A subsequent inspector general's report found Mr. Comey's intervention improper, but everything about the secret motive behind it remains hidden in a "classified appendix."
Understand: The alternative was not to charge Mrs. Clinton. It was to let the administration own the decision as it should have.
This is the clearest example of intelligence functions being opportunistically used for domestic political purposes, and to my mind the one from which all else flows. But there are others:
It is distinctly possible (not certain) that the FBI, in its dealings with Christopher Steele, deliberately sought to assist his campaign to get the media to report the unsupported accusations contained in his dossier.
It is distinctly possible (not certain) that a decision by Mr. Comey and his intelligence colleagues to brief President-elect Trump on the existence of the Steele dossier but to withhold certain information (such as that the dossier was a concoction of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party) was meant to create an opportunity for the media to report on the dossier's existence but also to deprive Mr. Trump of the opportunity to defend himself by revealing its origins.
About one matter no uncertainty exists: Obama intelligence chieftains John Brennan and James Clapper, after they left office, went immediately on the airwaves to promote the story that Mr. Trump was a Russian agent.
That these actions took place is not a theory and whether they involved a conspiracy remains to be seen. What you might really be waiting for is certain mainstream news organs to acknowledge that these phenomena are real and that the questions they raise are legitimate. So am I.
More real reporting about the Steele dossier was contained in a single tweet from the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, after its Democratic authorship was revealed, than in the 19 months since. She said: "Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year."
The Washington Post's Bob Woodward caused a stir on Fox News recently when he said the intelligence community's adoption of the Steele dossier was "highly questionable" and "needs to be investigated." That need was evident two years ago.
The near-silence of the media on the secret appendix to the report on Mr. Comey and the Hillary Clinton case, even though it was mentioned 17 times in the public report, is baffling -- unless you assume a reluctance to pursue leads that might tend to discredit the very same sources the press had come to depend on to legitimize the Trump-Russia collusion story.
Two years ago, I wrote: "Democrats wanted an independent counsel investigation of Russia's election meddling. They believed it would lead to evidence of, or at least keep alive the story of, Trump collusion. They may be unpleasantly surprised where it really leads."
The questions about Mr. Trump and his competence, ethics and desire for closer relations with Russia are not more important than getting to the bottom of the intelligence community's role in the 2016 election. Because in their minds celebrity triumphs over all, don't expect TV pundits ever to repent of their collusion hysteria. That catharsis is not coming. Look elsewhere for the truth.

Texto completo: For the better part of two years I've been saying, in principle, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not wrong to be concerned about the Russians exploiting peripheral Trump campaign figures as witting or unwitting agents. As long as such spying remained discreet and unknown to the public, it could not have influenced the election. Of courses there's a caveat: if such spying was ordered up on a flimsy premise to legitimize internally a story line about Trump-Russia connections that Obama administration officials would then try to peddle to the public through leaks.
This is what should concern us: that quite apart from illegal leaks, which are themselves a big problem, certain intelligence-agency actions were undertaken deliberately for domestic political purposes. Example: It is absurd at this point to pretend that James Comey's original intervention in the Hillary Clinton email matter, based on intercepted Russian intelligence, was not such an action. It relieved the Obama Justice Department of the delicate problem of having to defend politically a decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton, by pretending that an independent institution (in reality the FBI and its chief worked for Mr. Obama) had made the call.
Mr. Comey would never have waited until three weeks before the Democratic Convention if he were seriously entertaining the possibility that Mrs. Clinton might be charged. The Russian intelligence reportedly consisted of prima facie evidence of Justice Department corruption of the Hillary email case, yet Mr. Comey apparently discounted its import even as he reasoned that this supposedly misleading intelligence somehow required his extraordinary intervention to clear Mrs. Clinton. A subsequent inspector general's report found Mr. Comey's intervention improper, but everything about the secret motive behind it remains hidden in a "classified appendix."
Understand: The alternative was not to charge Mrs. Clinton. It was to let the administration own the decision as it should have.
This is the clearest example of intelligence functions being opportunistically used for domestic political purposes, and to my mind the one from which all else flows. But there are others:
It is distinctly possible (not certain) that the FBI, in its dealings with Christopher Steele, deliberately sought to assist his campaign to get the media to report the unsupported accusations contained in his dossier.
It is distinctly possible (not certain) that a decision by Mr. Comey and his intelligence colleagues to brief President-elect Trump on the existence of the Steele dossier but to withhold certain information (such as that the dossier was a concoction of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party) was a set-up. It was meant to create an opportunity for the media to report on the dossier's existence but also to deprive Mr. Trump of the opportunity to defend himself by revealing its origins.
About one matter no uncertainty exists: Obama intelligence chieftains John Brennan and James Clapper, after they left office, went immediately on the airwaves to promote the story that Mr. Trump was a Russian agent.
That these actions took place is not a theory and whether they involved a conspiracy remains to be seen. What you might really be waiting for is certain mainstream news organs to acknowledge that these phenomena are real and that the questions they raise are legitimate. So am I.
More real reporting about the Steele dossier was contained in a single tweet from the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, after its Democratic authorship was revealed, than in the 19 months since. She said: "Folks involved in funding this lied about it, and with sanctimony, for a year."
The Washington Post's Bob Woodward caused a stir on Fox News recently when he said the intelligence community's adoption of the Steele dossier was "highly questionable" and "needs to be investigated." That need was evident two years ago.
The near-silence of the media on the secret appendix to the report on Mr. Comey and the Hillary Clinton case, even though it was mentioned 17 times in the public report, is just baffling—unless you assume a reluctance to pursue leads that might tend to discredit the very same sources the press had come to depend on to legitimize the Trump-Russia collusion story.
Two years ago, I wrote : "Democrats wanted an independent counsel investigation of Russia's election meddling. They believed it would lead to evidence of, or at least keep alive the story of, Trump collusion. They may be unpleasantly surprised where it really leads."
The questions about Mr. Trump and his competence, ethics and desire for closer relations with Russia are not more important than getting to the bottom of the intelligence community's role in the 2016 election. Because in their minds celebrity triumphs over all, don't expect TV pundits ever to repent of their collusion hysteria. That catharsis is not coming. Look elsewhere for the truth.

Texto completo: When Google rolled out its ad campaign for the Pixel 2 phone in 2017, the TV commercial followed a familiar formula.
There were dizzying close-up shots of the phone. A funky tune full of big-band jazz horns. And, of course, excerpts from positive reviews, similar to what you'd see on a movie poster or book sleeve.
One name stood out alongside quotes from the New York Times and Wired: Marques Brownlee.
His name may have been unfamiliar to most of the people watching the commercial, but on YouTube, he's the name when it comes to tech reviews.
With more than 8.5 million subscribers and 1.2 billion views, Brownlee has four times as many YouTube subscribers as the Times.
In some ways, Brownlee's trajectory mirrors YouTube's. He started reviewing tech gadgets at 15 when his early videos were lo-fi vlogs of him speaking directly at his laptop camera in his room. Now he has several full-time staffers helping him shoot and edit high-quality video from a dedicated studio. In the past year, he published close to 100 videos, including interviews with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Brownlee occupies an enviable position within YouTube's tech review space: He has the independence and autonomy of an outsider, but with insider access.
By sheer numbers, he's a bigger brand than any mainstream media outlet. But by virtue of having built his platform himself, he fits comfortably within the broader framework of the community. In that sense, he's the embodiment of the average YouTuber's most ambitious daydream.
With this reach also comes significant responsibility and, because Brownlee is in many ways his own boss, he ultimately decides where to draw ethical lines.
In a 2018 interview, Recode's Peter Kafka asked Brownlee if tech companies treat him as press or as an influencer.
"I'd say they treat us as press," Brownlee said. "Might say because of my place where I was one of the first YouTubers to get invited and just kind of looped in along with the rest of press at a lot of these things, I got to observe how they work with press."
Kafka asked if a company has offered to pay him directly, or offered to fly him somewhere. Brownlee said companies will cover his flight and hotel if they need to bring him to a remote place.
When asked if he's OK with that, Brownlee responded, "I'm cool with that, that's great, but if it's some sort of a device review or analysis then that has to stop there."
In April, Brownlee spoke to The Post's Teddy Amenabar about the balancing act of providing critical reviews while working with the companies to test the latest products.
"I'm not changing any of my opinions or what I'm saying about a product in a video based on my relationship with the company," Brownlee said. "When they release a product, my job is to be honest and deliver what people want to see and what people need to hear."
Brownlee doesn't call himself a journalist, but he seems to value a similar kind of editorial independence that maintains the trust of his growing audience.
Still, traditional media organizations tend to have stricter rules against accepting travel or lodging from a company. The Washington Post's policy, for instance, states that employees must pay their own way, and that includes not accepting gifts or free trips.
Brownlee also isn't shy with his enthusiasm for certain companies, such as Tesla. When he interviewed Musk, the tone was more enthusiastic than journalistic, especially compared to what Musk would face with an average journalist or conference panel. That shouldn't come as a shock, considering Brownlee was a finalist in a Tesla contest for fan-made ads in 2017 - something you wouldn't find many journalists entering.
To anyone watching a product review on YouTube, maybe that distinction doesn't matter, but it's worth considering the broader implications of that power dynamic, especially when it involves some of the most powerful companies in the world.
Apple, a notoriously challenging company for journalists to cover, highlighted this dynamic in the way it allowed media access to the iPhone X ahead of its 2017 release.
The company decided to change the way it handles reviews of its products by not standardizing the amount of time tech reviewers could spend with the product, or when the reviews could be published.
Not all media organizations were able to test it, and even for those who did, they were mostly beaten to the punch by several YouTubers (along with Popular Science), who were given earlier access and publish dates.
Brownlee, who was not one of those YouTubers, also noticed similarities across those early YouTube reviews.
"[The videos had] all the same talking points, all the same omissions, so you kind of get the idea that this is a genre video, that Apple is curating in a small scale, and it feels like an experiment because it's so new to them," Brownlee told Kafka.
That gave Apple more control over the first reviews that would be published on YouTube. For a tech company trying to limit the potential for negative reviews, it makes business sense. And in this case, since the other reviews were eventually published, you could argue that the impact to the average consumer was negligible.
But it doesn't take a lot of imagination to project a few years into the future and see a scenario in which the access could be far more limited as tech companies attempt to exert more influence on the review process.
For the most part, Brownlee seems to understand the delicate balance between reviewer and multibillion-dollar tech company when it comes to reviewing products.
As tech YouTube continues to grow, and the traditional media shrinks in relative size and influence, it will be up to the next generation of YouTube reviewers to determine the value of editorial independence.
And if the power continues to shift toward the tech giants, consumers will ultimately pay the price.

Share the Wealth; A new program encourages regional museums to get their art out of storage and lend works to smaller institutions.

Texto completo: The Metropolitan Museum of Art owns roughly 1,500,000 paintings, sculptures and other works of art. No more than 5% of them, however, can be viewed at any given time. The rest—including thousands of world-class pieces, enough to stock a satellite museum of similar quality—are locked up in storage. Much the same thing is true of every other major art museum in the world. Even the most popular artists very often end up gathering dust in the basement.
Is there a better way to handle outsize art collections? It's hard for museums to sell off pieces from their permanent collections—and it should be. Museums hold works of art in trust for the public, not as negotiable assets that can be bought and sold at will. But as the New York Times pointed out in a recent story, their collections have grown so large in recent years that the cost and logistics of storage are fast becoming unmanageable.
Enter the Terra Foundation for American Art and Art Bridges, an organization founded by Alice Walton, the driving force behind Arkansas' Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. These two groups have teamed up on a new initiative intended to encourage regional art museums to share their collections—one that in time might also prove to have have the additionally desirable effect of helping to get masterpieces out of storage and put them to better use.
In April, Terra and Art Bridges gave $700,000 to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to support a program that will make it possible for the PMA to loan 16 works of art to eight smaller Pennsylvania museums, where they will be shown as part of exhibitions mostly drawn from the permanent collections of those museums. It's the latest step in a long-term plan to underwrite large-scale exhibitions in Pennsylvania organized along similar lines: Terra and Art Bridges have already made similar grants to the Detroit Institute of Arts and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. All are part of a six-year program aimed at creating an "art-sharing network" of 80 museums.
Some of the exhibitions will have a local focus. Starting on Sept. 15, the Reading Public Museum will mount a show called "Picturing Pennsylvania Barns" in which its "Hill Road," a 1920 PMA-owned painting of a country barn by George Sotter, is hung alongside two important works by Charles Sheeler, one of which, "Bucks County Barn," is a 1918 photograph of the same barn. Similarly, Lancaster's Demuth Museum, which is devoted to the work of Charles Demuth, a celebrated American watercolorist, is borrowing two of his flower studies from the PMA to show as part of "Focus on Flora: Charles Demuth's Florals."
What excites me most about this project is that it is specifically encouraging one of our greatest art museums to lend works to its smaller neighbor institutions. In addition, though, my dream is that it will evolve over time into a much more ambitious collection-sharing program, one that gets larger numbers of important paintings out of storage and in front of the people.
For me, this is personal. I grew up in a small town in southeast Missouri that was a two-hour drive from the nearest art museum. Instead, I was forced to "explore" the visual arts by poring over color plates in my family's World Book Encyclopedia and watching TV programs like "The Louvre," the 1964 NBC documentary in which Charles Boyer took viewers on a tour of France's most celebrated museum. But I didn't see any actual paintings of significance until I took a college trip to New York in 1975, went to the Museum of Modern Art, and was stunned beyond words by my first viewings of Picasso's "Three Musicians" and a Monet water-lily painting. Having finally gotten to see great art in person, I promptly became the passionate museum- and gallery-goer that I am today.
That's why I hope Terra and Art Bridges will keep their eyes on the long-term prize of encouraging more systematic and widespread collection-sharing. Top-tier institutions like the PMA, after all, aren't the only museums that now keep large numbers of significant works of art in storage. Why couldn't such first-class regional museums as (say) the Saint Louis Art Museum and Kansas City's Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art engage in similar partnerships with smaller institutions in their areas?
I think of my own lost opportunity to discover the life-changing power of the visual arts early in life whenever I read about the masterpieces that languish unseen in museum warehouses. For great paintings that no one can see aren't paintings at all: They're nothing more than fast-fading memories. So let's get them out of storage and up on the walls—all over America.

Weeding Out Dubious Marijuana Science

Texto completo: Academics depict the peer-review process as the gold standard for intellectual honesty, ensuring published scholarly work is unbiased and accurate. But ideological conformity makes peer review a far thinner defense than advertised.
In January I published a book about the mental-health and violence risks of cannabis. Several dozen scholars signed a petition expressing in unison their objection to my work. Thus I've recently spent an inordinate amount of time reading papers seeking to prove that marijuana is a cure-all whose deleterious consequences are a figment of our collective imagination. The shoddiness of much of the work has shocked me.
Example: Driving deaths have risen more than 30% in Colorado and Washington, the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use, since dispensaries opened there in 2014. That rise is more than double the national change. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported in October that the number of vehicle accidents overall were up faster in legalized states than the rest of the nation.
Nonetheless, researchers have claimed legalization doesn't increase driving deaths. Last year, Benjamin Hansen of the University of Oregon and two other researchers wrote a paper looking at the rise in vehicular deaths in which drivers had THC in their blood. They found such deaths rose in Colorado and Washington at rates "similar" to those in other states.
In fact, the data showed that legalization explains about half the increase in Colorado and Washington. But because the data were limited, the results had wide confidence intervals, which means it's possible but not probable that the postlegalization gap was the result of chance. A more honest way to report the results would have been to say that the paper had found a worrisome trend in cannabis-linked deaths, which more data might confirm.
Violent crime has also soared in the legalized states since 2013. Yet last month two criminologists claimed in a Seattle Times op-ed that they had found "no increase in violent crime that can be directly attributed to marijuana legalization." That formulation makes the statement a trivial truth. Without examining every murder, no one can say legalization has directly driven the increase.
The authors explain in the op-ed that they based their statement on a paper they co-wrote. They don't name it, but the only published paper listing them as co-authors is a 2018 study called "Marijuana Legalization and Crime Clearance Rates." It didn't even examine whether crime had risen or fallen. It looked only at whether police were likelier to solve, or clear, crimes after legalization. But so what? If murders double from 100 to 200, and the police solve 50 the first year and 110 the second, the clearance rate has risen, but so has the crime rate.
Some of the research is comical. A paper published in March reported that cannabis use seemed to increase "satisfactory orgasms" in women. The paper divided subjects into three categories: nonusers, users who answered yes when asked if they used the drug "before sex," and users who answered no. But it presented results on sexual satisfaction only from the last two categories -- not from women who don't use marijuana at all. The paper provides no data at all comparing users with nonusers.
I could offer a half-dozen other examples of dubious scientific practices -- using nonstandard data sets, relying unnecessarily on "synthesized comparators" that are inherently vulnerable to manipulation, and "p-hacking" by looking at endless secondary outcomes until one pops up that reaches the threshold for statistical significance.
The tricks can be hard to find -- and journalists, who are almost never trained in science or statistical analysis, often parrot the results unskeptically, especially when the findings confirm their own biases toward ideology or sensationalism. When car accidents and violent crime are involved, the results can be deadly.

Texto completo: Author Don Zminda worked for STATS LLC for more than 20 years, so one could say he took an analytical approach to writing "The Legendary Harry Caray: Baseball's Greatest Salesman," using attendance charts, radio ratings trends and other numbers to gauge the late Cubs and White Sox broadcaster's influence.
But Zminda's review of Caray's life and career isn't robotic. He fleshes out the events that helped shape Caray's public image as well as the man behind the mic.
Here are several anecdotes and excerpts from the book that might not be familiar to Caray's fans.
1. When was Caray's birthday?
It's difficult to pinpoint his age with absolute certainty -- he often would change his birthdate depending on the audience.
When Caray died Feb. 18, 1998, the Tribune wrote: "According to 'Who's Who in America,' Caray was born in 1919, making him 78, but the Cubs media guide lists his birth date as 1920. Even with those dates, there was always speculation he was a few years older."
Zminda notes in his book that the New York Times and USA Today pegged Caray's birth year as 1919, while the Chicago Sun-Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Sports Illustrated reported it as 1914.
Zminda writes: "Two decades after Caray's death, it is fairly certain that Caray's birthday was March 1, 1914; that is the date that is listed in St. Louis health records, and that is also the date listed on his Social Security death record (available online at Ancestry.com and other genealogy websites)."
Caray would get others' names, ages and other facts wrong -- or simply took artistic license -- so why not his own?
2. Caray had his duels with Milo Hamilton.
Caray had "Holy Cow!" Off-and-on broadcast partner Hamilton used to say "Holy Toledo!"
The two had what could be called a holy war. Hamilton openly suspected Caray was behind at least one of his firings, if not three. Former Tribune columnist Bob Verdi, the ghostwriter for Caray's autobiography, said Caray flat out refused to put Hamilton in his book.
Two days after Caray's funeral, Hamilton was quoted as saying, "Harry felt that he was bigger than the game" -- prompting Caray's son Skip to call Hamilton "a very sick man." Hamilton, as noted in Zminda's book, tried to approach Skip to explain that the quote was taken from an old article, but Skip waved him away, prompting Hamilton to say Skip treats people like "crap" as his father did.
Zminda illustrates how contentious the relationship was, referencing Hamilton's book, "Making Airwaves: 60 years at Milo's Microphone."
Hamilton, who had leukemia, was hospitalized during the 1982 Cubs season. Zminda notes that "he was watching a Cubs broadcast from his hospital room when he heard Harry say on the air: 'You know, I never missed any games. I don't understand how a guy can take time off during the season.' "
Hamilton died in 2015.
3. "Disco Demolition" and Howard Cosell's deconstruction.
There was plenty of blame to go around for the White Sox's infamous "Disco Demolition" promotion on July 12, 1979, which turned into a riot on the field and ended with the Sox forfeiting the second game of a doubleheader against the Tigers at Comiskey Park.
Cosell, like several of Caray's peers, was not fond of Caray's style and assigned at least some of the blame to Caray, the Sox's TV play-by-play man at the time. As Zminda reminds readers, Cosell said on ABC Radio: "There's just too much of the carnival atmosphere, from the very on-air presentation of the White Sox games to the front office itself."
Caray tried to calm the masses on the field with a rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" -- without success.
"Harry was a pro," Sox owner Bill Veeck later said. "He was the dance band on the Titanic, playing through the disaster."
4. Caray didn't invent "Holy Cow!"
Sure, knowledgeable baseball fans already were aware of this, but it bears further exploration.
Stew Thornley wrote in an article for the Society for American Baseball Research: "Holler 'Holy Cow!' in the eastern United States, and people might think of Phil Rizzuto, the New York Yankees shortstop-turned-broadcaster, while a cry of 'Holy Cow!' in Chicago brings Harry Caray to mind. In the Upper Midwest, though, 'Holy Cow!' remains synonymous with Halsey Hall, who, if not the first to use the expression on a baseball broadcast, was at least using it before Rizzuto or Caray."
Zminda delves deeper into the phrase's origin, crediting USA Today reporter Lisa Winston's research that found "Jack Holiday, who broadcast games for the New Orleans Pelicans of the minor-league Southern Association, also was using 'Holy Cow!' as early as the 1930s."
Zminda adds that Caray "almost certainly was the first to popularize the term for audiences listening to Major League Baseball."
5. Caray had a penchant for embellishment.
What's better than fun at the old ballpark? More fun.
Bob Costas, who was interviewed for the book, told the Tribune last month that when he worked at Caray's former station KMOX-AM in St. Louis in the 1970s, Cardinals fans would regale him with stories of Caray's vivid calls. But for the listener who made his or her first visit to Sportsman's Park "the game disappointed them to some extent because it wasn't as good as listening to Harry on the radio," Costas told the Tribune.
That probably wasn't an accident. Caray came from an era in radio when broadcasters would re-create road games, but some peers and other journalists were uncomfortable with Caray's sometimes loose relationship with the truth when calling games.
Post-Dispatch writer Rick Hummel told Zminda: "When I went to my first game, there weren't as many exciting plays as he suggested on the radio, but he made the game fun."
Former Tribune reporter Ed Sherman summed up in an article published the day after the broadcaster's death: "Caray made baseball's most exciting moments more fun. He made baseball's mundane moments -- and Lord knows there are many -- fun."
6. There were two sides to Caray's fandom.
Ironic for someone who came to be known as a "homer" and once was called former Cubs general manager Dallas Green's "house man," Caray sometimes was feared by players and reviled by managers, team executives and sponsors because of his bluntness.
Hummel told Zminda that former Cardinals third baseman Ken Boyer "paid a heavy price for turning down an interview with Caray one time. Caray did not hesitate to get all over Boyer if he failed in a particular key at-bat."
According to the Tribune's Paul Sullivan in a 2014 article, Sox booth partner Jimmy Piersall said Caray "once told Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf: 'We don't second-guess. We first-guess.' "
7. What is Caray's legacy?
A running theme in Zminda's book props up Caray as the consummate salesman. Critics say he sold himself. Admirers say he sold the game itself -- attendance and ratings rose wherever he chose to roost.
Zminda conducted many interviews for the book, but he sought distinguished former Sun-Times columnist Ron Rapoport's counsel with properly characterizing Caray's imprint. Rapoport says in the book: "Harry's impact on the Cubs franchise was immeasurable. He was the face of the franchise in a way that no player could have been because the players didn't stay that long. But Harry was there forever."

PRODUCING THE PRINTED AJC: Bringing readers a 'Daily Miracle'

Texto completo: It's 8 a.m. on a typical morning. As metro Atlanta slogs its way to work, a group of editors at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is taking part in one of its first news meetings of the day.
With that, the clock begins running.
In just 13½ hours, our printed newspaper goes "to bed." By 9:30 p.m., we'll send our last page to the pressroom so that the latest edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution can continue its journey from our newsroom, through a maze of massive machinery, and into the hands of our newspaper carriers before it reaches its ultimate destination.
All in time for your first cup of coffee.
Since 1990, I've worked in newsrooms around the country -- from Trenton, N.J., to Seattle; from Pittsburgh to Atlanta. Yet, after nearly 30 years, I remain amazed by what is known by journalists around the globe as "The Daily Miracle."
Several weeks ago, I was reminded of that magic -- and the special group of people who make it all come together -- when The New York Times published a photographic essay, aptly titled "The Daily Miracle."
The project showcased the people and the mind-boggling machines that produce the editions of The New York Times distributed around New York City.
The printed newspaper, The Times wrote in its special section, "bows to no product in the modernity and total awesomeness of its production."
That led me to think about our own version of "The Daily Miracle" -- The Atlanta Journal-Constitution -- the same newspaper that has been serving metro Atlanta for 150 years.
Have you ever wondered how the newspaper comes together, day after day after day?
Well, it all begins at that 8 a.m. meeting, where each editor in our newsroom outlines the important stories their teams are pursuing. By the start of that meeting, many of our reporters have already been hard at work, posting stories on AJC.com so that you know whether you'll need an umbrella when you leave the house or just how long it's going to take you to get to the office.
After that meeting, a team of print editors begins making decisions on which stories will appear in your printed newspaper -- and where -- paying careful attention to our reader research.
Based on that research, we know, for instance, that you come to the newspaper for our investigative and enterprise reporting; our intensely local coverage of your community; and the context and understanding only we can provide.
As the morning ends and the afternoon begins, it's time for another meeting.
At our 1:30 p.m. news meeting, many of the editors who took part in the morning huddle reconvene, sharing information on where stories stand and providing updates on any new stories that have "broken" since we last met.
At this meeting, we try to finalize our A1 lineup -- settling on the four or five best stories of the day that will appear on our front page.
Of course, there are often major developments throughout the day and into the night. It's not unusual for us to scrap our plans and start over -- no matter the hour.
With so many decisions to be made, and so many words to be edited, we aren't always as perfect as we would like. We encourage readers to offer their feedback and their suggestions and to engage with our reporters and editors to learn more about our decision-making.
That feedback, after all, only helps us improve.
Throughout the day, our senior editor for visuals works closely with the journalists in her group to ensure that each story is accompanied by the most compelling photographs and video -- both for digital and for print.
Other editors work side by side with their reporters, crafting stories that are fair and balanced; that help you understand the complexities of important issues; that empower you to take action or make informed decisions.
As the afternoon unfolds, our print team closely follows the day's national and international developments.
Of these stories, which of them have the most impact on our readers?
Which rise to the front page or appear on A2 and A3 -- our other home for "Today's Top News"?
Which require local reporting so that we can bring the world home and reflect the Georgia angle?
At this step in the process, it's time for our copy editors and designers to begin their work.
Copy editors edit stories before they are published, searching for spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. They write headlines -- some of the most important words on a page -- and try to ensure stories meet our high standards.
As their name implies, our designers transform blank pages into works of art -- settling on just the right ratio of words to photos.
They, too, remain mindful of bias and balance and make sure each page strikes the appropriate hierarchy -- by that, I mean that the most important stories are displayed in the most prominent positions.
The hours fly by, and it's now 6 p.m.
As most of metro Atlanta heads home from work, our Braves writer has already spent most of the afternoon at the ballpark.
Our County by County pages are nearly completed. So, too, is our daily Living section.
Reporters and editors are wrapping up their stories and pursuing others that have developed.
Over at the A1 desk, a group of editors continues looking at early designs and mock-ups of the front page.
Final deadline is just hours away.
And that's when you begin to see it:
Thousands upon thousands of words have formed paragraphs. Paragraphs have blossomed into stories. Pages of newsprint, once blank, have become permanent pieces of history that will live on forever.
At 9:30 p.m. the final pages are sent to the pressroom, where our four-story-high press begins churning out 800 newspapers per minute.
The next day, the entire process of assembling a newspaper begins again with another 8 a.m. meeting.
After all, there's a new day that must be chronicled and documented. There are blank pages to be filled. New stories and headlines to be written.
The newspaper business is the only one in the world that creates an entirely new product day after day after day.
That's why it's called "The Daily Miracle."
And our newsroom couldn't imagine doing anything more exhilarating -- or more important.
(Box)
The newspaper business is the only one in the world that creates an entirely new product day after day after day. That's why it's called 'The Daily Miracle.'

With anti-Semitism on the rise, Jews must call out hatred on the left and the right

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

REVIEW --- The 'Jeopardy!' Whiz Reads Like A Kid. So Do I.

Texto completo: Everyone's cuckoo for "Jeopardy James" -- that is, James Holzhauer, the 34-year-old professional sports gambler currently dominating the iconic quiz show by winning $902 billion in 11 days, or something like that. Mr. Holzhauer is deploying an aggressive strategy, piling up cash early, but he's also got to have the correct answers to the questions, and I was struck by what he said he uses as a preparation tool:
Children's books.
"I have a strategy of reading children's books to gain knowledge" Mr. Holzhauer told the New York Times. "I've found that in an adult reference book, if it's not a subject I'm interested in, I just can't get into it."
Finally: something I have in common with Jeopardy James! I, too, am a great reader and admirer of children's books, although I'm not reading them in preparation for "Jeopardy!" or anything cool like that. I'm just reading them to my crummy kids, every night, until they stop complaining and fall asleep, and I can finally get some peace, and fall asleep 4 1/2 minutes later.
But Mr. Holzhauer is correct (surprise!). Children's books, especially simple books about single topics like sharks and snakes, have sharpened my intellect in a way that no fancy adult book ever has. Maybe it's the pictures, the large type, the repetition or the clarity of language -- "Sharks don't have bones. Their bodies are supported by cartilage" -- but I recall far more information from a children's book than I ever did from anything I ever read in college.
(I'm just kidding! I didn't read in college.)
The problem is, I don't know where to put all this new information. My son, he can strut into kindergarten and rock his teachers' minds with the knowledge he's learned about king cobras. It's harder for me. The adults I know all want to talk about Mueller, the NBA playoffs or real estate. I know nothing about that boring junk. Ask me about frogs! I know about American bullfrogs, South American Horned Frogs and, of course, poisonous dart frogs, which are barely the size of a gummy bear and will kill you dead.
Nobody cares. I've had to learn the hard way: talk about frogs too much, and adults start looking at you funny. Consider this kind of scene:
DINNER PARTY HOST: We were just talking about books, Jason. What about you? Have you read the new Ian McEwan?
ME: No, I have not read the new Ian McEwan.
HOST: Well, what have you read that you liked?
ME: "Bears."
HOST: Brilliant. What's it about?
ME: Bears.
(That scene is fiction. I don't go to dinner parties. The last time I ate outside of the house was at a rest stop Sbarro's on the New Jersey Turnpike.)
If you're looking to gain an edge on a quiz show, I suggest sticking to children's reference books: classic topics like animals, dinosaurs, planets, construction equipment, fire trucks. Avoid frivolous, anthropomorphic sagas about pig families and dog taxi drivers; that stuff is never going to come up on "Jeopardy!" I didn't know this before my wife and I had children, but about 92% of children's literature is about an animal losing a hat. But it turns out Alex Trebek did once ask a question about Jon Klassen's "I Want My Hat Back," so you never know.
Rod Stewart once sang, "I wish that I knew what I knew now / When I was younger" -- it seems so obvious, but Rod must have been reading about sharks and bears. If you stick with it, you'll see that a good children's book really does widen the mind. I'm not "Jeopardy!" material, but I'm starting to feel like a better adult. Please let me tell you about frogs.

Texto completo: After suffering a historic meltdown a decade ago in the financial crisis, American newspapers began racing to transform into digital businesses, hoping that strategy would save them from the accelerating decline of print.
The results are in: A stark divide has emerged between a handful of national players that have managed to stabilize their businesses and local outlets for which time is running out, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of circulation, advertising, financial and employment data.
Local papers have suffered sharper declines in circulation than national outlets and greater incursions into their online advertising businesses from tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. The data also shows that they are having a much more difficult time converting readers into paying digital customers.
The result has been a parade of newspaper closures and large-scale layoffs. Nearly 1,800 newspapers closed between 2004 and 2018, leaving 200 counties with no newspaper and roughly half the counties in the country with only one, according to a University of North Carolina study.
Meanwhile, about 400 online-only local news sites have sprung up to fill the void, disproportionately clustered in big cities and affluent areas, the UNC study found.
The shrinking of the local news landscape is leaving Americans with less information about what's happening close to them, a fact Facebook recently acknowledged as it struggled to expand its local-news product but couldn't find enough stories. Local TV news is still a major, if declining, source of news for Americans, but local newspapers are vanishing.
"It's hard to see a future where newspapers persist," said Nicco Mele, director of Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who predicts that half of the surviving newspapers will be gone by 2021.
While print circulation is falling throughout the industry, the pace varies, according to a Journal analysis of almost 300 newspapers tracked by the Alliance for Audited Media for which complete data is available.
At three national papers, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post, circulation dropped an average of 29% between 2012 and 2018, the data shows. By comparison, the median drop at major metro papers with circulation of more than 200,000, like the Minneapolis Star Tribune and Tribune Publishing Co.'s Chicago Tribune, was a steeper 41% over that time frame.
The pain was even more pronounced among midsize papers with circulations between 100,000 and 200,000 -- papers like the Hearst-owned Houston Chronicle and A.H. Belo Corp.'s Dallas Morning News -- where circulation fell some 45% between 2012 and 2018. As print ads disappeared, maintaining a bigger circulation became untenable for many papers.
Meanwhile, the Journal, the Times and the Post, while each having their own challenges and being far from out of the woods, all managed to show rising revenue last year with the help of digital subscriptions.
Consolidation in the industry is now being propelled by bargain-hunting financial players who are seeking ever-deeper cost cuts. MNG Enterprises, which is backed by hedge fund Alden Capital and was formerly known as Digital First Media, is pursuing a hostile takeover of Gannett Co., the largest newspaper chain by circulation, pointing to the company's $350 million in digital acquisitions as a strategic disaster.
MNG, which owns the Denver Post and San Jose Mercury News, says "the newspaper business is in secular decline," arguing a better strategy is to focus on profits now.
"What Alden is doing is liquidating," said Dean Singleton, who founded the company that now forms the crux of MNG Enterprises and pioneered several newspaper cost-cutting measures, but who is no longer involved with the management of the company.
MNG says ultimately its aim is to make newspapers sustainable, not close them.
Peter Barbey, publisher of the Reading Eagle, thought he did everything right according to the industry's digital-growth playbook. When the heir to the multibillion-dollar fortune behind brands like The North Face and Timberland took over his family's Pennsylvania newspaper in 2011, he put up an online-subscription "paywall," embraced social media to promote stories and built up a digital ad-sales team -- all now considered vital components of any newspaper's digital turnaround strategy. All the while he built up a high-quality newsroom that won awards.
It wasn't enough. In March, the paper Mr. Barbey's family has owned since 1868 filed for bankruptcy. "It's like we were in a canoe paddling upstream and there was a waterfall behind us," Mr. Barbey said.
Warren Buffett's U-turn on newspapers is an indicator of the industry's predicament. The legendary investor began buying up local papers in 2011, betting they could overcome the horrible economics of the print business by making a transition to the internet.
They didn't. Last year, the "Oracle of Omaha" turned over management of his papers to another company, Lee Enterprises. Newspapers are "toast," he recently told Yahoo Finance, adding that, with the exception of The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post, "they are going to disappear."
With print advertising revenue hammered, online ad sales had seemed like the answer. But not only do online ads fetch a mere fraction of the price of print ads, few people in the industry understood just how potent Google and Facebook would become as competitors for digital-advertising dollars. By 2017, they accounted for 86% of all growth in the industry that year, according to Brian Wieser, a former analyst at Pivotal Research Group.
Local news publishers have been the hardest hit. The tech giants sucked up 77% of the digital advertising revenue in local markets in 2017, compared with 58% on a national level, according to estimates from Borrell Associates and eMarketer.
"When you look at what's evolved, and the amount of revenue that's going to the Googles and Facebooks of the world, we are getting the crumbs off the table," said Alan Fisco, president of the Seattle Times.
Many local newspaper companies tried to team up with the tech companies, creating "local marketing services" units that heavily resell Google and Facebook ads. The profit margins, however, are slim.
Terry Kroeger, former publisher of the Omaha World-Herald and former CEO of its parent company, Berkshire Hathaway's media group, believes one solution is to allow publishers to collectively negotiate with the tech platforms. He backs legislation that would make that possible. A similar bill didn't advance far in the last Congress but Democrats are hopeful that the latest version, which has a Republican co-sponsor, will gain momentum in the Democratic-controlled House.
"You can't help but admire Google's business model," Mr. Kroeger said. "They have close to zero content-creation cost, but are able to turn around and sell the lion's share of the advertising."
Putting up a digital-subscription paywall has so far only worked for a few. For many years, The Wall Street Journal was alone among major newspapers in requiring readers to pay for articles online, a decision it made in 1996. In 2011, New York Times Co. followed suit.
Today, the Times boasts 3.4 million digital subscribers -- 2.7 million of whom are paying for the news product alone, with the rest springing for crossword and cooking extras -- and a newsroom of 1,550 journalists, the largest in its history. The News Corp-owned Journal has 1.7 million digital subscribers and a newsroom of nearly 1,300. The Washington Post, which launched its paywall in 2013, has transformed under owner Jeff Bezos into a national digital enterprise, amassing 1.5 million digital subscribers, according to people familiar with its operations.
The Post charges $10 for a basic monthly subscription, the Times, $15, and the Journal, $39.
Those bigger outlets have been much more efficient at converting online readers into paying digital subscribers than local publishers. The Journal converts 4.5% of its readers and the Times 3.6%, while Gannett, which has a big audience across its local papers, is especially inefficient, converting just 0.4% of its digital audience into paying subscribers, according to the Journal's analysis of digital audience and subscription data. Many paywalled sites let casual users sample some content free.
Gannett says that excluding USA Today, its largest source of web traffic, and other papers that don't have paywalls, its conversion rate would be 1.4%.
The Dallas Morning News in 2011 became the first major regional U.S. outlet to make readers pay for news online. The paper now counts around 30,000 digital subscribers, according to people familiar with the matter, but that contributed to only around 5.6% of its total circulation revenue in 2018. In the last 15 months, the paper has cut more than 170 employees. A major investor is now urging it to consider a sale.
The Minneapolis Star Tribune, owned by billionaire Glen Taylor, has signed up 60,000 digital-only subscribers, and takes in around $200 million in revenue annually, which has allowed it to maintain a newsroom of around 250 for the better part of a decade. "We have stayed profitable, but it gets tighter every year," said Michael Klingensmith, the paper's publisher and chief executive. The Star Tribune will need to surpass 150,000 digital subscribers to be sustainable longer term, he said.
A notable outlier is the Boston Globe, which has amassed 111,000 digital-only subscribers at the robust price of $1 a day, allowing it to support its newsroom of 200 journalists on digital-subscription revenue alone.
Globe President Vinay Mehra says the paper's focus on investigative reporting and sports under Boston Red Sox owner John Henry, who bought the paper in 2013, has propelled its success. Some 35% of those digital subscribers are from beyond New England, a testament to the popularity of the Red Sox and New England Patriots -- a luxury few papers have.
For years, many in the news industry believed that even if newspapers vanished, journalism would flourish in a lower-cost, digitally native form. But those hopes proved misplaced.
Newspaper newsroom jobs declined by 45% from 71,000 to 39,000 employees between 2008 and 2017, according to Pew Research Center. Digitally native newsroom jobs rose from 7,400 to 13,000 in the same period of the Pew study. Those jobs have been highly concentrated in New York and California, according to a Journal analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
That would leave large swaths of America with radically diminished access to local news. A future without newspapers, Mr. Mele of the Shorenstein Center, says, is "actually a crisis for democracy."
Google and Facebook have each announced $300 million commitments to help strengthen journalism, including funds earmarked for local news, and Craigslist founder Craig Newmark has given more than $85 million to journalistic causes.
Between 2010 and 2015, foundations gave $80.1 million in grants to local and state nonprofit news organizations, according to a study by the Shorenstein Center and Northeastern University. That amounts to less than 1% of the $8.3 billion in revenue newspapers lost during that time, according to a study and the Journal analysis of Pew data.

Kootenai GOP backs love, agents of hate

Texto completo: The Kootenai County GOP is just really into free speech, you guys.
Free speech and true love.
That's what led the group to intervene on behalf of Brittany Pettibone, an alt-right online conspiracist now living in Post Falls, and her fiancé, Martin Sellner, whose views apparently influenced the Christchurch mosque shooter.
Pettibone and Sellner are pristine examples of the new wave of racist, conspiratorial alt-right nonsense. The Kootenai County Republicans decided to lie down with them by posting videos decrying a federal decision to revoke travel privileges for Sellner, who is being investigated by Australian police for potential ties to the Christchurch shooter.
The KCGOP apparently sees this travel restriction as persecution for "political reasons" and wants to help Pettibone, a constituent.
One wonders what kind of constituent services the party might offer Richard Butler, were he alive and exercising his First Amendment rights.
Obviously people are free to speak their mind. But supporting free speech does not require formally sanctioning the worst speech. It does not require that you forfeit your own right to freely speak about piles of manure in your front yard.
What the party leaders should do is separate themselves from a constituent who wildly, irresponsibly pushes one of the most dangerous online conspiracy hoaxes of our time, a raft of grotesque nonsense that led one man to drive to Washington, D.C., and shoot up a pizza restaurant to protect children from a supposed ring of pedophile murderers connected to  Hillary Clinton and George Soros.
Pizzagate is a gothic tale that is outrageous even for the far-right fever swamp. To believe it, you must believe that liberals - all of them, basically - participate in or sanction the beating, rape and murder of children. The media, naturally, approves of all of this child rape and murder as well and helps cover it up. Hillary Clinton, George Soros, John Podesta - a vast left-wing conspiracy of Satanic child abuse, all headquartered in a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant, Comet Ping Pong.
It's a very complicated theory, and a disheartening example of how powerfully lies take hold through online networks. The New York Times, among others, have tried to string it all together.
Pizzagate reached the peak of Bullflop Mountain when it was taken up by Alex Jones, who said this in a video: "When I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped, I have zero fear standing up against her. Yeah, you heard me right. Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children. I just can't hold back the truth anymore."
Jones would later apologize - to the owner of Comet Ping Pong.
Pettibone was one of the very first to push this conspiracy online when she was living in California. A Washington Post story credited her for coining the #PizzaGate hashtag on Twitter, helping to push the idea in some of the darkest corners of the idiot troll internet, where it exploded.
Her appearance on "The Matt Forney Show" - aired one day before the shooting - is just one example.
Forney is a white nationalist and anti-Semite, and not one of the sly ones who pretends he's a good guy. The Anti-Defamation League has cataloged some of his greatest hits, including a Holocaust denial video, "Eric Hunt-The Shoah: The Biggest Hoax of the 20th Century?" Forney also wrote a blog post titled "How to Beat Your Girlfriend or Wife and Get Away with It," and another piece in which he asserted, "Blacks do nothing but murder cops, rob and rape people, and bring death and destruction wherever they go."
A real free speech guy.
Pettibone went on Forney's show, in an episode that aired Dec. 5, 2016. Forney referred to her as "one of the leading authorities on Pizzagate."
Pettibone proceeded to ramble about Comet Ping Pong, which she alleges is the center of this vast ring of powerful American liberal Satanic pedophile/murderers. She would also occasionally veer off into noting that the vast ring of powerful American liberal Satanic pedophile/murderers are just one part of a vast global network of powerful Satanic pedophile/murderers.
They communicate with each other by a code of secret symbols, the members of this network. One key pedophile symbol just so happens to look like  a slice of pizza.
"I would have never thought pizza had other connotations," Pettibone tells Forney in all apparent seriousness.
She said that Comet Ping Pong is the center of a number of restaurants and other businesses, connected by tunnels, in which kidnapped children are taken and used in devil-worshipping rituals. She and Forney threw around the names of the business owners with abandon - many of them would wind up being harassed mercilessly by the army of online idiot trolls.
"The people that are all in power, they're all very similar to each other," Pettibone said, bringing it all together. "They like to keep their rings tightknit. It's not based off loyalty, though, it's based off blackmail. Many of them, it's been alleged, you know, proven in many instances, that many of these people have all this dirt on one another, so if anyone, you know, leaves the path, you know, or tries to go off do something they're not supposed to be doing, they can be kept in line by this dirt that everyone else has on them. They all have evidence on one another of doing illegal or questionable things, whatever, that maybe they don't want to get out. Scandals. That's the way they keep it in in my opinion. In many people's opinion."
The day after the interview, a North Carolina man drove to Washington, D.C., and fired an assault weapon into Comet Ping Pong. No one was hurt, miraculously. The shooter would later say, "The intel on this wasn't 100 percent."
Now the Kootenai County GOP wants to walk the purveyor of that intel down the aisle.

Texto completo: Ruth Reichl couldn't say no. When asked by Table to Table, the non-profit organization that helps feed the hungry in North Jersey, to be the honorary guest at its annual fundraising gala, Reichl, the last editor-in-chief of storied Gourmet magazine before it ceased publication, and the author of a new memoir, said : "Yes, of course."
The gala is scheduled for May 9 at the Edgewood Country Club in River Vale, where top-notch chefs will prepare a multi-course dinner. Among them are David Burke, executive culinary director of recently opened Ventanas in Fort Lee, and Ben Pollinger, chef/owner of The Hill in Closter.
Reichl was Gourmet's top editor for a decade, from 1999 until 2009 when Condé Nast announced it was shuttering the magazine. The news was not only a shock to the 70-year-old magazine's many fans, but Reichl herself.
"I have a hard time understanding why Condé Nast gave up on a magazine that had such an amazing connection with its readers," she said.
We caught up with Reichl, who is on a book tour for her Gourmet memoir, "Save Me the Plums," to ask about Conde Nast's famously lavish perks, what she looks for in restaurants and why Americans are finally obsessed with food.
What was the hardest part of being the editor of Gourmet magazine? Ruth Reichl: I was a newspaper writer. Most of the time, I sat at my computer by myself. Learning how magazines worked was huge. People at the magazine spoke a different language. I thought TOC was one word. I had to learn it stood for "Table of Contents."
Did you know what you wanted to do with the magazine? RR: Oh yes. Gourmet's motto used to be 'timeless.' I said, this is no time to be timeless. There's so much changing and happening in the world of food. I thought the magazine was stodgy. It needed to get a new generation of younger writers, literary writers. It needed to write about vacations, not just resorts and cruises. The magazine needed to give people useful advice, not just dreamy long recipes but also recipes for quick meals during the week. And the magazine needed to address important issues like genetic modification.
Condé Nast was famous for its amazing perks. What was that like for you? RR: It was as if my pumpkin turned into a carriage. I had a chauffeur. I had someone do my hair, my makeup. I had a wardrobe allowance. I knew it wouldn't last. I don't miss it. All that stuff was nonsense. What I miss is the joy of putting a magazine together with that group of people.
Do you think Americans are obsessed with food? RR: I don't. We Americans were oblivious to food, which is not normal. Cooking is the most basic human activity. We cook, animals don't. Most cultures are obsessed with food. We're making up for it now.
What changed? RR: Food TV. But I don't watch it. I spend enough of my real time with food.
What do you look for in a restaurant? RR: It depends what restaurant. People go to restaurants for different reasons. People go out for so much more than food. I love the restaurants that are virtually theater, like 11 Madison Park. Where the food is a surprise; you're entertained. Where the entire evening you wait for fireworks. I wouldn't want it all the time, but when you go to a three-star restaurant, what you want is the fantasy of being a wealthy person. You don't just want great food. You want to feel pampered, as if you were a Rockefeller. Other times you want to understand the culture of a different culture. You want to know what the food of, say, Karala tastes like.

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. is recruiting dozens of financial firms and online merchants to help launch a cryptocurrency-based payments system on the back of its gigantic social network.
The effort, should it succeed, threatens to upend the traditional, lucrative plumbing of e-commerce and would likely be the most mainstream application yet of cryptocurrency. It comes as the social-media giant is under intense pressure from regulators, users and shareholders to address privacy shortcomings.
At the heart of the initiative, under way for more than a year and code-named Project Libra, is a digital coin that its users could send to each other and use to make purchases both on Facebook and across the internet, according to people familiar with the matter.
Facebook's secretive plans for a new payments system involve both investments from traditional financial firms and the potential for users to be rewarded for their activity on the platform.
Hurdles to the project are high. Cryptocurrencies have so far failed to catch on in payments. The existing system is full of entrenched interests and technology clogs. And Facebook's battered standing with users, investors and regulators make it a delicate time to plow into new territory.
Working in its favor: One-third of the world's people log on monthly to Facebook, and they all need to buy things.
A spokeswoman for Facebook's blockchain efforts declined to comment, referring to a previous statement that it "is exploring many different applications."
Seeking total investments of about $1 billion, Facebook has talked to financial institutions including Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and payment processor First Data Corp., the people said. The money would underpin the value of the coin to protect it from the wild price swings seen in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they said.
Facebook is also talking to e-commerce companies and apps about accepting the coin, and would seek smaller financial investments from those partners, one of the people said.
Bloomberg News reported in December that Facebook was working on a digital coin that users of its WhatsApp messaging service could use to transfer money, with a focus on overseas remittances. The New York Times reported in February that the company was seeking to raise as much as $1 billion for the project.
Facebook is following rivals including Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. into the financial lives of its users. Each has explored or launched major financial products in the past year, joining with traditional financial firms to manage the logistics and regulatory burdens.
Facebook aims to burrow more deeply into the lives of its users. It is building a type of checkout option that consumers could use on other websites, some of the people said. Similar to how a Facebook profile can be used to log into hundreds of websites (including The Wall Street Journal), Facebook envisions allowing those credentials to be selected as a payment method when users buy goods online.
One idea under discussion is Facebook paying users fractions of a coin when they view ads, interact with other content or shop on its platform -- not unlike loyalty points accrued at retailers, some of the people said.
This would reward the kind of genuine interaction that Facebook, beset by bots and hate speech, has been trying to encourage. It could also blunt criticism that the company makes billions of dollars on the backs of its users, sometimes in troubling or invasive ways.
Creating a so-called stablecoin backed by government currency better positions it as a legitimate payment method rather than a speculative bet. The volatility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that aren't backed by hard assets has hampered their usefulness in payments.
Facebook has for years tried to crack into the payments markets, with discussions dating back to the run-up to its 2012 initial public offering. In 2014 it hired PayPal Holdings Inc. President David Marcus and has been adding engineers and products heads steeped in payments and blockchain in recent years.
Now Facebook must bend a variety of stakeholders to its vision. Most immediately are Visa and Mastercard Inc., whose networks handle the vast majority of credit and debit card payments in the U.S.
If it succeeds, the project threatens the card networks' dominance over global payments. Facebook comes armed with more than 1.5 billion daily users, many of them in developing countries where social-media sites provide the backbone of internet commerce.
The pitch to merchants is a break on fees, one of the people said. Facebook envisions eliminating swipe and other card processing fees that merchants pay on transactions, which are typically around 2% to 3% and are collected by banks, payments processors and networks such as Visa.
It is also working to tie online purchases more closely to ads. One idea being considered is that users could click ads to buy a product and pay with Facebook tokens, which the retailer could then recycle to pay for more ads, one person said. Facebook rolled out a similar feature -- using dollars and traditional card payments -- on Instagram, which it owns, in March.

Texto completo: When President Trump asked me to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I was honored. I never imagined the storm that would follow. The left and the media instantly launched a relentless campaign against me. Last week a reporter who has covered the Fed for 30 years told me he'd never seen anything like it. On Thursday I reluctantly threw in the towel and asked the president not to nominate me.
I knew that many of my ideas on monetary policy were controversial and outside the box. That's why the president picked me. My central argument is that economic growth does not cause inflation -- an assault on the core belief of the Keynesian economists at the Fed, whose fear of supply-side growth has often misdirected monetary policy, most recently late last year. As someone who worked with Mr. Trump as a senior economic adviser to his campaign, I am thrilled that 3% to 4% growth with stable prices has been achieved, and I believe it can be sustained. I also believe the Fed should stop targeting interest rates and instead focus on a stable dollar by following commodity prices along with other inflation measures as a leading indicator of whether prices are rising or falling.
I was naive. I believed that to be confirmed I would simply need to defend these ideas and my free-market economic philosophy in general. I relished that debate, especially because so many of my harshest critics were completely wrong about the Trump economy.
A majority in the Senate viewed my economic-policy expertise favorably, and my confirmation seemed likely. It helped my case that I had been one of the most outspoken critics of the Fed in December, when it raised interest rates. After a 4,000-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Chairman Jerome Powell early this year backed away from future rate increases and disavowed his December statement that the Fed's asset sales were on "autopilot." The market and the economy sprang back to life.
What did me in was not my economic ideas but gutter campaign tactics and personal assaults. I've been called an adulterer, a misogynist, a tax cheat, a deadbeat dad, antigay and mentally unfit. A Washington Post editorial warned that I was a "dangerous" pick for the Fed, and a columnist said I could cause a "global financial calamity." They must imagine I have superheroic powers of persuasion. If appointed, I would have been one of seven Fed governors.
Investigative reporters searched far and wide, digging through my 2,000 articles, 500 speeches and several thousand TV and radio appearances, some dating back more than 25 years, for dirt they could use. They found it. I have said and written things that were politically incorrect, sometimes foolish and hurtful. That was especially true about a 2002 article about women in sports. I meant it to be humorous but it was insulting, and I have apologized for it.
One irony is that one of my most vicious attackers has been CNN. In 2017 the network signed me to a two-year contract as a senior economic analyst. I appeared on the air more than 100 times, and CNN renewed my contract. As soon as Mr. Trump said he would nominate me to the Fed, the network began trashing me day after day for things I'd written decades before it hired me.
The low point of the sleaze campaign was when the media successfully persuaded the Fairfax County, Va., courts to unseal my divorce records from nine years ago -- over not only my objections but my ex-wife's. The Post, New York Times and others unfolded our dirty laundry on their pages -- never bothering to report that she and I are on amicable terms and often jointly attend our kids' events. Anyway, what do the details of my divorce almost a decade ago have to do with my suitability to help set monetary policy?
The sleuths in the media also tracked down spoof Christmas letters I wrote to friends and family in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These were outrageous and irreverent and poked fun at everyone and everything, including myself. In 2002 I wrote that I had bought a red sports car -- my "midlife crisis" car -- in which I cruised around town with my kids strapped into baby seats, trying to pick up women. Obviously I never did any such things, but reporters ignored the obvious humor and described it as evidence of sexism.
In their effort to portray me as sexist, they also contacted dozens of women I've known or worked with, and even girls I knew in high school. They failed to find one who impeached my character or behavior.
I realize now that I should have known better. Someone as outspoken as I am, and with a paper trail two miles long, is bound to be a target in today's political environment. I should have warned the president about skeletons in my closet.
Still, some good has come of all this. Because of all this attention, unwelcome as it was, my mantra that growth doesn't cause inflation seems to be taking hold. The Journal reported that more economists at the Fed are considering whether the economy can grow at a faster pace without spiking prices.
Tax cuts, deregulation, sound money and pro-business policies shift the supply of goods and services outward and increase the global demand for dollars. This in turn lowers prices. That was the lesson of the Reagan years, and we're now rediscovering it under Mr. Trump.
Chairman Powell, hold that thought and you'll be a great success.

Facebook Inc. is recruiting dozens of financial firms and online merchants to help launch a cryptocurrency-based payments system on the back of its gigantic social network.
The effort, should it succeed, threatens to upend the traditional, lucrative plumbing of e-commerce and would likely be the most mainstream application yet of cryptocurrency. It comes as the social-media giant is under intense pressure from regulators, users and shareholders to address privacy shortcomings.
At the heart of the initiative, under way for more than a year and code-named Project Libra, is a digital coin that its users could send to each other and use to make purchases both on Facebook and across the internet, according to people familiar with the matter.

Hurdles to the project are high. Cryptocurrencies have so far failed to catch on in payments. The existing system is full of entrenched interests and technology clogs. And Facebook's battered standing with users, investors and regulators make it a delicate time to plow into new territory.
Working in its favor: One-third of the world's people log on monthly to Facebook, and they all need to buy things.

Facebook has for years tried to crack into the payments markets, with discussions dating back to the run-up to its 2012 initial public offering. In 2014 it hired PayPal Holdings Inc. President David Marcus and has been adding engineers and products heads steeped in payments and blockchain in recent years.
Now Facebook must bend a variety of stakeholders to its vision. Most immediately are Visa and Mastercard Inc., whose networks handle the vast majority of credit and debit card payments in the U.S.
If it succeeds, the project threatens the card networks' dominance over global payments. Facebook comes armed with more than 1.5 billion daily users, many of them in developing countries where social-media sites provide the backbone of internet commerce.
The pitch to merchants is a break on fees, one of the people said. Facebook envisions eliminating swipe and other card processing fees that merchants pay on transactions, which are typically around 2% to 3% and are collected by banks, payments processors and networks such as Visa.
It is also working to tie online purchases more closely to ads. One idea being considered is that users could click ads to buy a product and pay with Facebook tokens, which the retailer could then recycle to pay for more ads, one person said. Facebook rolled out a similar feature—using dollars and traditional card payments—on Instagram, which it owns, in March.

Texto completo: Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee set up a chair and place card for Attorney General William Barr on Thursday, knowing the seat would remain empty because Barr had already refused to attend the hearing on special counsel Robert Mueller's report.
Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. , later added a glass chicken to Barr's empty place at the witness table, implying Barr was too afraid to testify. He also brought a bucket of KFC to the hearing and tweeted the night before about #ChickenBarr.
Barr's no-show came on the heels of Wednesday's contentious appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee where Democrats grilled the attorney general on the summaries of Mueller's conclusions that he supplied ahead of the redacted report's release, and his decision not to charge President Donald Trump with obstruction of justice.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said Barr had objected to being questioned by lawyers hired by the committee and to the possibility of extended questioning behind closed doors.

For Nadler, Barr's empty seat symbolized the "challenge" facing the Congress under President Trump. Citing the Trump administration's failures to honor congressional requests, and what he sees as the president's desire to render the body "inert as a separate and co-equal branch of government," Nadler said the nation is facing a "clear and present danger" to the constitutional order.
"History will judge us for how we face this challenge," Nadler said.
As we await history's verdict, here's a look back at some other famous, and infamous, empty chairs from our nation's political past:
Four empty seats at hearing on Watergate break-in
Even before President Richard Nixon's re-election in 1972, Rep. Wright Patman, D-Texas, was trying to get four Nixon aides to answer questions about the June break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters: former Attorney General and Nixon campaign committee chairman John Mitchell, Clark McGregor – who replaced Mitchell on the campaign, Nixon campaign fundraiser Maurice Stans and White House counsel John Dean.
The four men did not show up when Patman, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, summoned them to appear in October 1972 to answer questions about how Nixon campaign funds ended up in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars. The New York Times reported the first three men did not appear on the advice of their attorneys, while Dean claimed executive privilege.
Patman knew the men weren't coming, but he set up four empty chairs for them anyway and questioned them for an hour, a former investigator for Patman told Slate's "Slow Burn" podcast.
"President Nixon is responsible for those four empty chairs," Patman declared during the hearing, saying the administration had "pulled down an iron curtain of secrecy. "
Wilbur Ross skips Appropriations hearing
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross canceled a scheduled appearance before the House Appropriations Committee last month, offering to send his deputies to testify in his place. The committee rejected the offer and instead held a hearing with an empty seat marked for Ross.
Roll Call reported that Rep. José Serrano, D-N. Y. , addressed the empty chair and said, "Secretary Ross had no schedule conflicts to speak of and no other excuse other than the fact that he simply didn’t want to appear before this subcommittee and be held personally accountable. "
Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga. , lamented the decision not to allow Ross' aides to testify.
"You have people here, ready to answer the questions," Graves said, according to Roll Call. "Yet today’s hearing has to be about an empty chair, so maybe it’s a little bit more theater today and less about accountability and transparency," Graves also said.
Google skips Senate Intelligence hearing
Search giant Google and its parent company Alphabet outraged lawmakers in September when they refused to send Google CEO Sundar Pichai or Alphabet's chief executive Larry Page to testify before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on election interference.
While the top executives from other tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter showed up to answer senators' questions, Google was represented at the hearing with an empty chair.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , referred to the company as "the invisible witness. "
Clint Eastwood debates empty chair at 2012 RNC
Clint Eastwood's performance at the August 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay, Florida, was widely panned after the actor used his time on stage to debate an empty chair meant to represent then-President Barack Obama, who was seeking re-election.
The words "rambling" and "incoherent" were used by many commentators describing Eastwood's speech, which featured occasional exchanges with an invisible Obama.
When asked by Esquire in 2016 what "troubles" him most, Eastwood said, "I guess when I did that silly thing at the Republican convention, talking to the chair. "

Can the Dems still talk down the economy?

Texto completo: "The recession talk in late 2018 got way, way out of hand," New York Times economic reporter Neil Irwin tweeted a few days ago. Indeed it did. Irwin’s tweet came shortly after the government released figures showing the economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of this year. The number was good by anyone’s measure, significantly outpacing predictions. And it raised a question: What about all that recession talk of the last few months? What was going on?
Certainly, there were some economists who looked at various indicators — housing, energy, the international economy — and feared an economic slowdown was on the way. But in the popular conversation — the world of columnists and cable TV talkers — much of the economic chatter was really about President Donald Trump. A worsening economy, some said, would show how wrong the president’s policies have been and would be the worst possible news for his 2020 re-election bid. Now, though, the case is a bit harder to make, with 3.2% growth, plus low unemployment, plus — perhaps most important — wage increases that have not been seen in years.
Still, the presidential campaign is under way, and Democrats will try to portray — actually, they’ll have to portray — the president’s policies as an economic mess. The question is whether it will work. Republican strategists are of two minds. On one hand, some still bear the scars of the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton managed to convince voters that the economy, which was in the early stages of a recovery, was in desperate shape. The lesson: Creating a perception of the economy was more important than the economy itself.
On the other hand, some Republicans believe it will be difficult for any Democrat — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, anyone — to talk down a healthy economy.
"We, of course, have no idea what the economy will be like in a year and a half," said strategist Curt Anderson in another email exchange. "But if it stays similar to how it is now, the Democrats will not be successful in talking it down."
While an economic downturn would obviously hurt Trump, Anderson sees the possibility of another dynamic entirely.
"When the economy is good, voters don’t say that the economy is their No. 1 issue," he explained. "We have several polls this year where the voters list the economy as their third- or fourth-most important issue ... Often voters will migrate to other issues when the economy is good."
In that rather ironic scenario, a good Trump economy could give voters the freedom to focus on things they don’t like about the president.
In any event, Trump’s job will be to convince voters not only that his economic policies are working, but that Democratic proposals — the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, tuition-free college and more — would destroy the economy that has gone well during the early Trump years.
So far, despite all the pessimistic talk, that’s not a hard argument to make. And if the indicators hold up, the president will hold a strong hand, whatever his real or perceived liabilities, in November 2020.

Texto completo: Conservative commentator Stephen Moore has withdrawn from consideration for a position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Multiple Senate Republicans had expressed doubts about his prospects, citing among other issues his comments about women, as reported by CNN and other news outlets. Here is a sample.
Aug. 1, 1994 column for the Washington Times
"Probably the most objectionable pork in the entire legislation is the $1.8 billion earmarked for Sen. Joe Biden's 'Violence Against Women Act.' That act sets up gender sensitivity programs for judges and police; classifies assaults against women as 'hate crimes' or civil rights offenses, and passes out millions of dollars to women's groups for 'rape education' and a smorgasbord of other programs. The act would be more efficient if Congress cut out the federal middleman and simply required every American household to write a $20 check to the radical feminist group of its choice."
Nov. 7, 2000 column in National Review
Explaining that his wife voted for a Democrat: "Women are sooo malleable! No wonder there's a gender gap."
March 19, 2002 column in National Review
Writing about the "March Madness" NCAA college basketball tournament: "Here's the rule change I propose: No more women refs, no women announcers, no women beer vendors, no women anything. There is, of course, an exception to this rule. Women are permitted to participate, if and only if, they look like Bonnie Bernstein. The fact that Bonnie knows nothing about basketball is entirely irrelevant."
Nov. 21, 2013 speech at Brown University
"You all know the motto for Fox News, right, John? It's, uh, 'Fox News: Fair Balanced and Blonde.' Haha! I've met a lot of beautiful women at Fox News and it's one of the fringe benefits of working there."
April 10, 2014 column for National Review
"What are the implications of a society in which women earn more than men? We don't really know, but it could be disruptive to family stability. If men aren't the breadwinners, will women regard them as economically expendable? We saw what happened to family structure in low-income and black households when a welfare check took the place of a father's paycheck. Divorce rates go up when men lose their jobs."
July 19, 2016 debate at Republican National Convention
"I'd get rid of a lot of these child labor laws. I want people starting to work at 11, 12. It's amazing how many people I meet who are successful…who grew up on a farm and started working on a farm at age 10, 11, 12 years old where you learn a work ethic."
"If we do have a higher minimum wage, nationally…we must, must, must must have a policy that has a $6- or $7-an-hour teenage minimum wage because we're going to price a lot of those young people out of the workforce, and they're not going to get the training we need."
Nov. 13, 2016 event
"And by the way did you see that there's that great, um, cartoon going along that the New York Times headline: 'First thing that Donald Trump Does as President is Kick a Black Family Out of Public Housing?' And it has Obama leaving the White House? I mean, I just love that one. But uh — It's just a great one."
Shown a video clip of that speech on an episode of PBS's Firing Line with Margaret Hoover that aired April 30, 2019, Mr. Moore sought to defend himself, saying, "You know, that is a joke I always made about, you know, Obama lives in, you know, the president lives in public housing, but I didn't mean it like a black person did."
Aug. 17, 2017 appearance on CNN after Charlottesville riots
"I mean, Robert E. Lee hated slavery. He abhorred slavery, but he fought for his section of the country…The civil war was about the South having its own rights."
June 24, 2018 event
"Can I say something politically incorrect? Republican women are so much more beautiful than Democratic women."

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Biden in, Abrams out, Democrats in middle

Texto completo: On Monday afternoon, Joe Biden walked into the Teamsters Temple, home to Local No. 249 in Pittsburgh, and launched his third bid for president with a direct appeal to the union workers whom Donald Trump had won over in 2016.
Only a few hours later, at her home in Atlanta, Stacey Abrams picked up her phone and, one by one, began telling a handful of Georgia journalists and Democratic leaders -- state and national -- that she had decided against a U.S. Senate challenge to Republican incumbent David Perdue in 2020.
These were two independent, mostly unrelated actions. But they do have something in common. Both point to the possibility that the Democratic center, nationally and in Georgia, may not be as dead as many people think.
If you ask casual followers of politics what Biden and Abrams have in common, they will point to the trial balloon floated last month, which had the former vice president declaring the former Georgia candidate for governor to be his running mate -- right out of the gate. That was a bit of misdirection, obviously.
What Biden and Abrams actually share is strong, deep support from labor unions.
The 2016 presidential campaign showed an obvious gap between national union leaders, who backed Hillary Clinton, and a large percentage of union membership, who didn't.
Biden's kitchen-table relationship with blue-collar workers is something close to legendary. Before he gave his Monday union hall speech, Biden was endorsed by the International Association of Fire Fighters -- which sat out the 2016 presidential race, refusing to back Clinton.
"Joe's a lot like our firefighters," IAFF general president Harold Schaitberger said in the video that accompanied the endorsement. "He knows that a strong middle class means a strong America, and we know, as president, he will stand up for all the patriotic Americans."
Abrams sealed her relationship with Georgia's union membership while she was state House minority leader. On Feb. 22, 2012, to be exact.
A Republican lawmaker had introduced a bill that would have barred local governments from requiring union participation on major public works projects. "The bond requirements set by federal and state governments are too high for most of these small contractors to meet unless they are part of a union bid," she argued. Even with unemployment above 9%, Georgia would end up importing workers from out of state, she warned.
Her questioning of the bill's sponsor was so withering that, though it passed the House, the measure was mortally wounded and disappeared into the bowels of the Senate, never to be seen again. The Atlanta and North Georgia Building Trades Council, the most conservative organization under the Georgia AFL-CIO umbrella, was so delighted with Abrams that it sent DVDs of her state Capitol performance to all its members.
When Abrams began her run for governor in 2017, African-American women would be her primary target in the Democratic primary. But it was solid union support that gave Abrams an instant financial and organizational boost.
Union links have kept both Biden and Abrams tethered. During her run for governor, Abrams became skilled in the use of progressive vocabulary, but her ideas swam in the Democratic middle. Which is very much alive, said Charlie Flemming, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO -- an Abrams backer.
"I personally don't think it's dead. And I would argue that most of our members don't think it's dead," Flemming said. "The majority, I think, are in the middle."
A New York Times interview with Abrams was published over the weekend. "I'm a capitalist. I believe in our capital markets," she said. "I believe they need to be heavily regulated. I believe that avarice when left to its own devices is corrosive and that it will always outweigh conscience in our marketplace."
Save for that word "heavily," the above is a sentiment that could win an endorsement at any union gathering, and in many a church sanctuary. Adam Smith never argued that greed should be given free rein.
There will likely be more, but it is significant that, now that Abrams has left the field, the two most prominent Democratic candidates considering the U.S. Senate contest have solid centrist credentials.
Teresa Tomlinson, the former mayor of Columbus, is expected to formally enter the race today. She touts her record in reducing crime, reducing blight and keeping taxes low. She holds national security clearance with the U.S. Department of Defense -- something required when you live next to Fort Benning.
Sarah Riggs Amico, the former candidate for lieutenant governor, ran last year as a former Republican who is also an evangelical. And pro-choice, too.
Both Tomlinson and Amico are college-educated white women -- in a presidential year where that demographic will be highly courted. But Georgia also has a state Democratic party that is majority African-American. That is something that must be weighed.
But back to ideology.
Last Friday, DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond, who won three statewide races as state labor commissioner, was on GPB's "Political Rewind" with host Bill Nigut and me. We asked Thurmond, who is African-American, about the coming Democratic presidential primary.
"I think African-American voters are much more sophisticated than people perceive us to be -- and moderate, and they're going to look at the candidates," Thurmond said. "And like any other Democrat, we want to win."
So, I asked, Biden has a chance to win Georgia?
"Absolutely. I think he will. You have a moderate wing of the party that's reasserting itself, by the way. We focus on progressives, but what we're seeing is the moderates coalescing more," Thurmond said. "I'm talking to moderate Democrats -- white, black and other -- who are saying we've got to be more aggressive, to be more involved. Blacks know Joe Biden."
It is important to note that DeKalb County represents Georgia's largest cache of Democratic votes. We asked Thurmond if he himself was interested in making a bid for the U.S. Senate. (He ran and lost against Republican incumbent Johnny Isakson in 2010.)
Thurmond didn't say no -- just that he was awfully busy at the moment.
On Tuesday, I spoke with Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist with ties to Thurmond. We were very much of the same mind.
"Stacey Abrams did something very revolutionary in our state. You can't take that away from her," Johnson said. Her early and constant outreach to new voters, her targeting of flaws in the state's election system, her construction of a new biracial coalition -- all are things that need to be preserved and grown in the upcoming Senate contest, he said.
"But clearly, the national party is trying to figure out how to get back to the middle. You can't out-bully Donald Trump, but we do have candidates who can carry the Democratic message in a more moderate tone," Johnson said.
In essence, 2018 was a year in which Democrats learned that running to the left has its possibilities. Likewise, 2020 may determine whether it's the only possibility.

Texto completo: Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, trashed the New York Times over an anti-Semitic cartoon the news organization published last week.
Dermer said in a speech Monday that “one of the world’s most prestigious newspapers become a cesspool of hostility towards Israel that goes well beyond any legitimate criticism of a fellow, imperfect democracy.”
Ron Dermer
The cartoon Dermer was referring to was run by the Times on Thursday and featured President Trump wearing a yarmulke and being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is shown as a leashed service dog for the blind with a Star of David collar.
“The same New York Times that a century ago mostly hid from their readers the Holocaust of the Jewish people has today made its pages a safe-space for those who hate the Jewish state,” Dermer said. “Through biased coverage, slanderous columns and anti-Semitic cartoons, its editors shamefully choose week after week to cast the Jewish state as a force for evil.”
The Times initially acknowledged an “error of judgment” in publishing the cartoon, but then on Sunday offered a more thorough apology for publishing the cartoon, admitting that it was anti-Semitic.
We are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again,” the Sunday statement said. “Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it’s all the more unacceptable.”
Trump tweeted about the cartoon Monday, writing: “The New York Times has apologized for the terrible Anti-Semitic Cartoon, but they haven’t apologized to me for this or all of the Fake and Corrupt news they print on a daily basis. They have reached the lowest level of 'journalism,' and certainly a low point in @nytimes history!”

Marc Thiessen column: Impeaching Trump will only help him

Texto completo: Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."
This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia - evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president"? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa – Nearly a dozen years after being drubbed in the 2008 Iowa presidential caucuses, former Vice President Joe Biden returned to Iowa on Tuesday to present his case that he offers Democrats the best chance of beating President Donald Trump.
Early polls show Biden, who announced his candidacy last week, leads the crowded field of Democratic contenders. He raised $6. 3 million in the first 24 hours after launching his campaign, the largest first-day haul of any candidate in the Democratic field.
He’s racked up more than a dozen endorsements from members of Congress and the International Association of Firefighters, the first major labor group to announce its support for a 2020 presidential candidate.
Yet Biden's entry into the 2020 campaign isn’t exactly sending tremors through the Democratic field or the electorate in the very early going.
“I love Joe Biden, but the candidates we have seen so far have just been . . . really good Democratic candidates,” said Scott McCormick, 74, an undecided voter from Ankeny, Iowa, who said Biden isn’t among the top five candidates he’s mulling. “It’s going to be hard. "
Biden’s two previous runs for the White House crumbled early. He withdrew months before the 1988 Iowa caucus after allegations that he plagiarized part of a speech from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.
He finished fifth in Iowa in his 2008 White House run and ended his campaign days after the caucuses. Biden stumbled early in the campaign when he described then-candidate Barack Obama as the “first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. ”
Biden begins his third presidential campaign needing to demonstrate that he can avoid self-inflicted wounds and offer voters a compelling message that he’s best equipped to compete in battleground states for Obama voters who went for Trump in 2016, said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the political science department at Drake University in Iowa.
“Biden has more support among white, working-class Americans, but nevertheless, what is he saying to them?” Goldford said. “That’s not clear yet. ”
Clarence Thomas hearings: Joe Biden on Anita Hill: 'I don't think I treated her badly'
Opinion: Trump-era America needs Biden's campaign even if he doesn't win the Democratic nomination
More: Trump has made more than 10,000 false or misleading claims, according to report
Stating his case
Announcing his campaign launch in a video message last week, Biden stayed away from plugging his well-known biography or detailing policy goals. Instead, he called the upcoming election a “battle for the soul of this nation” and said Trump’s years in office will be recalled as an “aberrant moment in time” for the country.
During campaign events scheduled over the next three weeks, Biden is likely to offer more depth to his policy vision. He held his first major campaign rally Monday in Pittsburgh at a union hall where he talked about raising the minimum wage, expanding Medicare and rolling back tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
"The stock market is roaring, but you don't feel it," Biden said.
Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the moderate Democratic-aligned organization Third Way, said Biden, like all front-runners, entered the race with a target on his back. Kessler, who does not back any candidate, said Biden benefits from name recognition, affection from a sizable portion of the Democratic electorate and his service as President Obama’s vice president.
Kessler said Biden enters the race in a somewhat different position from previous favorites to win the Democratic nomination.
“He’s not a front-runner the way some Democrats have been in the past – where that person is seen as the hurdle you have to clear, say like Hillary Clinton was in 2016 and 2008 and Walter Mondale was in the 1984 race,” Kessler said. “The pundit class sees him as a weaker front-runner, but I think the support for Biden is a lot more solid than he gets credit for. ”
Nathan Teut, 37, an Iowa City resident who plans to participate in February's caucus, said he saw the prospect of a Biden presidency as an extension of Obama-era policies that would be a “stabilizing force” for the country.
In addition to Biden, Teut said, he’s giving serious consideration to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
“He’s not exciting, but he’d do a good job,” Teut said of Biden. “You can’t really get a more qualified person to run an administration. ”

Attacks from all sides
Even before officially entering the race, Biden was a target of Trump, who dubbed him “Sleepy Joe Biden. ” The president took to Twitter Monday before Biden's Pittsburgh speech to say the former vice president “obviously doesn’t know that Pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history, with lowest unemployment EVER, a now thriving Steel Industry (that was dead) & great future!”
Twitter fight: Donald Trump, Joe Biden battle on Twitter over labor unions, support of union members
Biden also faces incoming fire from fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls who question whether his record demonstrates he’s the best champion of the middle class in the field of 20 Democrats.
Last week, Warren highlighted Biden’s vote in the Senate backing the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, legislation that tightened rules on who could qualify for bankruptcy protection.
"At a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hardworking families who were in bankruptcy because of medical problems, job losses, divorce or death in the family, there was nobody standing up for them," Warren said at an event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "I got in that fight because they just didn’t have anyone. And Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies. "
In a fundraising note to supporters, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign took a thinly veiled shot at Biden for holding his first fundraiser of the campaign at the home of a “corporate lobbyist. ” David Cohen, a senior executive at Comcast, and his wife hosted the Biden fundraiser last Thursday, the same day Biden officially launched his campaign.
Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. , who launched his presidential campaign last week, called on Biden to apologize to Anita Hill, who appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee during Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1991. In her testimony, Hill alleged sexual harassment by Thomas and faced questioning by members of the all-male committee.
Hill spoke to Biden recently about the episode. She told The New York Times she was not satisfied with the conversation.
Biden, who was chairman of the Senate panel during Thomas’ confirmation, expressed regret for how Hill was treated but stopped short of directly apologizing to her when asked about the matter in an interview on ABC's "The View. " Biden said in an interview with "Good Morning America" that Hill "did not get a fair hearing. "
"She did not get treated well," Biden said. "That's my responsibility. ”
More than half of Democratic-leaning voters – 54% – say they haven't decided whom to support in next year’s nominating contests, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll published this week.
The fact that so many voters remain uncommitted tspeaks volumes about where the Democratic electorate stands, said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a left-leaning political action committee.
"He hasn't yet presented a vision that will resonate with the modern electorate," Chamberlain said. “The modern Democratic Party and America is looking for fighters that want to fight the status quo, that want to fight against the power structures in D. C. While America wishes Obama were still president, no one is looking to go back to the old school Democrat platform of corporate rule. Joe Biden’s support that is there is shallow and malleable. ”

No, David Bentley Hart, we can't relax about socialism

Texto completo: Writing in the New York Times on Saturday, an impressive theology scholar offered an unimpressive take on socialism.

In his very first paragraph, David Bentley Hart inadvertently explained socialism's critical flaw: its arrogant trust that government knows better than individuals. Hart decries how, at "smallish airports" in the Midwest, travelers are caught between Fox News' "bestial din" and the "T.S.A.’s gauntlet of gropers."

Griping about Fox News, Hart evidently believes the airport should be airing a different news network. Yet, assuming airport authorities air the news networks they believe the majority of travelers will prefer, this sot of undermines his point. The "bestial din" must be gone — the plurality of interests be damned.
David Bentley Hart.jpg

The gripe against TSA is more absurd. TSA is, quite literally, an organization made poor in service by socialism. The post-9/11 nationalization of airport security screening was unnecessary nationalization, and the result of Democrats' demands of the Bush administration. With the profit incentive for efficiency and merit now evaporated, airport security is badly organized, often poorly led, and largely unaccountable. When I visit smallish Midwest airports, for example, I'm often struck that many TSA officers are on duty. Why aren't they posted at busier airports where they could help provide more efficient screening amid higher traveler traffic? Because government thinks it knows best, yet it doesn't.

This theme of delusion sustains throughout Hart's piece.

He rightly identifies that the "health care cost per capita is far lower" in Europe than America, but fails to include Europe's corollary reality of aggressive triage-based access to care, lengthy waiting periods for treatment, and higher taxes. He also disingenuously ignores that the vast majority of medical drugs and devices used by Europeans are American-developed, American-manufactured and then subsidized by Americans for Europeans' benefit.

More broadly, Hart claims he has "lived abroad often enough to be conscious of the flaws in various nations’ social democratic systems. But I know too that those systems usually make possible something closer to a just and charitable society than ours has ever been."

This is manifestly untrue. American contributions to charity are far higher than those in Europe, and economic opportunity in America — both in post-tax earnings and capital formation — is also far greater. Moreover, Hart must not have stepped foot outside the Versailles palace if he believes Europe is a fiefdom of harmonious social intercourse. Racism, employment prejudice, and class tensions are much greater problems in Western Europe than in America.

And, in the finest tradition of Euro-wannabeism, Hart also appears to hate America. Lamenting "our unique national genius for stupidity," like European socialists, Hart fails to recognize that democratic socialism is only democratic by virtue of American military power. Instead, indirectly calling for appeasement of Xi Jinping's less-than-democratic ambition for global socialism, Hart wails about the "purchase of needless weapons systems." Some military programs are unnecessary, sure, but the democratic international order depends on more missiles and submarines — specifically, American ones, unless he wants to see Xi or Russian President Vladimir Putin control all of his favorite socialist countries.

Hart also defends Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., claiming that conservatives criticize her not because her ideas are bad, but rather "mostly because they suspect that in high school she was one of those girls they had no hope of getting a date with." Really?

Then, clarifying his own interest in getting a date with AOC, Hart adds "(though, really, she comes across as someone who could look past a face of even the purest suet if she thought she glimpsed a healthy soul behind it)."

I'm sure AOC means well, but her power in the Democratic Party reminds us of socialism's greatest flaw: It centralizes power in the hands of a very few individuals who aren't necessarily especially knowledgeable or bright, just well-connected. Humans are flawed. In contrast, when bound to the democratic rule of law, capitalism's market-driven interaction of many individuals ensures the best ideas ultimately triumph.

So no, sorry Hart, we can't relax about socialism.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
At the height of summer, when the boardwalk in Wildwood, N.J., is mobbed by beach-loving visitors, pretty much everything comes to a halt at 11 a.m.
That's when the sunscreen-drenched crowd falls silent, the cacophony of loud voices replaced by a patriotic medley blasted from the boardwalk's loudspeakers -- "The Star-Spangled Banner" followed by Kate Smith's famous version of "God Bless America."
The daily ritual, rooted in national pride, is a beloved local tradition. But it has now come under scrutiny after recent revelations that Smith's recording catalog featured racist songs.
Nevertheless, the town's mayor, Ernie Troiano Jr., insists that Wildwood had no plans to silence Smith.
"It is one of the most patriotic songs that was ever recorded," Mr. Troiano said. "Why would I want to change tradition?"
The mayor's stance differed from recent decisions by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Flyers to stop playing Smith's version of the song at their games after each team learned about the offensive songs, which were recorded in the 1930s.
Mr. Troiano's spirited defense of preserving his town's custom has placed Wildwood in the middle of a national cultural debate about political correctness and how America should reckon with its racist past.
"People obviously can change throughout their lives and have different viewpoints," said Safeer Quraishi, the administrative director of the New Jersey chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. "But it should not be lost on anyone that she went out of her way to record a few songs that had racist overtones."
Smith, who died in 1986, was one of the most popular singers of her time. She recorded almost 3,000 songs during her career, according to her obituary in The New York Times, but was most closely associated with "God Bless America."
The song was written by Irving Berlin during World War I but was first performed by Smith on her radio show in 1938. Her recording became so popular that it practically was an unofficial second national anthem.
Starting in 1969, the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team began playing Smith's "God Bless America," substituting it for "The Star-Spangled Banner" before games.
Smith also performed the song live at many Flyers games, including the one in which the team won its first Stanley Cup in 1974. Her association with the team became so strong that the Flyers erected a statue of the singer in front of their arena in 1987.
But beyond "God Bless America," Smith's recording library was extensive. Like many white singers of her time, she sang songs that most modern-day listeners would find offensive. Those included two songs with titles and lyrics that demean black people, "Pickaninny Heaven" and "That's Why Darkies Were Born," which was also recorded by the African-American singer and activist Paul Robeson.
After a fan alerted the Yankees to the songs, the team said it would stop playing Smith's version of "God Bless America" during the seventh-inning stretch. The Flyers followed suit, saying the songs were incompatible with the team's values. The team also removed Smith's statue outside its arena, though officials would not say where they took it.
But Wildwood's mayor said he would not be influenced by the choices of two high-profile sports teams.
"That's why they make chocolate and vanilla ice cream," the mayor said. "I will not question their decisions. They had their reasons to do it and we have our reasons.
"I'm not the Flyers, and I'm not the Yankees," he added. "I'm the city of Wildwood."
Mr. Troiano said that the history of Smith's songs cannot be erased. But Smith's recordings reflected, he said, the racial attitudes of her times, and she could not be faulted for that today.
"Eighty-eight years ago, she did something that was, at the time, an acceptable means of conversation," Mr. Troiano said. "I'm not saying it was right, but the times were different."
Songs like "Pickaninny Heaven" and "That's Why Darkies Were Born" were still fairly common in the 1930s, said Charles D. Carson, an associate professor of musicology and ethnomusicology at the University of Texas.
"It's pretty characteristic, especially for as famous as she was, of someone of that era," Mr. Carson, who teaches classes on American and African-American popular music.
But by the time Smith made her recordings, attitudes toward the songs, which derive from a tradition of blackface minstrelsy that began in the 19th century, had started to shift.
Amid a growing awareness that these stereotypical characterizations of African-Americans were offensive, some of the top performers of Smith's era started to pull away from songs, Mr. Carson said. Black audiences were particularly critical.
Still, songs like the ones Smith sang remained popular with many white audiences, Mr. Carson said. He was not surprised that Smith, who was known as the "Songbird of the South," recorded them.
"It would have been very on brand for her," Mr. Carson said.
It was not until the mid-1940s that popular culture began to abandon once-popular minstrelsy tropes, Mr. Carson said.
Around that time, in 1945, Ms. Smith gave a radio address cited by The Philadelphia Inquirer in which she deplored racism and bigotry and called on listeners to be more tolerant.
Mr. Quraishi said he had no quarrel with "God Bless America," but believed that Smith's version was tainted by her association with racist lyrics. Wildwood, he suggested, could use a different artist's recording of the song.
But Mr. Troiano said he was wedded to Smith's version, saying that he thinks it's the best. He also called Smith a patriot, noting that she had raised millions in war bonds during World War II.
"This woman was not a racist," he said. "I mean this woman, she gave a lot to her country. Hell, she got the Medal of Freedom."
Wildwood, a community of roughly 5,000 residents about 90 miles southeast of Philadelphia, sits on an island about five miles long. The city is a popular working-class beach resort destination -- Mr. Troiano called it the "blue-collar Riviera."
During summer weekends, hundreds of thousands of people swarm onto the island, said Tracey DuFault, the executive director of the Greater Wildwood Chamber of Commerce. Many of them are drawn to the hustle and bustle of the boardwalk, which stretches for nearly two miles.
Neither Ms. DuFault, who has lived in Wildwood for 14 years, nor Mr. Troiano, who was raised there, knew exactly when "God Bless America" began playing on the boardwalk.
Mr. Troiano, 68, said he remembered hearing the anthem as a child. He said that the tradition may have begun because Wildwood has long been home to many veterans.
Many of the people along the sparsely populated boardwalk on Tuesday afternoon -- the busy season won't start until next month -- said they had no objections to the mayor's decision.
Barbara Willemen of Prospect Park, N.J., who visits Wildwood often with her husband, said the "God Bless America" tradition should continue.
"This country was based on Christian principles," Ms. Willemen said. "I pray that we will be taken back to God. The country is getting away from that."
Kurt Schroter, 58, who was walking to his home in Wildwood after an afternoon at the beach, said Smith's past should not be held against her.
"We have to forgive and forget because people reflect the time they grow up in," he said.
Mr. Troiano is taking the issue one step further and is considering an idea floated by some of his constituents -- to make Wildwood the new home of the Smith statue evicted by the Flyers.
In an odd twist, Wildwood is not the only place on the Jersey Shore finding itself grappling with questions about Smith's legacy. Farther south, the Hume family, which owns and operates properties along a beach in Cape May Point, has held a nightly flag ceremony honoring veterans for more than 40 years.
Smith's version of "God Bless America" has long been part of the sunset tradition. But following the controversy, the Humes were considering whether to continue playing the song.
"We have not made a final decision," Larry Hume said in an email on Wednesday. "When we do it will be at our discretion."
Karen DeMasters contributed reporting from Wildwood, N.J.

Texto completo: LOSING EARTH: A Recent History, by Nathaniel Rich. MCD/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 206 pp. $25.
We are a culture awash in superhero and apocalyptic stories, even as the actual seas rise, the deserts surge, the storms intensify and the forests burn.
Nathaniel Rich has trafficked in such fictional scenarios, particularly his 2013 novel "Odds Against Tomorrow," and in the facts. He splashed down last August to occupy the entire New York Times Sunday Magazine with a searing, sober 30,000-word report, "Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change."
It is now expanded into a crisp, absorbing but still slim book "Losing Earth: A Recent History." In either format, it is essential reading.
"The Red Cross estimates that already more refugees flee the environmental crises than violent conflict," Rich writes. "Starvation, drought, the inundation of the coasts, and the smothering expansion of deserts will force hundreds of millions of people to run for their lives."
We failed, he argues, to solve this problem when we could: "For in the decade that ran between 1979 and 1989, we had an excellent chance. The world's major powers came within several signatures of endorsing a binding framework to reduce carbon emissions - far closer than we've come since."
The book samples the surprisingly early and frank consensus that our fossil-fuel habit was altering the atmosphere, ocean and land into a planet that "would soon cease to resemble itself."
To carry this story, Rich identifies two protagonists: Rafe Pomerance, an energetic lobbyist for Friends of the Earth with zero scientific training, and James Hansen, a mild-mannered climatologist. Hansen was 38 in 1979; Pomerance was 32. (Intriguingly, both men resemble Rich's fictional Mitchell Zukor, a brilliant disaster forecaster who anchors "Odds Against Tomorrow" as a future Manhattan floods.)
Back in the real world, circa 1980, Pomerance flew to a gathering of two dozen experts on Florida's Gulf Coast to suggest climate change legislation. One Stanford engineer framed it as an economic question: How much do we value the future?
Rich recounts the discussion: "We have less time than we realize, said an MIT nuclear engineer named David Rose, who studied how civilizations responded to large technical crises. 'People leave their problems until the eleventh hour, the fifty-ninth minute,' he said. 'And then: Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'"
In this telling, Jesus's Aramaic lamentation, "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" pairs nicely with the general human impulse to put our heads in the sand.
Of course, as Rich reports it, ExxonMobil was working the fog-machine on the other side of the street: "The dominant narrative for the last quarter century has concerned the unrestrained efforts of the fossil fuel industry, compounded by the ingratiating abetment of the Republican Party, to suppress scientific fact, confuse the public, and bribe politicians."
A big assist came from John Sununu, George H.W. Bush's chief of staff, who scuttled that aforementioned best chance: the 1989 International Planet Protection Convention in the Netherlands.
A decade earlier, when the Gulf Coast gathering broke apart around quarrelsome semantics, Pomerance determined the planet "needed a hero. He just had to find one." Enter Hansen.
Some critics have dinged Rich for this comic-book approach, embedded in a savior trope beloved of American white male elites. And he seems to have responded in his afterword, writing that "there will eventually emerge a vigorous, populist campaign" to combat the eco-villains.
But it feels wrongheaded to be distracted from the story by its structure. This is no science book; there are no charts, let alone equations. This is a well-told tale that grapples with Aristotle's fundamental insight that humans are political animals - and asks whether we can finally, collectively, rouse ourselves to act.

Texto completo: The Bay Area News Group publisher of the Mercury News and East Bay Times received national honors Thursday from the Society of Professional Journalists for its exclusive look last year at police body-camera video from the deadly Wine Country fires.
"You just gotta get out of here" was awarded a 2018 Sigma Delta Chi Award for Online Non-Deadline Reporting the second national award for the immersive multimedia project, which also received a 2018 EPPY.
The recognition comes a week-and-a-half after the Bay Area News Group and the staff of its partner newspaper the Chico Enterprise-Record were named finalists for a Pulitzer Prize in the Breaking News category for their collaborative coverage of last year's devastating Camp Fire.
Reporters Julia Prodis Sulek and Matthias Gafni, video producer Randy Vasquez and web designer Pai teamed up to produce "You just gotta get out of here," bringing to light heroic rescuers and harrowing escapes and helping explain why people in danger sometimes don't flee. Through vivid multimedia, the project illuminated the life-and-death choices Californians may soon face before and after the next big wildfire.
"We're humbled by this recognition from SPJ," said Frank Pine, executive editor of the Bay Area News Group and Southern California News Group. "We hope our reporting in the wake of this tragic firestorm will help ensure our readers are better prepared should they ever face such an incredible disaster."
The award was the second in two years from the Society of Professional Journalists for Prodis Sulek, who took home a Sigma Delta Chi last year for her six-part narrative series and podcast "Hanging: The mysterious case of the boy in the barn."
The Sigma Delta Chi Awards recognized the best journalism in 2018 from newspapers, online news sites, television and radio broadcasts, and magazines. Other winners included work from the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Reveal from the Emeryville-based Center for Investigative Reporting. Winners will be honored in June at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

MEASLES CASES IN ADULTS ON RISE

Texto completo: Measles cases are on the rise statewide this year, with 15 new cases reported just last week. And those numbers reveal a disturbing new trend: About three-quarters of this year's 38 reported cases occurred in adults who had never received vaccinations or had partial vaccinations.
California public health officials said Thursday that the San Francisco Bay Area has reported 10 confirmed cases of measles this year, most of them linked to unvaccinated adults exposed through international travel. Four were in Santa Clara County, four in San Mateo County, one in San Francisco County and one in Santa Cruz County.
"If you are traveling to a part of the world with elevated measles cases, you should know if you are vaccinated," said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health.
This year's pattern of disease is different than in prior years, when the majority of cases were seen in unvaccinated children.
Health officials worry that infected adult travelers could transmit it to children, who could spread the highly contagious virus through day care facilities and schools. UNICEF reported Thursday that "nearly 170 million children worldwide, including more than 2.5 million in the United States and half a million in Britain, missed out on the first dose of the measles vaccine during the past eight years," according to a story in The New York Times.
The measles cases were brought to California from people who visited the Philippines, Thailand, India, Ukraine and Cambodia, where very large measles outbreaks are occurring, Smith said.
"We have an adult population that is unvaccinated in California," she said. "When that pool of unvaccinated adults travels to places where there there is an outbreak  it is imported into California."
Many adults attended school before vaccines were mandatory, she explained. Others moved here from parts of the world where vaccines are less available.
Measles, a preventable disease, once had been effectively eliminated from our country. Now it is resurging.
New cases in the United States have exceeded the highest number on record in a single year since the disease was thought to have been eliminated in 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday.
Nationwide, 695 cases of the illness have been reported in 22 states this year, according to the CDC. That's more than the 667 cases reported in all of 2014, another dangerous year.
The largest outbreak is in New York City, centered in a predominantly Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, with 334 cases there this year, according to The New York Times. Authorities link it to travel to an annual Hasidic pilgrimage from Israel to Ukraine, nations with major outbreaks.
In a typical year, California experiences between 10 and 25 cases. There were only 22 cases all of last year. The last major outbreak was in 2015, with 125 cases.
There was a major uptick last week, with 15 new cases reported statewide, Smith said. That compares with 11 cases at this time in 2018.
Of the 38 2019 cases, 14 were in international travelers, 22 were spread from travelers to people in California, and two are of unknown origin.
In addition to the 10 Bay Area cases, other affected California counties include Los Angeles with six cases and Placer and Sacramento with three cases each. There have been 16 total cases in Butte, Shasta, Tehama and Calaveras counties.
On Thursday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a quarantine for the UCLA and Cal State Los Angeles campuses because of possible exposure to a student who was infected, according to a news report by ABC7. The quarantine affected more than 100 people who will be tested for immunity to the disease, the station reported.
While most of this year's cases did not trigger large outbreaks of the disease, there were four incidents, including one in the Bay Area, where one sick person spread it to more than three other people. That Bay Area outbreak is now over.
Health officials confirmed in March that at least three Bay Area residents in Santa Clara, San Francisco and Santa Cruz counties contracted measles, two of them from the other person on the same airplane flight. In February, a Santa Cruz County resident with measles was on an international flight that landed at San Francisco International Airport, according to the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. It's unclear whether that person knew he or she had measles at the time. Since then, two other passengers on that flight caught the disease one from San Francisco and the other from Santa Clara County.
About 65 percent of infected Californians had not been vaccinated, said Dr. Gil F. Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases. About 10 percent had just one dose of the two-dose vaccine. The rest had been vaccinated but were not fully protected, he said.
Exceedingly contagious, the measles virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person who may not yet feel sick has left a room.
"That is why we pay so much attention to vaccination," Smith said. "It is the single most powerful tool to protect public health."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Former Vice President Joe Biden opened his presidential campaign Thursday by pointing to a "battle for the soul of this nation," in what may be the last major addition to a sprawling lineup of Democratic candidates competing to challenge President Trump in 2020.
Mr. Biden's entry means the Democratic contest is largely set, putting the former vice president into a scramble for the nomination against a diverse field of candidates who have been competing and raising money for months. The contest already is revolving around who is most likely to unseat Mr. Trump, with primary voters debating how far left a winning nominee might go.
Mr. Biden made his long-awaited announcement in an online video , casting Mr. Trump's comments praising "both sides" after the 2017 violence in Charlottesville, Va.—where hundreds of white nationalists staged a protest against the planned removal of a Confederate statue that led to street fighting and left one woman dead—as a national emergency that demanded a change in leadership.
"I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time," Mr. Biden said in the video, posted nearly 32 years after he began his first presidential campaign in June 1987. "But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen."
After Mr. Biden's announcement, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, "Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe," and suggested he lacked the intelligence to win the primary.
Speaking with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday night, Mr. Trump, referring to Mr. Biden's comment about the country's "soul," said there had been "tremendous division" during the Obama administration and added: "We actually have great spirit right now."
Mr. Biden enters the campaign with a reservoir of goodwill among Democrats after eight years as Mr. Obama's vice president and 36 years of service as a U.S. senator from Delaware. Early polls have shown him as a leading contender for the nomination, helped by his broad name recognition.
Who's Running in 2020
Mr. Biden nonetheless will face a number of hurdles at the start of his campaign. His Democratic rivals have had a head start on fundraising for several months. His centrist Democratic politics—supportive of the Affordable Care Act and the Paris Agreement on climate change, for example—may not sit well with some liberal activists in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. These voters champion Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, a far-ranging effort to reshape the U.S. economy within 10 years to release net-zero carbon emissions.
Justice Democrats, an advocacy group that backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, said it would oppose Mr. Biden's candidacy: "The old guard of the Democratic Party failed to stop Trump, and they can't be counted on to lead the fight against his divide-and-conquer politics today."
In recent weeks, Mr. Biden has faced allegations from seven women that he inappropriately touched them or made close contact. Mr. Biden, who is known for his tendency to touch people, didn't apologize but said that he would be " more mindful and respectful of people's personal space."
If elected, Mr. Biden would be the oldest person to enter the White House. He is currently 76 years old, four years older than Mr. Trump and a year younger than Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
On his first day, Mr. Biden picked up endorsements from a handful of senators, including Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons from his home state of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Doug Jones of Alabama.
His supporters, meanwhile, sought to create a show of force in fundraising, mindful of Mr. Biden's need for a strong start. "There's been a huge amount of activity," said Steve Westly, a former California state controller who is raising money for Mr. Biden's campaign, though he provided no specifics. "Fundamentally, people believe in Joe Biden, and fundamentally, people believe the United States is in a very serious position and they need someone experienced for the job."
Mr. Biden attended a private fundraiser in Philadelphia on Thursday that was organized by former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and several longtime supporters .
Mr. Biden is chasing rivals who have made headway in fundraising, particularly among donors who give in small amounts: Mr. Sanders has taken an early lead, amassing more than $18 million during the quarter ended in late March, while Sen. Kamala Harris of California collected more than $12 million and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas brought in $9.3 million.
Mr. Biden is slated to hold his first public campaign event Monday in Pittsburgh, where he plans to address union workers, followed by a trip to Iowa. After visiting Iowa, Mr. Biden plans to travel to South Carolina, Nevada, California and New Hampshire and then hold an event in Philadelphia on May 18.
His early schedule will include a number of fundraisers, including a May 8 event in Beverly Hills, Calif., at the home of designer Michael Smith and his husband, James Costos, who served as U.S. ambassador to Spain during Mr. Obama's second term, according to an invitation viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Co-hosts include former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, director Rob Reiner and Peter Chernin, the former president and chief operating officer of News Corp, which is the Journal's parent company.
In the months leading up to his announcement, Mr. Biden said he would run as an "Obama-Biden Democrat," seeking to cast himself as a healing figure for a divided nation and restoring many of the Obama-era policies that have been reversed or challenged by Mr. Trump's administration.
Mr. Obama isn't expected to issue an endorsement of Mr. Biden, or any Democratic candidate, during the primaries. Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said that the former president "has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made. He relied on the vice president's knowledge, insight and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last 10 years and remain close today."
Mr. Biden spoke briefly to reporters at the Amtrak station named for him in Wilmington, Del., where he arrived from Washington, D.C., Thursday morning. The former vice president said that he had asked Mr. Obama not to endorse him, preferring to let the race develop without the former president's early input.
As vice president, Mr. Biden often served as the administration's emissary to working-class voters in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin—states that proved crucial to Mr. Trump's triumph in the 2016 election. If Mr. Biden can win the Democratic nomination, he will compete for those blue-collar voters who helped propel Mr. Trump to the presidency.
In the primaries, the former Delaware senator will seek the nomination of a party that has embraced a more expansive government role in health care, education and the environment in recent years. Mr. Biden is also expected to face scrutiny of his lengthy record in Congress—including his handling of Anita Hill's testimony concerning sexual-harassment allegations during the 1991 Senate confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. In addition, Mr. Biden's support for the 1994 crime bill has been criticized by some African-Americans as contributing to the mass incarceration of members of black communities.
Mr. Biden has spoken to Ms. Hill and "he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country," said Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden's deputy campaign manager. Ms. Hill didn't respond to requests for comment, but in an interview Wednesday with the New York Times she said she wasn't satisfied with what he said to her.

Buttigieg Battles Mike Pence, or So He Imagines; Mayor Pete picks a fight with a caricature of the vice president that he knows from experience is false.

Texto completo: Vice President Mike Pence and 2020 Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg have been embroiled in a notable fight over the past few weeks—"notable" mostly because the vice president hasn't been involved.
Mr. Buttigieg went after Mr. Pence unprompted at the LGBTQ Victory Fund's National Champagne Brunch April 7. Referring disparagingly to "the Mike Pences of the world," the South Bend, Ind., mayor told the audience that the former governor has a "quarrel" with him because Mr. Buttigieg is gay.
Mr. Pence's response? "I've known Mayor Pete for many years," he told CNN. "I considered him a friend. He knows I don't have a problem with him."
For years, Democrats have engaged in these sorts of shadow-boxing matches against Mr. Pence, swinging their arms at a hateful caricature that doesn't exist. To Republicans' amusement, the vice president's would-be adversaries have yet to get much of a rise out of him—and little wonder, he is one of the more polite and good-natured people in Washington. Yet the media eagerly cover these fights as if they were one-on-one, even though they're one-on-zero.
When Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon last year criticized Mr. Pence's alleged past support for conversion therapy, the New York Times published a headline: "Mike Pence Tangles With Olympian Adam Rippon Over Gay Rights Record." In reality, Mr. Rippon's comments seem to have come unprompted, and Mr. Pence responded by tweeting to Mr. Rippon: "I want you to know we are FOR YOU . . . I am proud of you." That's some tangle.
The media even turn amicable meetings into dramatic showdowns. The website NowThis News implied that Mr. Pence was uncomfortable at a reception with the head of Ireland's government, posting a video of the encounter and inviting its readers: "Please enjoy Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar bringing his boyfriend to meet Mike Pence." The same thing happened when Mr. Pence swore in Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who is bisexual. "He seems uncomfortable and she's having fun with it," tweeted Adam Best, a co-host of a left-leaning podcast.
Yet on both occasions Mr. Pence acted with grace and dignity. He praised Mr. Varadkar's partner for his work at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and the prime minister told reporters afterward that the Pence family said the couple were "welcome to visit their home in the future," calling it "a very nice gesture." Mr. Pence laughed with Ms. Sinema when the senator, who is single, pointed to the "spouse" sticker used when married senators are administered the oath and jokingly asked the audience: "Could we get a spouse?"
The sustained, one-sided assault Mr. Buttigieg has launched in recent weeks is particularly low because he knows the man behind the caricature, a fellow Hoosier, very well. In 2015, when asked his thoughts about Mr. Buttigieg's "coming out," then-Gov. Pence said without hesitation: "I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. We have a great working relationship. I see him as a dedicated public servant and a patriot."
The portrait Mr. Buttigieg paints of Mr. Pence now that he's running for the White House differs dramatically from his previous descriptions of the man. On meeting Mr. Pence for the first time in 2011, Mr. Buttigieg wrote, "I was surprised by how affable, even gentle he seemed." He later said that Mr. Pence was "noticeably moved by my deployment" to Afghanistan in 2014 and that he personally called Mr. Buttigieg on his drive to the military base. By contrast, last month the mayor wondered aloud if Mr. Pence "stopped believing in Scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump."
If the average Democrat wants to swing at a cardboard cutout of the vice president to boost his fundraising numbers, then so be it. But for Mr. Buttigieg to question the faith of a man he knows better than most after a close, yearslong working relationship is shameful. The mayor knows better, and his insults say far more about his character than about the vice president's.

Texto completo: "Gotham" comes to an end on Fox. And "Shrek Forever After" is on Freeform.
What's on TV
GOTHAM 8 p.m. on Fox. Since its beginnings in 2014, this Batman origin story series has traced the transformations of a young Bruce Wayne and James Gordon into Batman and the police commissioner. The show started as an intimate crime drama, but its fifth and final season has Wayne (David Mazouz) and Gordon (Ben McKenzie) dealing with a large-scale problem: a city overrun by villains. These include standbys like Bane (Shane West) and the Riddler (Cory Michael Smith). The final episode promises to complete Wayne and Gordon's transformation, and put a cap on a dark show that has found success in resisting some of the superhero genre's tropes. "It doesn't matter what the other shows do," McKenzie told The New York Times in 2017. "'Gotham' is taking the biggest piece of red meat in the comics world, Batman, and trying to take this one specific sliver of it and cook it really, really well and serve it to you."
SHREK FOREVER AFTER (2010) 9 p.m. on Freeform. The original "Shrek" arrived 18 years ago, when audiences first watched the Gingerbread Man (Conrad Vernon) spit in the face of the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) and say "Eat me!" That animated family movie birthed a franchise that ended (at the time) with this fourth installment. Mike Myers voices the big green ogre Shrek, who returns with Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and the many fairy-tale characters who populate their universe. The villain in this one is Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn).
What's Streaming
SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE (2018) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Spider-Man is reimagined as Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), a Brooklyn boy, in this well-received animated film. The story involves the convergence of spider-somethings from alternate universes, including Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), a Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld) and Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage). "The original Spider-Man, an upwardly striving, working-class New York kid, was also a child of the '60s, a beacon to outsiders and rebels of every color and background, an instinctive democrat and a natural pluralist," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "More recently, Marvel, in print, movies and television adaptations, has tried to make inclusiveness a central aspect of fan culture and corporate practice. 'Spider-Verse' accomplishes this without awkwardness, preening or preaching."
THE SHIPMENT Rent on OntheBoards.tv. The library of this streaming service is filled with filmed theater shows, many of them from audacious New York artists. A good place to start is this 2009 production of a comedy by Young Jean Lee, which subverts racist clichés for smart laughs. Also on the service: "Whatever, Heaven Allows," a beer-slathered mash-up of John Milton's "Paradise Lost" and Douglas Sirk's "All That Heaven Allows" from the downtown theater stalwarts Radiohole.

Five Letters, Starts With D: Clues Chosen by Bored Crossword Solvers --- Some fill only the down clues as training; others just want the challenge

Texto completo: Daryl Sng wanted to get faster at crossword puzzles. So he decided to train by ignoring half the clues.
"It's like if you're on a football team and you say, 'I'm only going to pass, I'm not going to allow myself to run,'" said Mr. Sng, a 41-year-old consultant who lives in Bethesda, Md.
Mr. Sng is among serious puzzle fans -- in their parlance, "solvers" -- who regularly do crosswords by consulting only the down clues. The idea of ignoring the acrosses has been quietly known to competitive puzzlers for decades. Within the past year, solvers say, the practice has taken off.
For some, it is a training tool, like a sprinter strapping on ankle weights. Others just want a challenge.
"Sometimes the regular puzzle doesn't provide the thrill it used to," said Jenna LaFleur, 20, a linguistics major at University of California, Los Angeles and occasional downs-only solver.
For other cruciverbalists, it's the equivalent of savoring a gelato with a tiny spoon. "You do it downs only and you get a much longer solving time and much more enjoyment," said Peter Gordon, 52, a puzzle-book editor who lives in Great Neck, N.Y. Mr. Gordon is an editorial director for a company that publishes collections of Wall Street Journal crosswords.
Will Shortz, the crossword-puzzle editor at the New York Times, solves downs only a couple times a year when on vacation in his hometown of Crawfordsville, Ind.
"The local paper has a very easy puzzle," said Mr. Shortz, 66, who lives in New York.
The practice took off last year after Erik Agard, champion of the 2018 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, live-streamed his downs-only solving of the Newsday Saturday Stumper, regarded by many solvers as the week's consistently most difficult puzzle.
"It was just really hard and I like attention," said Mr. Agard, 25, of Gaithersburg, Md. He broadcast his solving on Twitch, a website that is commonly used by videogamers.
After several hours, Mr. Agard, who typically solves the Stumper in less than 15 minutes, was stumped.
Viewers loved it. "It was like an epic battle," said Joon Pahk, 40, a puzzle maker in Somerville, Mass.
The public airing of strategy, process and (gasp) mistakes drew a devoted, albeit small, audience. Thanks to the live-stream sessions, Twitter banter and word of mouth, downs-only solving caught on among serious puzzlers.
It may become official this August. An organizer of the annual Lollapuzzoola crossword tournament in New York City is drumming up participants for a downs-only division.
While doing puzzles using just the across clues isn't unheard-of, that notion hasn't caught on, solvers say. In many crosswords, the across clues have a theme, which can include puns or made-up words and phrases.
"These are harder to infer," said Andy Kravis, 30, a puzzle maker who lives in Brooklyn. Also, he said of downs-only solving, "It's sort of the fashion."
There are practical challenges, like how to shield from view half of the clues. Some just try not to peek.
Mr. Pahk sometimes tapes a sheet of paper over the across clues.
Brooklyn resident Parker Higgins wrote a software program, called Cursewords, that can strip out across clues from digital puzzle files.
"I wanted to make it so I could rigorously do downs-only crosswords whenever I saw fit," said Mr. Higgins, 31, director of special projects at the nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation. The software has been downloaded thousands of times.
Mr. Higgins said he completes a New York Times Monday puzzle (the easiest of the week) in about four minutes when using all the clues. When solving downs only, it takes him more than double that.
Solving downs only isn't just about being able to conjure answers out of thin air. Experienced solvers say it develops pattern recognition because one is required to suss out the across possibilities from just a handful of letters.
One morning in mid-April Michael Sharp, an English professor in Binghamton, N.Y., who writes a crossword blog under the name Rex Parker, began his day with a cup of green tea and a puzzle in The Wall Street Journal that he tackled using only the downs. He quickly figured out 11 Down, "Singer on '25.'"
"I knew Adele was right," said Mr. Sharp. For 12 Down, a five-letter word for cooking fats, he tried "oleos." But the "d" in Adele and "l" in oleos, which would have formed the final letters of 15 Across, were a red flag.
"Having a 'dl' at the end of your answer is either Ivan Lendl or you're screwed," said Mr. Sharp, 49, referring to the retired Czech-American tennis player.
Some call downs-only solving a stunt. Others say if a puzzle is a work of art, those who solve only its downs are missing half the canvas.
As for Mr. Sng, the consultant, solving downs-only boosted his speed. Still, sometimes the across clues beckon.
"I feel like you shouldn't do it for some puzzles," he said.Among them are the New Yorker crosswords, which he admires for literary and cultural references.
In a New Yorker puzzle earlier this month, he said, a downs-only solver would have missed beauties such as "Allusive Beatles song with the line 'the Walrus was Paul.' "
Mr. Agard, the 2018 champion, said a solver could have his downs-only and acrosses too: "You can always look at the across clues after you're done solving."

Texto completo: The Boy Scouts have kept files going back decades showing that nearly 8,000 volunteers have been excluded from the organization because they had been accused of sexually abusing children, according to a review by an expert on child sexual abuse.
The expert, Janet Warren, a professor at the University of Virginia, revealed the scope of the reported abuse when she testified as an expert witness in a trial involving allegations of child sexual abuse at a children's theater in Minneapolis.
Her findings were described on Tuesday by a lawyer, Jeff Anderson, who has represented sexual abuse victims in cases against organizations like the Boy Scouts and the Roman Catholic Church.
Ms. Warren said during her testimony that she had been hired by the Boy Scouts and spent five years reviewing data known as the "perversion files" that contained information on volunteers whose involvement in the group had been ended "because of reasonable allegations of child sexual abuse."
The Boy Scouts have kept such files since just after World War I. She reviewed 72 years' worth of documents, from 1944 to 2016, and said they contained the names of 7,819 "perpetrators." She said there had been 12,254 victims in that time.
The issue of sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts received widespread attention several years ago, and much of the disclosures on Tuesday were not entirely new. But Ms. Warren appeared to have made more headway in analyzing the Scouts' files.
Her testimony went largely unnoticed until Mr. Anderson, whose firm had brought the case against the children's theater, discussed Ms. Warren's findings at a news conference in Manhattan. Mr. Anderson did not say why he had released the list at this time, but he noted that New York State recently passed a law making it easier for victims to sue their abusers.
A portion of the Boy Scout files had already been made public in 2012 as a result of a trial in Oregon involving sexual abuse allegations against a Scout leader.
Mr. Anderson provided a list of 130 names of scout leaders in New York State who he said had been accused of sexual misconduct that had been gathered from publicly available documents. It is unclear whether the allegations against those people have been substantiated. His list did not indicate whether any of the 130 people had been criminally charged with abuse.
The Boy Scouts said in a statement on Tuesday that every account of suspected abuse has been reported to law enforcement agencies. That includes accounts in the files where it was not clear whether information had been turned over to the appropriate authorities.
"We care deeply about all victims of child abuse and sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in scouting," the Boy Scouts said in a statement. "Nothing is more important than the safety and protection of children in scouting, and we are outraged that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our programs to abuse innocent children."
"At no time have we ever knowingly allowed a perpetrator to work with youth," the statement said.
The statement also said that the Boy Scouts have paid for "unlimited counseling" for victims by providers of their choosing, and have also provided a toll-free number that victims can call.
About 2.2 million children and nearly a million volunteers are members of the Boy Scouts, according to the organization.
News outlets that reviewed the files released in 2012, including The Los Angeles Times and The Associated Press, said they indicated that some local prosecutors and police officials had protected scouting volunteers accused of abuse, sometimes out of concern that negative publicity would hurt scouting.
But the same files also contained unsubstantiated allegations, which differentiates this situation from what has occurred with the Roman Catholic Church.
In recent months, following a grand jury report in Pennsylvania that said bishops and other Roman Catholic leaders had covered up child sexual abuse by more than 300 priests, a number of bishops across the country have released the names of priests in their dioceses who they said have been credibly accused of abuse. That was a step that abuse victims and their advocates had long sought.
Mr. Anderson said on Tuesday that the Boy Scouts "have never actually released these names in any form that can be known to the public."
"They may have removed them from scouting," he said. "They may have kept them in their perversion file, but they never alerted the community."
Mr. Anderson's appearance came two months after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a bill that gave sex abuse victims new opportunities for justice.
Under the new law in New York, prosecutors can bring criminal charges until a victim turned 28. New York's age limit had been among the most restrictive in the nation: Criminal or civil charges had to be filed before the victim's 23rd birthday. As for civil cases, victims can now sue abusers, or the institutions that enabled them, until they are 55.
The bill also opened a one-year "look-back window" during which victims can pursue civil cases, no matter how long ago the abuse took place.
Victims and their lawyers say that the Boy Scout files, which are kept at the Scouts' national office in Texas, hid the problem and left young scouts at risk.
For several years in the early 2000s, the Boy Scouts fought the release of some of the files in the case in Oregon, where in 2010 a jury found the Scouts liable for $ 18.5 million in punitive damages. That award came in a case brought by a former scout who was sexually abused at age 12 by an assistant troop leader; it was by far the largest ever against the Scouts in a jury trial.
The judge allowed only the judge and lawyers to see some of the files during the trial, but in 2012, the Oregon Supreme Court ordered the records made public. A New York Times article said the files contained accusations against 1,247 scout leaders between 1965 and 1985.
The release of those files came 10 years after a former Boy Scout troop leader in New York pleaded guilty to multiple counts of sodomy. The man, Jerrold Schwartz, acknowledged that he had molested a boy in his troop on a regular basis. He was sentenced to up to eight years in prison; he was released in 2008 after serving five years and four months.

Our View: Militias, human suffering and a troublesome border

Texto completo: The reality of illegal crossings on our southern border with Mexico has long been a fact of life. But in recent years, illegal crossings had plummeted -- by 2017, in fact, border-crossing apprehensions were at the lowest level since 1971.
That's why President Donald Trump's solution -- building a border wall to stop hordes of undocumented immigrants that were not crossing -- made no logical sense. Even his own party did not support it, failing to appropriate funds.
Once Democrats took the House majority in 2018, funds for the wall were not going to be appropriated at the levels Trump wanted. When the president unilaterally declared an emergency on the border as a way to divert funds Congress had allocated for other purposes, we and many others cried foul.
The Constitution clearly gives the power of the purse to Congress; for Trump to usurp that authority is unconstitutional.
None of that, however, is to ignore what is a growing humanitarian crisis on the border, fueled in part by Trump policies, cynically put in place to gain support for the border wall.
The country needs short-term solutions -- including assistance to cities and states that are welcoming migrants, money for more immigration judges to process claims and additional shelters on the border so people can be humanely housed. There are long-term strategies, too, including assisting the countries of origin so people choose to stay home rather than migrate to the U.S. We need to reform our asylum process and improve the immigration system, tasks this nation has put off for too long.
Rather than taking sensible steps, however, Trump has declared he will cut off aid for Central American countries and has threatened to shut the border with Mexico altogether. This is hardly a strategy, and a self-inflicted crisis is not the same as a national emergency.
Why is this crisis self-inflicted? Because the Trump administration's handling of asylum-seekers has worsened the situation. For example, the administration requires asylum-seekers to apply only at legal points of entry, then lets only a few people in at a time, causing long lines and waits. Eventually, refugees go elsewhere and illegally cross.
Now, border states such as New Mexico are dealing with the fallout, including the most recent turn of events -- self-professed, armed gangs calling themselves "militias" and preying upon migrants with threats and weapons, then handing them over to the Border Patrol.
Over the weekend, the FBI arrested a suspected leader of one of the right-wing gangs -- the so-called United Constitutional Patriots -- but not because of his actions against asylum-seekers. No, New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas said in a release that Larry Mitchell Hopkins was arrested on charges of firearms possession by a felon. (The New York Times also has revealed Hopkins' group was investigated for allegedly training to kill President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.)
While we are grateful that at least one vigilante is behind bars, we trust federal and state authorities are researching other charges to hold against them. The term "militia" should not allow gun-toters the right to hold asylum-seekers -- seeking asylum is legal, by the way -- at gunpoint. Other descriptions of what occurred are kidnapping or assault with a deadly weapon.
On Twitter, Southern New Mexico state Sen. Joseph Cervantes said it best: "NM Attny Gen. must arrest, charge and prosecute those kidnapping and pulling guns on immigrants in my Senate District/Sunland Park. Scolding them won't cut it."
That is exactly right. New Mexico's elected officials need to demand that armed gangs stop taking the law into their own hands. Citizens, migrants and others are less safe when civilians with guns are roaming loose. As
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in her reaction on Twitter: "Menacing or threatening migrant families and asylum-seekers is absolutely unacceptable and must cease."
With border apprehensions at their highest totals in
15 years, Trump may get the emergency he so desperately wanted. More refugees are coming. Now, the country needs leadership that understands how to relieve conditions on the ground and in the countries where migrations begin. Unsurprisingly, a wall is still not the solution.

New Jersey governor wants to increase price for buying and carrying a gun by 2,000%

Texto completo: New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy, a Democrat, wants to dramatically increase the permits and licenses needed to buy and carry a firearm in his state.

The New York Times reports it costs $5 to get a firearm identification card, $2 for the permit to own a firearm, and $20 for the permit to carry.

Under Murphy's budget proposal, the firearm identification card will jump from $5 to $100, the owner’s permit will go up from $2 to $40, and the permit to carry, the largest increase, will go from $20 to $400. For all three licenses and permits, the price would increase by 2,000%.

“There’s no war on responsible gun owners,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview. “We can support the efforts of the attorney general, state troopers, county and local law enforcement, to do the stuff we need to do: track crime, track gun violence, combat trafficking of illegal guns," he told the Times.

"I was in Jersey City,” he said. “It’s at least $10 to get a dog license in Jersey City. It’s still $2 to get a permit to purchase a firearm in New Jersey," he added. He also wants a "ammunition excise tax of 10% and a firearms excise tax of 2.5%."

The governor's proposal will further increase retail gun dealer licenses from $50 to $500, NJ.com reported in March.

“This is clear bullying of law-abiding gun owners in the state,” Cody McLaughlin, spokesman for the New Jersey Outdoor Alliance, told the Times. “You’re talking about sportsmen that are already paying hundreds of dollars a year in license fees.”

Murphy campaigned on implementing more gun control in a state that already have strict gun laws. According to his campaign website, Murphy proposed: "Tax gun sales to prevent violence" and mandating gun safety training.

In the state, there is already an "assault firearms" ban, a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, and carry permits are "may issue," which means local authorities may require citizens to meet certain criteria.

Texto completo: Una joven de una aldea en Guinea llegó sola de niña a Southlake (Texas) a principios de 2000. Pero en vez del sueño estadounidense, lo que se encontró fue con un hogar abusivo.
La pareja de Texas que coordinó su traslado fue declarada culpable de obligarla a trabajo forzado por 16 años y de conspirar para dar refugio a un extranjero, informó el Departamento de Justicia en un comunicado emitido el lunes.
Mohamed Toure, de 58 años, y Denise Cros-Toure, también de 58 años, deben pasar cada uno siete años tras las rejas y pagar casi 300,000 dólares en restitución . Ambos son ciudadanos de Guinea y residentes legales permanentes en EEUU . Ahora podrían perder su estatus y ser deportados al país africano, dijo el departamento.
“Espero que la sentencia de hoy aporte un poco de justicia y sanidad a la víctima, que sufrió un trauma incalculable como resultado de los crímenes atroces de los acusados”, dijo en un comunicado el subsecretario de Justicia, Eric Dreiband, de la división de Derechos Civiles del departamento. “Los acusados ​​robaron su infancia y su trabajo durante años, enriqueciéndose y dejándola con dolor y un futuro incierto”.
Según el departamento, los acusados forman parte de “adineradas y poderosas familias en Guinea”. Coordinaron para que la joven viajara sola desde el Oeste de Africa a su casa de Texas, donde s e le obligó a cocinar, limpiar, y cuidar de los hijos biológicos de la pareja.
Touré es hijo del primer presidente de Guinea, Ahmed Sékou Touré, que lideró el país africano por más de 20 años, según el diario New York Times.
Las autoridades dicen que la joven fue física, psicológica y verbalmente abusada cuando no cumplía con las órdenes cuando querían.
La niña, dicen las autoridades, fue golpeada en varias ocasiones, a veces con un cable de electricidad. También reportan que se le insultaba y le decían “esclava”, “perro” o “sin valor”. Se le obligó dormir en un parque cercano a la residencia, le afeitaron la cabeza y la bañaban con una manguera en el jardín como castigo. Agregan que no acudió a la escuela, aunque los hijos de la pareja si asistieron a la preparatoria y la universidad.
“La sentencia de hoy envía un fuerte mensaje a las personas que abusan y explotan: usted será responsable de sus actos viciosos” , dijo Jeffrey McGallicher, agente especial a cargo de la oficina del De Seguridad Diplomática en Houston.
Un vecino alentó a la joven a recolectar evidencia en agosto de 2016, según el Times. Luego decidió huir de la casa con una maleta y un bulto y fue llevada a un centro de servicios sociales.
Scott Palmer, abogado de la pareja rechazó las declaraciones , diciendo que la niña era tratada como un miembro más de la familia, reporta NBC 5.
Según Palmer, la joven era una pariente lejanda que fue enviada por su padre a crecer junto a los otros tres hijos del matrimonio Touré. Palmer dice que esa práctica es común en Africa, cuando una familia de recursos limitos envía a su niño a vivir con una familia adinerada.
“Tenía sus deberes, pero todos los niños tenían deberes”, dijo el abogado. Palmer confirmó que la niña no acudió a la escuela porque presuntamente se había quedado más tiempo en EEUU de lo que permitía su visa y temían que fuera deportada.

Texto completo: Among the many interesting words in the 448-page Mueller report were those quoting an email from Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's closest aide, in response to associates who arranged Carter Page's speaking invitation in St. Petersburg in July 2016.
Mr. Peskov wrote, "I have read about [Page]. Specialists say that he is far from being the main one. So I better not initiate a meeting in the Kremlin."
So much (again) for the idea that the insubstantial Mr. Page was collusion's Mr. Big. Washington's intelligence and law-enforcement bureaucracy knows a great deal more about things that have been central bones of contention in our national political life than the American people have been allowed to know. In what I hope will be the first of many, a New York Times story last weekend finally described—two years late—the FBI's suspicion that the Steele Dossier was influenced by Kremlin disinformation.
Likewise a few hundred officials with security clearances know the truth behind FBI Director James Comey's serial interventions in the Hillary Clinton email case—interventions that began, we learned only belatedly from press leaks, with some kind of intercepted Russian intelligence that someone placed in Mr. Comey's hands.
The questions raised by these episodes are monumental and will outlast the war over whether Mr. Trump is a nice man or not. Did Mr. Comey and his colleagues turn us into Russia, where the siloviki (veterans of the intelligence services) secretly and incompetently pull the strings of domestic politics?
Not satisfied to pick at his many deficiencies or oppose him in normal fashion, Mr. Trump's enemies promoted one of the biggest lies in U.S. history. Two years later, we are back to square one with a difference: Now much of America rightly thinks his media and partisan enemies are every bit as sleazy as Mr. Trump was said to be. In regard to personal ethics, his biggest vulnerability, millions now see even less of a difference between Mr. Trump and his opponents than they did in 2016.
When these Americans hear certain Democrats chanting "Impeach Trump now," they hear the mumbled corollary "before the American people can re-elect him."
He came to the presidency the best known and most perfectly understood candidate in history. Fifteen years before he tossed his hat in the ring, "The Simpsons" could deliver a two-word joke that needed no setup: "President Trump."
I mention this not to demean the president. The idea that his arrival somehow sullied the culture of Washington not only is absurdly overstated, it licensed the mood of conspiracy against him. He is not even the sketchiest person to hold the office in my lifetime. "There was no trusting anything he said or did on a given day," writes the historian Robert Dallek—in his book about Lyndon Johnson.
Mr. Trump is simply the sketchiest that voters ever knowingly, deliberately, with clear eyes-full hearts, elected.
He could help himself even now by conducting his presidency differently. If his approval rating were even 50%, many fewer Democrats would find it in their electoral interest to endorse unsubstantiated slanders against him.
Still, a couple of things are true. People who are innocent tend to protest their innocence. A president who sees law enforcement itself peddling fabricated evidence can be forgiven for wondering if the law has been corrupted.
As Mr. Trump's lawyer told Bob Mueller and Mr. Mueller reportedly accepted in good spirit, a president is obliged to fight back against politically motivated attacks. And for all his warts, Mr. Trump fought back more transparently than any past president would have or would have been able to, mostly on Twitter, in his own voice, taking ownership of each claim made in his defense.
The truth is, Mr. Trump is hardly capable of lying with the consistency of purpose that John Brennan and James Clapper have lied and likely will continue to lie. His White House was destined to be chaotic but how many presidents would not be thrown off balance by former high-ranking intelligence officials going on cable TV and calling them traitors?
If Mr. Trump's historically assigned task was to expose Washington's media and leadership class, with Robert Mueller's help he has succeeded. Nobody (including me) would have guessed how much our intelligence sector had come to regard itself as the guardian of a particular class's right to rule, or see its job as punishing voters when they vote wrong.
I say the following without prejudice to the real Pete Buttigieg, whom I haven't studied and who may turn out to be just another unappetizing politician. If I were a screenwriter, a gay mayor from South Bend, Ind., is exactly the character I'd invent to step over the wreckage created by Mr. Trump and his enemies and restore sanity to the American experiment.

The Most Telling Impeachment Poll; Among 2020 presidential candidates, only Trump and Warren seem eager to talk about it.

Texto completo: When asked by a reporter at the White House on Monday if he's worried about impeachment, President Donald Trump responded, "Not even a little bit." Most Democrats running for President don't seem to think he should be worried, either. In fact they don't even want to talk about it.
The reaction of this particular cohort of Democrats is interesting because after Donald Trump and his team, they are the people with the most at stake in the issue this year. Eventually one will earn the right to face Mr. Trump in the 2020 general election but right now they are vying for Democratic votes and donations.
Unlike Mr. Trump's principal House inquisitors who occupy safe seats and whose only genuine political risk is attracting a primary challenge for insufficiently "resisting" the President, the presidential candidates need to build national coalitions. And with one notable exception they are generally signalling that the Mueller report failed to deliver an obstruction case against the President.
Mr. Trump for his part seems happy to address the issue. Yesterday he tweeted:
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Then this morning, Mr. Trump took to his favorite social media platform again to say:
Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can't impeach. It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President! Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!
His potential 2020 rivals, meanwhile, aren't necessarily warming to the topic. Joshua Jamerson and Ken Thomas write in the Journal that a number of candidates have been cautious in addressing the issue and add:
Asked if impeachment should be on the table at this point, Mr. Booker of New Jersey told reporters: "No." Like other candidates skeptical of impeachment, Mr. Booker, who spent several days in the early-voting state of Nevada after the report dropped, called on [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller to testify and for congressional probes to continue.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California called for the same in an appearance in South Carolina over the weekend.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce his candidacy for President this week, has certainly had time to become familiar with Mr. Mueller's findings. Not only has he not embraced the impeachment idea. Mr. Biden hasn't commented at all.
The reporting from Messrs. Jamerson and Thomas suggests that most voters aren't looking for commentary on the topic:
"I've only been asked four questions about the Mueller report and I've been asked over 100 questions about health care," Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in New Hampshire on Friday.
Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin of the New York Times find a similar story and note an exception to the general reluctance to address the issue:
Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has worked for months to find traction in a crowded Democratic presidential primary, stepped forward on Friday with a call to arms: President Trump must be impeached.
What followed, generally, was conspicuous silence — and not just from her colleagues in Congress.
After sidestepping the explosive issue of impeachment for months by citing the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, most of the other 17 Democratic presidential candidates have responded to the special counsel's report with tentative remarks about impeaching Mr. Trump, demands for the unredacted Mueller findings, calls for further hearings or attempts to simply change the subject.
Now this is odd. News consumers have been repeatedly instructed by much of the media that it's an appalling offense for the President to threaten to fire people who work for him. Yet neither Democratic voters nor Democratic presidential candidates seem to have much interest in the topic. What kind of a scandal is it when the subject of the scandal wants to address the issue but his leading political rivals don't?
As mentioned, there is that one notable exception. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has decided to back impeachment after working "for months to find traction" in the crowded field. Two polls out today underline her campaign's urgent need for traction.
The latest University of New Hampshire Granite State poll finds that when likely Democratic voters in the state are asked an open-ended question about whom they will vote for in the 2020 primary, 40% can not name a candidate. The winner of the 2016 primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is the choice of 18% of respondents, Mr. Biden is the choice of 12%, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives 11%, Sen. Kamala Harris of California enjoys 4% support, and Sen. Warren from neighboring Massachusetts is tied with two other candidates at 3%.
When given a list of the major declared candidates, here's how likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters express their preferences:
Sanders 30%
Biden 18%
Buttigieg 15%
Warren 5%
In February of 2018, the same poll had Sen. Warren at 15%.
Meanwhile a new Gravis Marketing poll of registered Iowa Democratic voters breaks down this way:
Sanders 19%
Biden 19%
Uncertain 16%
Buttigieg 14%
Harris 6%
Warren 6%
It makes sense that Sen. Warren is now especially eager to chart a different course than her rivals for the nomination.
As for Mr. Trump, perhaps he is hoping that an impeachment effort in the House would allow him to essentially run against an institution certain to be less popular than the eventual Democratic nominee for President. The latest RealClearPolitics polling average pegs the approval rating of Congress at -43.

AJC THINGS TO DO CYCLORAMA: 5 things to know about the Cyclorama reopening: Restored painting encourages visitors to think about the 'big picture.'

Texto completo: After years of being moved, damaged, sold and altered to reflect different agendas, The Battle of Atlanta Cyclorama painting has a new home in the Atlanta History Center.
The huge circular work has been restored so visitors can see the artifact as it was meant to be viewed, and the exhibit encourages visitors to think about the "big picture" of cultural context, myth, memory and more.
If you'd like to check out the Cyclorama reopening, here are five things you need to know.
When can you go?
Buying tickets in advance is recommended, since you'll hear and see a timed audio-visual presentation, and the viewing platform accommodates a limited number of guests at one time. You'll need to select a date and time to attend, with the first show starting at 10:30 a.m. each day and the last starting at 4:30 p.m. on weekdays and 5 p.m. on weekends.
You can also try to get a walk-up ticket starting at 10 a.m. each day. About 100 walk-up tickets are available daily, but be prepared for the fact that if you get a ticket, you may be scheduled for a viewing time later in the day.
What if you miss your scheduled time?
You should arrive 30 minutes before your ticketed entry time and get in line for the exhibit 15 minutes before your entry time. If you get there more than 10 minutes after your scheduled entry time, you won't be guaranteed admission to the Cyclorama, and you won't get a refund.
How much do tickets cost?
Tickets cost $21.50 for adults, $18 for seniors 65 and up and students age 13 and up and $9 for youth age 4 to 12. Children age 3 and under are free. There's also a $3 processing fee charged with each advance ticket.
With your ticket, you'll be able to see the "Cyclorama: The Big Picture" exhibit as well as the rest of the Atlanta History Center, including its gardens. You can also use your ticket to see the Margaret Mitchell House within nine days of your Atlanta History Center visit.
What will you see? The 132-year-old Cyclorama is a cylindrical painting that's longer than a football field and stands 49 feet high. It's hung so that it creates a 3D effect, with the surface swelling toward the viewer at the horizon line and receding at the top and bottom.
The painting depicts a pivotal part of the history of Atlanta as well as that of the country - the Battle of Atlanta, which took place in 1864. About 3,000 soldiers are painted as being engaged in the battle, with an equal number in the background. It was painted to celebrate the Union victory, which was a turning point in the war.
When you see the Cyclorama, you'll listen to a 12-minute presentation and then be able to look and move about the perimeter of the viewing platform, taking time to notice its details.
What are people saying about the reopening of the Cyclorama?
The Cyclorama has received national media attention with articles about its reopening featured on websites for The New York Times and The Washington Post, among others. The Times praised the Atlanta History Center's presentation of the Cyclorama and the way it's documented, interpreted and explained. It cites "myth-puncturing wall texts on the causes and effects of the Civil War and the propaganda it produced, and in a short video projected onto the painting's surface, insists on the need for vigilance in separating history from fiction."
The Washington Post interviewed Calinda Lee, the Atlanta History Center's vice president of historical interpretation and community partnerships. It described how she " helped craft the fuller story of the way painters, promoters and politicians had continually reshaped history on the canvas." The Post cites the multi-voiced 12-minute film and mentions that visitors learn how
African-Americans were "erased from the story of the battle."

Texto completo: It appears that we are back to start on Georgia's expansion of the ACA (Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare). We have a new governor; thankfully one that's at least a bit more pragmatic regarding coverage. But we still have a confused President who as usual has no idea at all what national health care reform should look like and no plan to achieve any measurable goals.
President Trump stated time and again that we would all have "great" health care, and at a reduced cost. But he just hasn't figured out what kind of a miracle obtaining that would take for common folks, like Georgians who aren't NYC billionaires.
Meanwhile, Trump has forced the Justice Department to refuse to defend the entire ACA, something even conservative Attorney General William Barr appears to be resisting. Of course, if Obamacare departs, say hello to getting booted off policies due to pre-existing conditions. Tell your 23-yearold kid who just got out of college with a sociology degree and severe asthma who happens to be on your insurance to ASAP quit his job as a waiter and find something, anything, that provides health insurance coverage. Hard-hats and lower-middle-class white-collar workers, forget those large subsidies that are now making your premiums affordable.
Just trust that Trump will take care of the problem in 2020 after you elect him. He has publicly promised it to you. That's right, just like he did in 2015. The problems with the ACA are obvious. Before it was ever implemented, I identified and commented on those problems in this newspaper, as well as The Washington Post, USA Today, The New York Times and elsewhere. But, until we are willing to go to a Canadian or European model (like Medicare for All), we have got to live with both Obamacare's strengths and weaknesses.
I understand why taxpayers are frustrated. As I wrote in the NYT, "Americans are generally fed up with what they see as government incompetence and lying." However, the clear, undisputed-by-experts facts show that the ACA is a world better for the working poor and medically needy than what we had before. That's why over half of Americans now support it. And, it is very doubtful that even this far-right U.S. Supreme Court will find it unconstitutional, given Justice John Roberts' prior views.
Which brings us to Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia. Kemp ran as a Trumper. However, the question still remains as to does he want to help the state's citizens, or just help himself politically? The jury is out, but the ACA waiver will be a key test.
The central question before us is: will the Medicaid waiver the governor applied for make it easier for more medically needy Georgians to get health care insurance? Will there be excessive premiums and co-pays? Will the waiver be designed to help people to sign up or hinder them via excessive paperwork?
In short, will the number of uninsured here (currently ranked No. 4 in the U.S.) go down significantly? If so, the governor can chalk up a gold star and count on bipartisan votes in the next election.
The ACA is supported by the majority of Americans and expansion (90% paid for by federal dollars) has been approved in 36 states, many red. Why are we continuing to send our federal tax money to California and New York when we have unserved Georgians at home?
What can Georgians do to encourage Gov. Kemp to expand Medicaid as widely as possible here? Respond to the state of Georgia's requests for comments. Ask that the state take a reasonable, bipartisan approach. Email and call the governor's office, as well as your state representative and senator, expressing support for expansion.
Jack Bernard, the first director of health planning for Georgia, has been an executive with several national health care firms.A Republican, he's a former chairman of the Jasper County Commission.

Texto completo: Des Plaines, IL—The Des Plaines History Center is proud to announce their next Coffee Talk speaker, Dr. Emilie Le Beau Lucchesi. She will address the History Center during National Nurses Week on Thursday, May 9 at 1:30pm. She will present the subject of her nonfiction book: "This is Really War: The Incredible True Story of a Navy Nurse POW in the Occupied Philippines." Dr. Lucchesi will recount the experiences of Dorothy Still and her fellow Navy nurses, collectively known as The Twelve Anchors, who provided healthcare in the occupied Philippines during World War II. According to Dr. Lucchesi: "Dorothy Still and the Twelve Anchors were incredibly resilient, strong, and selfless women. These women were humanity at its best. They maintained rank and nursed for more than three years in a civilian concentration camp, even though they were not required to do so. By liberation, these women weighed less than 100 pounds and all had their own ailments. They would stumble when walking through the infirmary and then try to joke about it for their patients’ sake." All are invited to come learn more about the positive and powerful legacy of Nurse Dorothy Still and the Twelve Anchors. Dr. Lucchesi is a historian and prolific contributor to publications such as the "Chicago Tribune", "Los Angeles Times," and "New York Times."
Attendance is free due to the generosity of Village Bank & Trust. $3.00 suggested donations are welcome. The History Center’s Coffee Talk series began in the winter of 2003. It is an adult program meant to invite public participation and discussion on a broad range of historical topics per the History Center’s mission. The next Coffee Talk will feature Des Plaines History Center Curator of Collections Siobhan Heraty discussing: "Des Plaines Park District 100th Anniversary" on Thursday, June 13 at 1:30pm.

Texto completo: The Pulitzer Prize Board awarded a special citation Monday to the staff of the Capital Gazette for their work in covering the June attack on their Annapolis offices that killed five employees.
The Capital's citation was given "for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief." The award comes with a $100,000 bequest by the Pulitzer Board - the largest amount ever awarded - to be used to further the newspaper's journalistic mission.
The Capital Gazette staff was also a Pulitzer finalist in the editorial writing category.
In the face of tragedy, the Capital Gazette staffers continued to report on the shooting June 28 that killed Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters.
The Pulitzer Prize Board's special citation for the Capital was an unusual decision, existing outside of the 21 categories across journalism, books, drama and music awarded annually. A special citation was last awarded in 2011 to songwriter Hank Williams. The previous record for a cash award was $15,000, said Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy.
Canedy called the prize money a statement of support for local news, and said she hopes the gesture brings a measure of comfort to the staff and their families.
"It was important to us to make the contribution significant enough to aid the newspaper in continuing to do extraordinary community work," Canedy said.
Leadership with Baltimore Sun Media, which includes the Capital Gazette, will work with the newspaper's staff to determine how best to use the funds from the Pulitzer Board, said Tim Knight, CEO of the group's parent company Tribune Publishing, in an email Monday to employees.
"I ask that we pause and consider the remarkable sacrifice and dedication that our journalists poured into their award-winning work," Knight said. "That ... our teams could deliver such precise, compelling, heartbreaking journalism while their own hearts were breaking demands our awe."
Capital editor Rick Hutzell called the citation a "great honor," but one that brought mixed emotions.
"We spent the last couple of weeks talking about what this could mean," Hutzell said of the Pulitzer Board's consideration. "It's a recognition of what happened after June 28. The work we've done in the last eight to nine months speaks volumes about the community of journalism and it speaks worlds about the people in this room."
Staff believe it is the first Pulitzer that the paper has won.
Staffers gathered in the newsroom for a small event that Hutzell said was not quite a celebration.
"We weren't sure what to call this today," he said. "We have some refreshments in the office. We didn't want to have a celebration, but it feels really good that our peers were nationally recognized."
Reporter Chase Cook said the mood among the staffers, former colleagues and family at the gathering Monday was "subdued."
"There was definitely no exciting pop-off like there may have been at other papers," Cook said. "It was a little confused. Was it OK to cheer? It's a complicated feeling. I think we were all overcome with excitement, but also the reminder of the worst day of our lives."
Despite the bittersweet feelings, reporter Selene San Felice said she felt elated to learn of the special citation. "[I want people] to know that we do this not for us, but for the community," San Felice said. "We picked up nationwide notoriety after the shooting, but we're reporting for Anne Arundel County, for Annapolis. That's been our goal since day one and nobody's going to stop that."
Trif Alatzas, publisher and editor-in-chief of Baltimore Sun Media, which includes the Capital Gazette, called the award a great tribute to the staff's work under extraordinary circumstances.
"They always came to work and did their job as they remembered Rob Hiaasen, Rebecca Smith, Wendi Winters, John McNamara and Gerald Fischman," Alatzas said. "We also owe an incredible amount of thanks to the entire journalism community, who provided so much assistance throughout the days, weeks and months to help this organization continue on its mission."
Before announcing the winners, Canedy shared strong words recognizing journalists, including those at the Capital Gazette, who have died for their work.
Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted a congratulations to the Capital Gazette and called the prize a "well-deserved honor."
"Gerald, Rob, John, Rebecca, and Wendi will never be forgotten," Hogan said in the tweet.
The 2019 winners and finalists of the Pulitzer Prize, considered one of the highest honors in journalism, were announced Monday afternoon at Columbia University's School of Journalism. Other winners included: the South Florida Sun Sentinel (also part of Tribune Publishing) for its coverage of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland; the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for coverage of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting; and The New York Times for its investigation into President Donald Trump's finances.
Aretha Franklin, who died last summer, also received a special citation from the Pulitzer Prize board, with judges praising the Queen of Soul "for her indelible contribution to American music and culture."
In addition to the Pulitzer citation, the Capital staffers won the 2019 News Leaders Association award for breaking news and were named among Time magazine's Person of the Year for their work as "The Guardians and the War on Truth." And Hutzell accepted the National Press Foundation's Benjamin C. Bradlee Editor of the Year award in February.
The Maryland General Assembly unanimously voted in March to designate June 28 as "Freedom of the Press Day" to honor the fallen Capital employees.

Make New York Grow Again; Amid a population bust, Mayor de Blasio wants to deny our fair share of asylum seekers.

Texto completo: On Wednesday this column noted the interesting coincidence that lightly taxed Nashville has been enjoying a population boom. Meanwhile readers will never guess what's been happening lately in the heavily taxed city where the mayor views property rights as a barrier to progress.
The Journal's Joseph De Avila reports that New York City lost population in each of the last two years, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released on Thursday. Mr. De Avila writes:
New York's population dropped 0.47% to 8.4 million by July 2018, compared with the previous year. Census officials previously estimated that New York's population grew by about 7,000 in 2017, but revised figures show it actually dipped by about 38,000, a 0.45% decline from the prior year.
... Net migration, the sum of all people moving in and out of the city, has also decreased in recent years. In 2011, that number increased by about 14,300, a reversal of a decadeslong downward trend. That number began to fall again in 2013 and shrank by about 87,000 in 2018, as the city reverted back to its previous trend, city planning officials said.
In another interesting coincidence, 2013 was the year Mr. de Blasio was first elected mayor. The trend is disturbing. As if the burden of New York City governance isn't driving enough people away, Mr. de Blasio has effectively been building a wall against new residents, and we're all going to pay for it.
Recently, Mr. de Blasio helped persuade Amazon not to build a new headquarters in New York City by promising, among other things, to pressure the company to unionize their workforce. Now, he's threatening court action if President Trump decides to transport people apprehended at the U.S. southern border to Gotham.
The President has recently floated the idea of moving people caught crossing the border illegally—and who cannot be held while their immigration cases await resolution in the courts—to "sanctuary" jurisdictions. Such locales, including New York City, attempt to signal their virtue by refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement officials.
But Mr. de Blasio seems to have decided that signalling his virtuous defiance of Mr. Trump is more important than signalling a virtuous embrace of immigrants. When asked about the Trump proposal, which could enable New York City to provide sanctuary to a significantly larger number of illegal migrants, Mr. de Blasio did not send a welcoming signal. "It's illegal," the mayor said on local cable channel NY1. Mr. de Blasio then promised to defeat the President on the legal merits: "We'll meet him in court. We'll beat him in court...We'll stop it."
Perhaps New Yorkers should be gratified about the mayor's seeming new respect for the rule of law but it's hard to square with his previously stated determination to help illegal immigrants avoid federal capture. In January of 2018, Mr. de Blasio was among a group of mayors who cited the issue as their reason for boycotting a meeting with President Trump. The New York Times reported :
As Mr. Trump was set to meet with the mayors who did not cancel, Mr. de Blasio stood in the Capital Hilton and pointedly challenged the White House response, issued through [Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders], that the mayors who canceled should take up their complaints with Congress.
''They're simply trying to demonize immigrants as part of their current congressional strategy,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''That's what that says to me, if that's the game they're playing.''
Now Mr. de Blasio's game is to block illegal migrants from coming to New York City.
To summarize, after chasing away the highly-educated, highly-skilled Amazonians, Mr. de Blasio is now promising to block the arrival of migrants with little education and few skills. Are there any new neighbors he's willing to accept?
New York could use some. Based on today's Census report, our community needs another 40,000 migrants each year just to keep population level, never mind healthy growth. To make New York grow again, the mayor could start by volunteering to take all of the 53,000 families apprehended on the southwest border last month. If he cares about a thriving New York and second chances for illegal border crossers, surely Mr. de Blasio can negotiate a legal welcome.

Mueller Report Reveals Extent of Trump's Involvement in Russia Tower Plans; In talks with his former lawyer Michael Cohen, president 'suggested that his campaign would be a significant "infomercial" for Trump-branded properties'

Texto completo: The special counsel's report reveals new details about President Trump's conversations with his former lawyer Michael Cohen during the 2016 campaign about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, including Mr. Trump's repeated inquiries that spring about the project's status.
Mr. Cohen has publicly testified the efforts were far more extensive than the president has publicly indicated and than Mr. Cohen himself described in 2017 congressional testimony.

Mr. Cohen—who last year pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in 2017 when he said the project negotiations had ended in January 2016, before the Iowa caucus—told federal prosecutors that Mr. Trump asked him in March or April 2016 "if anything was happening in Russia," according to the report. Mr. Cohen also recalled briefing Donald Trump Jr. that spring.
Mr. Trump said he would be willing to travel to Russia during the campaign if Mr. Cohen could "lock and load" on the deal, Mr. Cohen told prosecutors, according to the report released Thursday. Mr. Trump didn't ultimately travel to Russia. That summer, Mr. Trump publicly proclaimed he had "nothing to do" with Russia, but the report says Mr. Cohen told prosecutors that the candidate "shortly afterwards privately checked with Cohen" about the status of the Moscow project.
After the election, Mr. Cohen developed together with Mr. Trump talking points to "dismiss the idea of a substantial connection between Trump and Russia," Mr. Cohen told prosecutors. Mr. Cohen said those talking points included his assertion to a New York Times reporter in early 2017 that the Moscow project negotiations had ended in January 2016.
"Cohen said that he discussed the talking points with Trump but that he did not explicitly tell Trump he thought they were untrue because Trump already knew they were untrue," the report says.
Mr. Cohen also recalled conversations with Mr. Trump in which the candidate "suggested that his campaign would be a significant 'infomercial' for Trump-branded properties," though Mr. Cohen didn't recall discussing the political implications of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump, according to the report.
The report also details conversations between Mr. Cohen and lawyers for the president ahead of his 2017 congressional testimony, during a time when Mr. Cohen was part of a joint defense agreement with the president. The statement Mr. Cohen prepared for his testimony contained multiple falsehoods, including that Mr. Cohen had never received a response from the Kremlin to his outreach regarding the proposal, the report says.
Early drafts of that statement included a sentence that said: "The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian government officials." That line was deleted in the final version, a decision Mr. Cohen was told was made under the joint defense agreement, according to the Mueller report. Mr. Cohen didn't push back, it added.
Mr. Cohen also told the special counsel that he discussed with the president's lawyers that there "were more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the statement reflected." The president's lawyer, who isn't named in the report, told Mr. Cohen to keep his statement "tight" and that it wasn't necessary to include those details because the project didn't progress. Mr. Mueller said he sought to interview the president's lawyer about those conversations but the lawyer declined, citing privilege concerns.
Mr. Mueller's report also examined the president's public statements about Mr. Cohen and how they shifted from praising his then-lawyer to attacking him after Mr. Cohen publicly broke with the president. "The evidence concerning this sequence of events could support an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the provision of information or undermine Cohen's credibility once Cohen began cooperating," Mr. Mueller wrote.
The special counsel's report also offers new details about conversations regarding a pardon between Mr. Cohen and the president's lawyers. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Mr. Cohen had directed his own lawyers to seek a pardon from the president.

Mr. Cohen told prosecutors that he discussed the possibility of a pardon with a lawyer for the president, who Mr. Cohen said told him to "stay on message, that the investigation was a witch hunt, and that everything would be fine."
The report says Mr. Cohen "understood based on this conversation and previous conversations about pardons with the President's personal counsel that as long as he stayed on message, he would be taken care of by the President, either through a pardon or through the investigation being shut down." Mr. Cohen broke with the president in July.
The report makes no mention of a conversation between Mr. Cohen and the president himself regarding a pardon, which Mr. Trump asserted happened in a recent tweet. In the tweet, Mr. Trump said he declined Mr. Cohen's request for a pardon. Mr. Cohen has denied that such a conversation with President Trump occurred.

Texto completo: On Jan. 10, 2017, a news-and-entertainment website called BuzzFeed published the text of the Steele dossier. Simultaneously, most of the U.S. media began running stories based on anonymous intelligence sources suggesting the possibility of a link during the previous year's election between U.S. President-elect Trump and Vladimir Putin. This came to be known as "the Russian collusion narrative." The Steele dossier was the narrative's Rosetta Stone, the reason to believe all the other stories might be true.
On page 9 of the Steele dossier -- if you've never read it, now's the time -- the following statement appears:
"Speaking separately, also in July 2016, an official close to Presidential Administration Head, S. IVANOV, confided in a compatriot that a senior colleague in the Internal Political Department of the PA, DIVYEKIN (nfd) also had met secretly with PAGE on his recent visit. Their agenda had included DIVEYKIN raising a dossier of 'kompromat' the Kremlin possessed. . ."
All 35 pages of the Steele dossier read that way. It is almost perfectly analogous to the children's party game of telephone, when an adult whispers something into a 5-year-old's ear and it is passed on silently to seven other children, who all laugh at the discrepancy between what went in and what came out.
But the American people aren't laughing. A children's telephone game of whispered half-facts played by elites at the highest level of America's institutions is why the U.S. political system has been in hell from 2017 until the release of the Mueller report.
How this hell got started was predictable. Days before his inauguration, the 45th U.S. president, personally offended by his media coverage, started calling the press "fake news."
A famous saying in American politics is, "Never argue with a man who buys ink by the barrel." Politicians and the press have always understood this modus vivendi, which resembles the civilizing, unwritten rules of life in the mafia.
When someone recently gunned down a crime boss on Staten Island in what looked like a classic mob hit, the first thing the cops noted was that the killer had broken the rule that you never shoot a guy in front of his own house.
With the Trump-is-Putin's-stooge narrative, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC began writing their own rules. Hitting Mr. Trump with the collusion stories in early 2017 was one thing. He hit them with "fake news," so they hit back. Politics ain't patty cake.
But past some point, the battle between Mr. Trump and his opposition turned into something not seen before in American political life. Many of the country's primary institutions arrayed themselves against an elected U.S. president, who they said, explicitly and constantly, was a mortal threat to "democracy."
These institutions -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence services, the press, members of Congress and cultural elites -- believed or talked themselves into believing that taking down Donald Trump would be worth whatever damage this effort was doing to at least half the population's faith in them.
It was not worth it. And now the country is left with the collusion narrative's rubble.
The Trump chase has changed the standards of American reporting forever. Asking the public to lend credibility to nameless sources, once rare, has become normal, as in, "requested anonymity in order to speak freely." Routine guessing or insinuation has equal weight in stories with finding facts, as in: "It is unclear what this may mean." Indeed.
No surprise, the Democrats' ardent defense of the special prosecutor's independence is now seen as bad faith. They didn't care about transparency. They wanted a result. As soon as Attorney General William Barr released his letter summarizing the Mueller report, their own narrative shifted from collusion to "coverup."
Now Democratic House committees are spraying subpoenas, like the Orkin Man, into every cranny of Mr. Trump's business and financial life. Indiscriminate subpoenas are also likely to become a routine postcollusion standard in American politics.
The Trump presidency was always going to be a heavy load for the country to process without the Russia jihad. Even before the collusion narrative emerged, recall the generalized anxiety at the thought that some ruralized, lower-class version of H.L. Mencken's booboisie was taking over the country. What's worse, they won!
The Trump presidency was never a threat to democracy. It was, and remains, a daily violation of etiquette. Rather than fight Trumpism on the policy and political merits, the appalled opposition bet on the long shot of Robert Mueller proving the Oval Office violator has been in Vladimir Putin's pocket. If successful, that would have discredited whatever happened in the 2016 election. The grievances and realities revealed in the election's results would just kind of . . . go away.
Two hellish years later, and with Mr. Mueller's investigation complete, Donald Trump is still president. Democrats and the media should give the rest of us a break. Find a more civilized strategy to fight the Trump presidency. Like mafia rules.

Texto completo: Illustration The mugshot of 18-year-old Sol Pais of Florida whose threats caused hundreds of schools across Colorado to close on Wednesday. She was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound near the base of Mount Evans on Wednesday morning.

The "massive manhunt" is now over for an 18-year-old Florida woman who caused hundreds of schools in Colorado to close on Wednesday after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) considered her armed and "extremely dangerous" after it was confirmed that she made threats to the safety of students in the Denver Metro Area.

According to the Denver Post, Sol Pais was seen running naked through the woods near the base of Mount Evans shortly before she turned a gun on herself Wednesday morning.

The FBI confirmed Pais' death.

"We can confirm that Sol Pais is deceased," the Bureau tweeted on Wednesday. "We are grateful to everyone who submitted tips and to all our law enforcement partners for their efforts in keeping our community safe."

Authorities stated that it was Pais' presence that caused more than 20 schools in Jefferson County to go on lockdown on Tuesday and to close the following day.

At a news conference Tuesday night, Special Agent Dean Phillips, the man in charge of the FBI in Denver, said that his office was tipped off about the threat of Pais by the Miami FBI office. He said she flew into Denver on Monday night, bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition, and then went to the foothills of Jefferson County.

"Because of her comments and her actions, because of her travel here to the state, because of her procurement of a weapon immediately upon arriving here, we consider her to be a credible threat, certainly to the community and, potentially, to schools," Phillips said.

An FBI bulletin sent to local law enforcement agencies on Tuesday stated that Pais was "infatuated" with the Columbine High School massacre that happened 20 years ago this Saturday. Details about her infatuation with the shooting are still unknown as authorities have not yet expanded on this statement.

After Pais was still not located on Tuesday, hundreds of districts across the Denver Metro Area and beyond, including Estes Park School District, made the decision to close their schools on Wednesday.

In a letter from Denver Public Schools, District Spokesman Will Jones said superintendents from across the metro area assessed the threat and decided it was appropriate to close schools on Wednesday.

"The decision was based on information provided by law enforcement and analysis provided by threat assessment experts," Jones said.

Estes Park School District made the decision to close its schools Wednesday as a safety precaution for its students.

"Though Estes Park is not in the Metro Denver area, we made the decision to close out of an abundance of caution, and with the utmost concern for the safety and well-being of our students and staff," the school district wrote in a Facebook post.

With students going back to school tomorrow, the district said in a letter sent out to parents on Wednesday night that there will be a larger than usual law enforcement presence on campus as a furthered safety measure.

Though the threat has subsided, there will be heightened safety and security measures in place," the letter states. "You can expect to see extra law enforcement presence on campus. We do not provide all of our security details to the public but know that staff will be extra vigilant. Your children are well protected.

The New York Times reported that Pais' parents reported her missing to authorities in Florida on Monday. According to reports, she was a senior at a Miami Beach high school.

Pais' threats come just days before the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre where two students shot and killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher.

Google's disturbing case of data gathering

Texto completo: Google knows where you've been -- and with a warrant, the police can know, too. A New York Times investigation detailing how law enforcement seeks location records from the tech titan shows that the country's lack of privacy laws affects not only what companies know about us, but also what the government does, too.
Google compiles information on consumers' whereabouts in various ways. Its "Location History" service is one of the most comprehensive. The feature is enabled when users respond to prompts in the company's maps and photos apps, among others, but once it is switched on Google can gather data on signed-in devices even when those apps are not open. Though it's possible to toggle off the tracking, it is not easy -- and the manner of collection means consumers are likely unaware of the extent to which Google is following them, and why.
Large-scale location monitoring is useful to Google because it allows the company to target advertisements based on where consumers regularly travel, as well as to assess the ads' effectiveness. It is useful to law enforcement because it can allow investigators to view the movement of all devices within a specific area over a specific period of time to track down suspects or witnesses in cases that otherwise might go cold.
Google lets officials into its Sensorvault database only with a warrant. At first, the company attaches anonymous ID numbers to devices; names and email addresses enter the equation later, once detectives have picked out the devices they deem relevant to the case. But jurisdictions may differ on what constitutes probable cause for both types of request, each of which will likely sweep in innocent bystanders as well as reasonable suspects. It also appears that some judges are approving these escalating levels of access in a single warrant, trusting investigators to limit themselves when they ask for more extensive data.
The Google case raises two questions: what data a company should be able to collect, and to what extent the government should be able to access that data once it is collected. But these are impossible to separate. Courts have yet to determine what constitutional protections this type of location data deserves, and legislators haven't stepped in. So it has been up to Google to devise a system for complying with requests -- just as, in the absence of federal regulation on data privacy, it has largely been up to Google to determine the bounds of collection that let it create a such a vast repository of information in the first place.
The judiciary will have to continue playing catch-up to increasingly intrusive methods of surveillance unless legislators take the lead on limiting companies' ability to surveil. The assumption today is that Google and its peers will almost always know where everyday Americans have been, even when those Americans are not aware of it. Congress needs to ensure that customers get more of a say in the matter.

Texto completo: The Wall Street Journal won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles that detailed hush-money payments to two women who said they had affairs with President Trump.
The investigation -- which placed Mr. Trump at the center of a scheme to silence Stephanie Clifford, the former adult-film star known professionally as Stormy Daniels, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal before the 2016 presidential election -- won the Pulitzer for national reporting.
For the 103rd annual competition, the South Florida Sun Sentinel won in the public service category for "exposing failings by school and law-enforcement officials before and after the deadly shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."
In the national reporting category, a team of Journal reporters won for "uncovering President Trump's secret payoffs to two women during his campaign who claimed to have had affairs with him, and the web of supporters who facilitated the transactions, triggering criminal inquiries and calls for impeachment."
The New York Times and Washington Post each won two awards. The Times was recognized for its investigation of Mr. Trump's finances and for editorials by Brent Staples. The Post won for criticism by Carlos Lozada and for photography of the famine in Yemen.
The Associated Press and Reuters won Pulitzers for their coverage of war in Yemen and the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, respectively. Reuters also won for breaking news photography of South and Central American migrants to the U.S.
The Los Angeles Times took home the prize for investigative reporting on a former University of Southern California gynecologist accused of violating hundreds of young women. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was recognized for coverage of a deadly synagogue shooting, and the Advocate of Baton Rouge, La., won the local reporting award.

Texto completo: Pulitzer Prizes were awarded on Monday to news organizations that uncovered instances of malfeasance and outright fraud in President Trump's financial past, recognizing journalists' perseverance in the face of the president's ever-sharper attacks on a free press.
The New York Times received the explanatory reporting prize for an 18-month investigation that revealed how the future president and his relatives avoided paying roughly half a billion dollars' worth of taxes. The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting award for disclosing clandestine payoffs made by the president's associates before the 2016 election to two women who had alleged affairs with Mr. Trump.
Threats to journalists, foreign and domestic, provided a backdrop for this year's prizes, which also honored reporters forced to cover deadly tragedies in their hometowns and, in one case, their own newsroom. In the cultural realm, the Pulitzers recognized the singer Aretha Franklin for her contributions to American music, the first special citation granted to a woman.
The South Florida Sun Sentinel won the prize for public service, considered the most prestigious of the Pulitzers, for documenting the massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February. The paper's in-depth articles revealed a series of failures by local officials and law enforcement that, the paper wrote, contributed to the loss of life.
"Feeling overwhelmed and grateful," a Sun Sentinel reporter, Scott Travis, wrote on Twitter after learning of the honor. "But also sad that we won the greatest journalism award -- the Pulitzer -- because of a tragedy that never should have happened."
[Here's the full list of winners.]
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for breaking news coverage of a gunman's spree at the Tree of Life synagogue in October, where 11 people died. The Pulitzer board also recognized The Capital Gazette of Annapolis, Md., where five employees were killed in a shooting in June, with a special citation that included a $100,000 bequest. Dana Canedy, the awards' administrator, cited The Capital Gazette's "unflagging commitment to covering news at a time of unspeakable grief."
In honoring The Sun Sentinel, The Post-Gazette and The Capital Gazette, the Pulitzer board underlined the importance of local journalism at a moment when regional papers are struggling to survive. First given in 1917, the Pulitzer Prizes are presented annually by Columbia University for excellence in journalism and letters.
Invoking the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, The Washington Post columnist killed in Turkey by Saudi assassins, Ms. Canedy praised this year's honorees for a willingness to speak truth to power.
"This year's winning work reflects yet again a steely resolve in upholding the principles of this noble profession," Ms. Canedy said.
The Times's examination of Mr. Trump's family finances, by the journalists David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner, drew on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records and previously undisclosed tax returns. The award was the fourth Pulitzer win for Mr. Barstow, a record for a reporter. (The news photographer Carol Guzy, the poet Robert Frost, the playwright Eugene O'Neill and the playwright and biographer Robert Sherwood have also won four prizes.)
The Times won in the category of editorial writing, for essays by Brent Staples that grappled with questions of race, slavery, and memory in communities across the country. In accepting his award in The Times newsroom on Monday, Mr. Staples, who joined the paper's editorial board in 1990, thanked his great-great-grandmother, who was born into slavery, saying, "I was channeling my family story."
The complexities of race and class figured in many of the prizewinning works.
The award for drama went to Jackie Sibblies Drury for "Fairview," a play that challenges viewers to confront their prejudices, and which The Times critic Ben Brantley called "dazzling and ruthless."
"Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," an examination of the civil rights pioneer by David W. Blight, won the history prize, and the biography award went to Jeffrey C. Stewart for "The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke," a portrait of the Harlem Renaissance patron.
Darrin Bell, a freelancer artist, became the first African-American to win for editorial cartooning, for a series published in The Washington Post on the experiences of disenfranchised groups under the Trump administration.
It was one of three prizes awarded on Monday to The Post, including feature photography -- for Lorenzo Tugnoli's pictures of a famine in Yemen -- and criticism, for essays by the paper's nonfiction book critic, Carlos Lozada.
The ProPublica journalist Hannah Dreier received the feature writing award, for capturing the plight of Salvadoran immigrants caught in a federal crackdown on MS-13 gang members on Long Island; one of her pieces was copublished by The New York Times Magazine. The staff of Reuters won the breaking news photography prize for a visual narrative of migrants traveling toward the United States border.
The Los Angeles Times won the investigative reporting prize for revealing accusations of sexual abuse against a gynecologist at the University of Southern California. The reporting, by Matt Hamilton, Harriet Ryan and Paul Pringle, led in part to the resignation of the university's president.
Tony Messenger of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch received the commentary prize for columns about rural Missourians faced with unaffordable fines for minor offenses. The Advocate, of Baton Rouge, La., received the prize for local reporting for a critical examination of Louisiana's criminal justice system.
In the international reporting category, the year's winners included Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, Reuters journalists imprisoned for more than a year in Myanmar. Their reporting, on human rights violations against Rohingya Muslims in the Southeast Asian nation, shared the prize with coverage by The Associated Press of atrocities in Yemen.
The journalist Eliza Griswold won the nonfiction writing prize for "Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America," the story of an Appalachian family disrupted by an oil fracking company. The fiction prize went to Richard Powers for "The Overstory," a narrative that entwines the lives of humans and trees.
Ellen Reid won the music prize for her operatic work "p ris m," and the poetry prize went to Forrest Gander for "Be With," a collection of meditations on grief and loss.
At the start of Monday's ceremony, Ms. Canedy recognized an entry that had not won: 17 obituaries of slain Parkland students and faculty, written by the staff of the school's student publication, The Eagle Eye.
"These budding journalists remind us of the media's unwavering commitment to bearing witness," Ms. Canedy said, adding that the students' work "should give us all hope for the future of journalism in this great democracy."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misidentified three finalists as winners.
The Pittsburgh mass shooting at a synagogue and failings of law enforcement officials before and after the Parkland, Florida high school massacre were among the subjects that garnered newspapers the top prize in journalism Monday.
The Pittsburg Post-Gazette was awarded a Pulitzer for best Breaking News Reporting for its coverage of the mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue that resulted in 11 deaths and thrust the community into grief. The South Florida Sun Sentinel was given the best Public Service Pulitzer award for exposing failings by school and law enforcement officials before and after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
The Pulitzer Prize winners for 2019 were announced on Monday afternoon at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in New York City.

Texto completo: [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
If you think news about Facebook is crowding your feed, you are right. But that isn't new news.
As of midday Friday, The Wall Street Journal published 510 online articles with "Facebook" in the headline since the Cambridge Analytica news broke in March 2018, according to Factiva. Not surprisingly, two-thirds of those were about data. The Journal isn't alone. Over the same period, The Washington Post published 458 articles about the social-media company, compared with 427 for the New York Times.
That means each outlet has reported on the company more times than there are days in the past 13 months. Readers may still welcome articles on Facebook, but the topic has apparently exhausted the interest of investors. While news on data flubs continues to flow readily, Facebook's stock is up 37% so far this year.
Some people love to hear dirt on their friends; others ignore it.

Eyes On Assange Case

Texto completo: Some media watchdogs worried Thursday that Julian Assange’s arrest would inhibit the disclosure of government information and, therefore, diminish government accountability and erode personal privacy.
But Assange’s case is distinctly different from other cases in which whistle-blowers or leakers have released information that the government wanted to keep secret.
The federal indictment against Assange does not charge him with illegally publishing anything. Rather, it charges him with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, claiming that he conspired with convicted Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning in 2010 to steal government secrets, and hacked into government computers to steal classified information.
Generally, U.S. courts have found that journalists cannot be held liable for information that they legally obtain from others. That does not absolve them, however, of doing anything illegal to obtain the information.
In the famous Pentagon Papers case, for example, The New York Times and The Washington Post received documents from Daniel Ellsburg, who worked as a consultant for the Department of Defense. Unlike the allegation against Assange, they did not steal the information from the government.
Most important, the indictment does not charge Assange with espionage.
Unfortunately, the government’s penchant for secrecy breeds suspicion, but there is no indication that this case will chill press freedom.

Texto completo: Days before the 2018 midterm elections, President Trump said there would be an approximately 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. He went on to say the tax cut would be in place by November 2018. Heard anything about that lately? Now he says the Republicans will be putting forward a great new health care package. It is about time, as the Republicans have had years to offer a replacement for the Affordable Care Act but nothing has happened. Hopefully, it will not go the way of the president's promised tax cut for the middle class.
KEN CHRISTY, WOODSTOCK
Liberals, mainstream mediaproveTrumpright
Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on April 9 tweeted that white nationalists certainly think MAGA is a white nationalist slogan. Comedian Chelsea Handler admitted that President Trump's being elected sent her to find comfort on the psychiatrist's sofa.
Rosie O'Donnell has said President Trump will be arrested and he will never be reelected. President Trump tweeted, "The left has become totally unhinged. They no longer care what is right for our country." If one gives thought to the statements of Hillary, Chelsea, Rosie, radical members of Congress, and the reporting style of The Washington Post, New York Times and USA Today as well as their editorials and the opinions of their liberal columnists, one would agree with President Trump's tweet. The American people see the objective of the left. President Trump will be reelected, psychiatrists will make serious money, and mental wards will have patients, wall-to-wall!
BILL SMITH, STOCKBRIDGE
their physicians, and they are incapable of looking at facts and implications and making rational adult decisions. Indeed, Gov. Brian Kemp says this to his daughters as well. He is telling them they will need to look to the Legislature to make the decisions of their lives for them. I ask Gov. Kemp to tell his daughters and other women in this state they can be moral adults who can decide as autonomous human beings. Gov. Kemp can do this by not signing this heartbeat bill, which is immoral, highhanded and oppressive. This bill will not stop abortion but will make it unsafe.
BETH DANIELL, DECATUR
Gov.Kemp should ignore Hollywood loudmouths
Again, we have pompous voices from Hollywood threatening to boycott Georgia, this time due to the passage of the "Heartbeat Bill," which will ban abortion of a forming baby once a heartbeat is detected. To those opposed to abortion, this is a painful compromise. To the uncompromising radical left, nothing short of the "right" of a woman to destroy the life inside her right up until the head has crowned is acceptable. Let's turn the tables on these virtue-signaling script readers who believe their ability to act comports upon them special social understanding not held by us commoners. They want to boycott Georgia? Refuse to pay to watch anything that employs these loudmouths. Alyssa Milano is welcome to not come to Georgia for her next paycheck. There are many talented people who could replace her in a heartbeat. Gov. Brian Kemp, do right by your citizens and sign this bill.

Texto completo: Two of Facebook Inc.'s longest-serving board members will be stepping down as part of a shake-up of the company's governance.
Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles won't be standing for re-election this year, the company said Friday.
The move strips Facebook of two of its longest-serving directors without historical investment stakes or close ties to the company's leadership.
Messrs. Hastings and Bowles have served on the board since 2011. Only venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and investor Peter Thiel, two of the company's early backers, have served longer.
Peggy Alford, a senior vice president at PayPal Holdings Inc., will be joining the board as its first African-American woman. Before joining PayPal this year, Ms. Alford was chief financial officer of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropic organization of Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.
Before her work for the foundation, Ms. Alford held a number of posts at PayPal, including chief financial officer of the Americas and senior vice president of human resources.
The shuffle removes two board members well known in political circles, at a time when Facebook is under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over its approach to privacy and the policing of its platforms. Mr. Bowles, a North Carolina businessman, was White House chief of staff during the Clinton administration and a longtime figure in Washington. Mr. Hastings has been known for his support of Democratic causes and opposition to Donald Trump. During the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Hastings criticized Mr. Thiel's public support for Mr. Trump as "catastrophically bad judgment" in an email, according to the New York Times.
Mr. Hastings offered to resign after the disagreement was made public, and Mr. Zuckerberg rejected the suggestion, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Mr. Hastings's departure comes as the social-media giant has increasingly sought to establish itself as a player in video entertainment, making it more of a rival to Netflix. The prospect of conflicts of interest with more conventional entertainment companies contributed to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's departure from the board of Walt Disney Co. last year.
Mr. Bowles was a member of Facebook's audit committee, which was strengthened last year after investors pushed for its mandate to include privacy, cybersecurity and social impact. Even before the change, Mr. Bowles had stood out for his concern about the potential for Facebook to be used in foreign political interference.
In a filing alongside its shareholder proxy, Facebook stated that as a "general policy" the company doesn't renominate directors who have reached the age of 72. Mr. Bowles is 73 years old.
In a statement, Mr. Zuckerberg said of Ms. Alford: "Peggy is one of those rare people who's an expert across many different areas -- from business management to finance operations to product development. I know she will have great ideas that help us address both the opportunities and challenges facing our company."

Russiagate and the Media's News Denial

Texto completo: The most universal press bias is to exaggerate the importance of whatever is being claimed or reported. Don't underestimate the role this played in Russiagate. For CNN and MSNBC, the collusion story was a commercial godsend.
When you're not thinking with your brain, you're thinking with the brain of your milieu. Virtue signaling is almost a nondescriptive term if you ask any psychologist or, increasingly, an economist: People are intensely social animals. Everything we do is about display. This also played a role in the media freak-out over Russia.
That said, I suspect at least one major news organization in this country will soon decide it can no longer afford to be dragged against its will to acknowledge the doings of U.S. intelligence agencies in the 2016 election. It will want to get on top of the story.
To be sure, grossly illegal things were done -- such as intelligence leaks. But the real story, once it's pieced together starting with James Comey's original intervention in the Clinton email case, will be a concatenation of ill-advised, bumptious, politically loaded decisions whose consequences America hasn't owned up to yet.
A piquant moment was revealed by Fox anchor Brett Baier when he asked Mr. Comey last year if he had seen Obama intelligence chieftains John Brennan and James Clapper since leaving office. Mr. Comey at first equivocated and then quickly amended his statement to acknowledge that the three had dined together just two days earlier.
They are now in the soup together, but quite possibly in the soup because of the one Comey intervention that his colleagues didn't endorse -- his odd decision to reopen the Hillary investigation before Election Day. Pollsters tell us this single act might have elected Donald Trump.
It will be argued late into the night, but it strikes me as entirely legitimate for the FBI to be concerned about Russian trawling of minor and outre Trump associates. If the premise was the Steele dossier, though, this may be worse than embarrassing. Understand something about the Mueller investigation: It consisted largely of asking the FBI what it already knew. The U.S. government has vast intelligence resources; it's always open season on foreign nationals like Christopher Steele. So the FBI likely knew early on a great deal about the (non)credibility of his sources and claims.
Bottom line: It's plausible, perhaps even likely, that we will find our intelligence community used exceptionally flimsy intelligence to do what it wanted to do anyway in two seminal instances: the Clinton email case (about which I've written ad nauseam) and the Trump collusion investigation.
My argument for years has been that readers can repose a high degree of trust in brand-name news organizations to spell names correctly, quote sources accurately, nail down discrete facts.
You can't trust their thinking. I have 50 examples at hand but take Chuck Todd of MSNBC, who accuses William Barr of spreading a "factless conspiracy theory" because the attorney general acknowledged this week that the FBI had spied on the Trump campaign.
A synonym for spying is "foreign intelligence surveillance" -- the name of the court to which the FBI appealed four times to spy on a Trump campaign associate. This is a fact. Mr. Barr did not say such spying was unwarranted. A conspiracy theory is what MSNBC promoted on its air for two years with the Trump collusion story.
What exactly is wrong with Mr. Todd's brain? He confuses two basic categories: good/bad and true/false. He believes he's speaking in the journalistic language of true/false, but he really means: While it may be false that Trump colluded with Russia, this is a pro-Trump talking point so it's bad to dwell on it. And while it may be true the FBI spied on the Trump campaign, this is also a pro-Trump talking point so it's good not to acknowledge it.
Judgment is teachable. Long ago, in relation to the Enron debacle, I pointed to the work of Harvard's Max Bazerman and Northwestern's David Messick, who theorized how systematic reasoning errors can lead to unethical business judgments. Journalists, don't lie to yourselves: Their advice applies to your work too.
Our industry needs to grow up by starting to police its reasoning as rigorously as it does its facts. Unfortunately, many who are employed today, when you come down to it, wouldn't really have much to say if not armed with the trope du jour. We hire the wrong people. This problem is only getting worse at places like the New York Times and Washington Post due to the kind of "advance the narrative, ring up the clicks" journalism that prevails in the marketplace today.
Yet I have confidence the U.S. media will finally face up to the unanswered questions of the 2016 election for a simple reason: If they can't blame the Trump presidency on Russian meddling, then it will please them eventually to revert to one of their earlier story lines and blame it on Mr. Comey.

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Anderson Brothers to play Duke Ellington concert

Texto completo: Duke Ellington was a major figure in the history of jazz music. His career spanned more than half a century, during which time he composed thousands of songs for the stage, screen and contemporary songbook. He created one of the most distinctive ensemble sounds in Western music and continued to play what he called “American music” until shortly before his death in 1974.
Virtuoso music talents the Anderson Brothers return to Taos for a concert focusing on this consummate American artist. Their concert is planned Saturday (April 13), 7 p.m., in the Arthur Bell Auditorium at the Harwood Museum of Art, 238 Ledoux Street.
Ellington’s fame rose to the rafters in the 1940s when he composed several masterworks, including “Concerto for Cootie,” “Cotton Tail” and “Ko-Ko.” Some of his most popular songs included “It Don’t Mean a Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing,” “Sophisticated Lady,” “Prelude to a Kiss,” “Solitude” and “Satin Doll.” A number of his hits were sung by the impressive Ivie Anderson, a favorite female vocalist of Ellington’s band.
Perhaps Ellington’s most famous jazz tune was “Take the A Train,” which was composed by Billy Strayhorn and recorded for commercial purposes on February 15, 1941. “Take the A Train,” the “A” referring to a subway line in New York City, took the place of Ellington’s previous signature tune, “Sepia Panorama.”
It was Ellington’s sense of musical drama that made him stand out. His blend of melodies, rhythms and subtle sonic movements gave audiences a new experience — complex yet accessible jazz that made the heart swing. Ellington’s autobiography, “Music Is My Mistress,” was published in 1973. Ellington earned 12 Grammy awards from 1959 to 2000, nine while he was alive.
A press announcement states that The New York Times called the Anderson Brothers “virtuosos on clarinet and saxophone.” Known for their unique renditions of classic jazz songs and innovative original music, they live in New York, where they graduated from The Juilliard School. They have headlined at preeminent venues such as the Blue Note, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center in D.C., and the New Orleans Jazz Festival –– to name just a few.
Tickets are $15; $12 for museum members and youth 18 and under. For more, call (575) 758-9826.

Russiagate and the Media's News Denial; A U.S. attorney general points the press's nose toward the real story.

Texto completo: The most universal press bias is to exaggerate the importance of whatever is being claimed or reported. Don't underestimate the role this played in Russiagate. For CNN and MSNBC, the collusion story was a commercial godsend.
When you're not thinking with your brain, you're thinking with the brain of your milieu. Virtue signaling is almost a nondescriptive term if you ask any psychologist or, increasingly, an economist: People are intensely social animals. Everything we do is about display. This also played a role in the media freak-out over Russia.
That said, I suspect at least one major news organization in this country will soon decide it can no longer afford to be dragged against its will to acknowledge the doings of U.S. intelligence agencies in the 2016 election. It will want to get on top of the story.
To be sure, grossly illegal things were done—such as intelligence leaks. But the real story, once it's pieced together starting with James Comey's original intervention in the Clinton email case, will be a concatenation of ill-advised, bumptious, politically loaded decisions whose consequences America hasn't owned up to yet.
A piquant moment was revealed by Fox anchor Brett Baier when he asked Mr. Comey last year if he had seen Obama intelligence chieftains John Brennan and James Clapper since leaving office. Mr. Comey at first equivocated and then quickly amended his statement to acknowledge that the three had dined together just two days earlier.
They are now in the soup together, but quite possibly in the soup because of the one Comey intervention that his colleagues didn't endorse—his odd decision to reopen the Hillary investigation before Election Day. Pollsters tell us this single act might have elected Donald Trump.
It will be argued late into the night, but it strikes me as entirely legitimate for the FBI to be concerned about Russian trawling of minor and outré Trump associates. If the premise was the Steele dossier, though, this may be worse than embarrassing. Understand something about the Mueller investigation: It consisted largely of asking the FBI what it already knew. The U.S. government has vast intelligence resources; it's always open season on foreign nationals like Christopher Steele. So the FBI likely knew early on a great deal about the (non)credibility of his sources and claims.
Bottom line: It's plausible, perhaps even likely, that we will find our intelligence community used exceptionally flimsy intelligence to do what it wanted to do anyway in two seminal instances: the Clinton email case (about which I've written ad nauseam) and the Trump collusion investigation.
My argument for years has been that readers can repose a high degree of trust in brand-name news organizations to spell names correctly, quote sources accurately, nail down discrete facts.
You can't trust their thinking. I have 50 examples at hand but take Chuck Todd of MSNBC, who accuses William Barr of spreading a "factless conspiracy theory" because the attorney general acknowledged this week that the FBI had spied on the Trump campaign.
A synonym for spying is "foreign intelligence surveillance"—the name of the court to which the FBI appealed four times to spy on a Trump campaign associate. This is a fact. Mr. Barr did not say such spying was unwarranted. A conspiracy theory is what MSNBC promoted on its air for two years with the Trump collusion story.
What exactly is wrong with Mr. Todd's brain? He confuses two basic categories: good/bad and true/false. He believes he's speaking in the journalistic language of true/false, but he really means: While it may be false that Trump colluded with Russia, this is a pro-Trump talking point so it's bad to dwell on it. And while it may be true the FBI spied on the Trump campaign, this is also a pro-Trump talking point so it's good not to acknowledge it.
Judgment is teachable. Long ago, in relation to the Enron debacle, I pointed to the work of Harvard's Max Bazerman and Northwestern's David Messick, who theorized how systematic reasoning errors can lead to unethical business judgments. Journalists, don't lie to yourselves: Their advice applies to your work too.
Our industry needs to grow up by starting to police its reasoning as rigorously as it does its facts. Unfortunately, many who are employed today, when you come down to it, wouldn't really have much to say if not armed with the trope du jour. We hire the wrong people. This problem is only getting worse at places like the New York Times and Washington Post due to the kind of "advance the narrative, ring up the clicks" journalism that prevails in the marketplace today.
Yet I have confidence the U.S. media will finally face up to the unanswered questions of the 2016 election for a simple reason: If they can't blame the Trump presidency on Russian meddling, then it will please them eventually to revert to one of their earlier story lines and blame it on Mr. Comey.

WikiLeaks, Already Diminished, in Limbo After Assange Arrest; Julian Assange's reputation from a prophet of radical transparency to an agenda-driven partisan eroded his group's influence even before British police detained him

Texto completo: The arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange deals a blow to the "hacktivist" organization he founded—the influence of which had already dwindled significantly in recent years.
Behind the decline, observers say, is partly the erosion of Mr. Assange's reputation from a prophet of radical transparency to an agenda-driven partisan who published emails from Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign that U.S. authorities say were stolen by Moscow.
But the organization's slide also mirrors a broader darkening of public perceptions of the internet over the past decade. Once seen as a global network that would spread freedom and democracy, the web is now—in part due to WikiLeaks and Russia—often viewed as an enabler of government surveillance and a tool to spread disinformation and polarize public opinion.
"WikiLeaks was part of a widespread utopianism," said Lisa Lynch, an associate professor of media and communications at Drew University. "Now there is this reassessment of what it means to allow unfettered free exchange of information."
On Thursday, U.K. police arrested Mr. Assange inside Ecuador's embassy in London, where he had been granted political asylum before a new government removed ended it. Mr. Assange's lawyer told journalists that the arrest could mean that "any journalist can be extradited for prosecution in the United States for having published truthful information about the United States."
WikiLeaks reacted to the arrest by saying on Twitter that "Ecuador and UK are rolling out a PR strategy they have been planning for weeks."
Founded in 2006, WikiLeaks carved out a new niche by promising to publish caches of factual information leaked from powerful institutions. Initial targets ranged from the Church of Scientology to the far right British National Party, according to the organization's website. The organization's global profile peaked in 2010, after publishing more than 250,000 U.S. State Department cables and 500,000 other files related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The source of the leak was Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. soldier who was imprisoned between 2010 and 2017 before her 35-year sentence was commuted. But it was Mr. Assange and his shock of white hair that became ubiquitous as he traveled the globe. Earlier that year he delivered a 2010 TED talk entitled "Why the World Needs WikiLeaks." Asked during the talk to explain his philosophy, Mr. Assange said that he prioritized exposing what is kept secret for the greater good.
"Information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing, that's a really good signal that when the information gets out, there's a hope of it doing some good," Mr. Assange said. WikiLeaks hasn't commented on the incident.
Later in 2010, Mr. Assange said he planned to release a trove of information about Bank of America, raising fears that Corporate America was next on his list after governments. But as is the case for any security researcher seeking vulnerabilities across the web, WikiLeaks' success in obtaining data partly came down to opportunism and luck. The promise of explosive information about the bank never materialized.
Questions also began to loom about how WikiLeaks obtained its information. WikiLeaks had stated it didn't solicit information and largely received third-party data that it was offered. But in 2012, as a global "hacktivist" collective known as Anonymous began launching ideologically driven cyberattacks against some websites, one of Mr. Assange's confidants was seen soliciting data on Iceland's government from Anonymous hackers in a chat room.
WikiLeaks' involvement in publishing hacked emails during the 2016 election further changed the reputation of the group and Mr. Assange.
"Originally, the goal was to disrupt power. Now he has an obvious agenda," said Charlie Beckett, a media professor at the London School of Economics who wrote a 2012 book on WikiLeaks. "The trust in Assange's good faith is completely blown away."
Despite WikiLeaks' diminished reputation and Mr. Assange's isolation, the group has managed to remain a thorn in the side of U.S. authorities. In early 2017, it released documents describing hacking tools and techniques that it said were used by the CIA in cyber operations.
At the same time, the collaborative model of publishing leaked information that Mr. Assange pioneered in the 2010 cable leaks—where he worked with newspapers including the New York Times—has spread without him. A group of investigative journalists from around the world used a similar model in 2016 to publish the Panama Papers, based on leaked documents from a law firm that implicated prominent individuals and companies in tax fraud.
It remains to be seen whether WikiLeaks will survive Mr. Assange's arrest. WikiLeaks has never been transparent about who works for it, but many staffers who were close to Mr. Assange in 2010 have since left the organization, people who keep track of WikiLeaks said. Observers say Mr. Assange appeared to be closely involved in the organization, even during some of his years in Ecuador's embassy.
"It was extraordinarily dependent on him," Mr. Beckett said. "In that sense there's a kind of disappointment that this kind of leaks model seems to have collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions."

Texto completo: HARTFORD, Conn. - Charles Van Doren, the dashing young academic whose meteoric rise and fall as a corrupt game show contestant in the 1950s inspired the movie "Quiz Show and served as a cautionary tale about the staged competitions of early television, has died. He was 93.
He died of natural causes Tuesday at a care center for the elderly in Canaan, Connecticut, said his son, John Van Doren. Funeral services will be private.
The handsome scion of a prominent literary family, Van Doren was the central figure in the TV game show scandals of the late 1950s and eventually pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to a grand jury that investigated them. He spent the following decades largely out of the public eye.
"It's been hard to get away, partly because the man who cheated on Twenty-One' is still part of me, he wrote in a 2008 New Yorker essay, his first public comment in years.
Before his downfall, he was a ratings sensation. He made 14 electrifying appearances on "Twenty-One in late 1956 and early '57, vanquishing 13 competitors and winning a then-record $129,000. NBC hired him as a commentator.
In a February 1957 cover story on Van Doren, Time magazine marveled at the "fascinating, suspense-taut spectacle of his highly trained mind at work.
"Just by being himself, Time wrote, "he has enabled a giveaway show, the crassest of lowbrow entertainments, to whip up a doting mass audience for a new kind of TV idol - of all things, an egghead.
Later, as the triumph unraveled into scandal, he initially denied he had been given advance answers, but he finally admitted that the show was rigged.
He retreated to his family's home in rural West Cornwall, Connecticut, after telling a congressional committee in 1959 that he was coached before each segment of the show.
After spending much of the 1960s and '70s in Chicago, Van Doren and his wife, Geraldine, returned to Connecticut, residing for years in a small brown bungalow on the family compound. They did some teaching but largely lived in semi-seclusion, refusing to grant interviews and even leaving the country for several weeks when Robert Redford's film "Quiz Show was released in the fall of 1994.
Van Doren refused to cooperate in the movie's making and declined to meet with actor Ralph Fiennes, who portrayed him in the film. Fiennes later told People magazine that after Van Doren brushed him off, he knocked on his door pretending to be lost so he could observe Van Doren's movements and speech patterns.
Van Doren broke his silence in 2008, writing an account of his downfall in The New Yorker and how he finally had publicly admitted a half-century earlier that he was "foolish, naive, prideful and avaricious.
"People who knew the entertainment business didn't have much doubt about what was going on, although they didn't speak out, he wrote.
In light of the large profits the rigged game shows were making, he added, "why would they?
He also disclosed that he eventually did watch "Quiz Show and laughed at an insulting reference that a character made about him. He said he had been tempted to take a consulting fee from the producers, but his wife talked him out of it.
Van Doren's family had a proud literary standing at the time of the scandal. His father, Mark Van Doren, was a critic, biographer and poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1940. His uncle, Carl Van Doren, received a Pulitzer in 1939 for a biography of Benjamin Franklin.
Charles Van Doren was himself a rising young academic at Columbia when he became famous on the quiz show. He went on to win $129,000 on the show after defeating Herbert Stempel, a New Yorker portrayed by John Turturro in the movie.
Stempel later went public and said contestants were fed the answers to the questions prior to the show. He said he was told to lose because the show's producers thought Van Doren had star potential.
In 1962, Van Doren and nine other winners from three NBC shows - "Twenty-One, 'Tic-Tac-Dough and "Hi-Lo - pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury that had investigated the scandal. They were spared jail terms by a judge who said the nation's scorn was punishment enough.
After the scandal broke, Van Doren lost the $50,000-a-year job NBC gave him when he defeated Stempel. He also was dropped from the faculty at Columbia, where his father had been a professor for decades.
Friends said Van Doren's family was shocked by his eventual revelation that he had been given the answers in advance.
Bucky Whitney, a longtime friend, recalled the family's shame.
"His father took it real hard. The old man was never the same after that, Whitney told a reporter who visited Cornwall when "Quiz Show came out.
Van Doren later joined the Institute for Philosophical Research, a nonprofit Chicago think tank, and worked at Chicago-based Encyclopaedia Britannica for many years. Among his books were "The Idea of Progress, a philosophical work, and "A History of Knowledge; Past, Present, and Future.
Van Doren and his wife had two children, Elizabeth and John.
"He was a loving husband and a terrific father, and he's going to be deeply missed, John Van Doren said.
In West Cornwall, neighbors were protective of "Charley, as Van Doren was affectionately known.
Walter DeTheir, the proprietor of a store in Cornwall, said Van Doren was a quiet, shy man who came in regularly to pick up the Sunday New York Times.
"It's not that he isn't friendly, he just doesn't have much to say, DeTheir said.
In his New Yorker piece, Van Doren said he liked to avoid "people who say, Aren't you Charles Van Doren?' Well, that's my name, I say to myself, but I'm not who you think I am - or, at least, I don't want to be.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig expects to be indicted in the coming days on charges stemming from work he performed for Ukraine in 2012, Mr. Craig's legal team said.
Mr. Craig has refused to accept a plea deal, and the matter could be presented to a grand jury for indictment as soon as Thursday, people familiar with the matter say. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
The people familiar with the situation say they believe Mr. Craig will be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department unit that oversees the activities of foreign agents, though other charges are possible.
An indictment of Mr. Craig is likely to send shock waves through the U.S. legal community and is the latest fallout from an investigation into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his years of work for the pro-Russia regime in power in Kiev.
The 74-year-old Mr. Craig is a legal heavyweight who served in senior legal roles for two Democratic presidents. He has also been a top State Department adviser and Capitol Hill aide.
"This case was thoroughly investigated by the SDNY and that office decided not to pursue charges against Mr. Craig. We expect an indictment by the DC US Attorney's Office at the request of the National Security Division. Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion," lawyers for Mr. Craig said in a statement.
The matters surrounding Mr. Craig have taken a winding path. It was first developed by special counsel Robert Mueller before being transferred to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, known as SDNY, and then was transferred again to Washington. The national security division of the Justice Department -- which has ramped up its enforcement of foreign lobbying laws -- is heavily involved, the people say.
The possible charges stem from the Ukrainian government's hiring of Mr. Craig and his then-law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in 2012 to evaluate the corruption trial of the former Ukrainian prime minister. Mr. Craig spoke to several reporters about the findings of the firm's report, touching off a dispute with the Justice Department about whether that qualified as lobbying for a foreign government in the U.S.
Skadden Arps entered into a $4.6 million civil settlement with the Justice Department in January, acknowledging it misled the Justice Department about its Ukraine work. In the settlement, the firm blamed Mr. Craig for providing the government with the misleading information. Skadden Arps also belatedly registered as a foreign agent as part of the settlement.
Mr. Craig was interviewed twice by Mr. Mueller's office. He left Skadden Arps in April 2018. According to letters obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Craig and the Justice Department engaged in a back-and-forth that began in 2012 and continued for more than a year about whether Skadden Arps had an obligation to register as a foreign agent.
The allegedly false statement that government investigators have homed in on involves the timing of Mr. Craig's interactions with reporters, including David Sanger of the New York Times, according to the people familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the New York Times said the newspaper hadn't received a subpoena in the matter and hadn't provided information to the government.
Mr. Craig didn't bill his client for his interactions with Mr. Sanger, the people say, bolstering his argument that he was speaking to a reporter in his personal capacity.

Texto completo: Ten years ago, a mutual friend introduced Paul Arguin to Chris Taylor, thinking they'd make a good match. Upon discovering they both loved to bake, the two doctors mapped out a date. Since they lived in different cities -- Arguin in Atlanta, and Taylor in Pittsburgh -- they decided that they would bake a recipe from their copies of Rose Levy Beranbaum's "The Cake Bible" while getting acquainted on the phone.
They talked their way through every step of an over-the-top Bavarian bombe covered with jellyroll slices, "disconnecting only when the whirs of our stand mixers were too loud for conversation."
That experiment, they explain in the introduction to their new cookbook, "typified what would come to be our shared baking style -- bold, unafraid to try something new, and often untraditional." Now married, the couple continues to push the boundaries of that style in their Atlanta kitchen, and in baking contests across the U.S. They've won hundreds of awards, including the 2017 National Pie Championships title that landed them a splashy story in the New York Times, and then a book deal.
In "The New Pie:Modern techniques for the classic American dessert" (Potter, $30), they lay out their scientifically precise formulas for success, each depicted in eye-popping detail by Atlanta photographer Andrew Thomas Lee -- from the Toffee Cream with Crunch modeled after a Kit Kat candy bar, to the 6151 Richmond inspired by episodes of "The Golden Girls" involving cheesecake. Sitting in my fridge now is Thai Iced Tea Pie, an exotically spiced pudding in a perfectly crisp crust crowned with "ice cubes" made of whipped cream -- not as jaw-drop-ping as the photo, but definitely a showstopper by my standards.
Some of the recipes call for ingredients you may need to order online (xanthan gum, popping sugar) or tools you may not have (airbrush gun, immersion circulator). Degree of difficulty varies, but most will require more planning than for a standard pecan pie. The more you delve into these tantalizing pages, the more likely you'll be convinced that your efforts will be rewarded -- with high praise from guests, or maybe even a blue ribbon.

TOP NATIONAL STORY MUELLER REPORT: Barr: 'Spying' on campaign needs look: Attorney General William Barr, appearing before Congress for a second straight day on Wednesday, said the government spied on the Trump campaign and said he would look into whether any rules were violated.

Texto completo: With the Russia investigation complete, Barr said he was preparing to review "both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign," including possible improper "spying" by U.S. intelligence agencies.
"I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal," Barr said, adding that he believed "spying did occur." President Donald Trump and his allies have accused the FBI and other government officials of abusing their power and launching the Russia investigation to sabotage the president.
"I am not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it's important to look at them," Barr said. Later he said he wanted to ensure that there was no "improper surveillance" -- not suggesting there had been, but that the possibility warranted review.
It was not immediately clear to what Barr was referring, and he did not present evidence to back up his statement.
The FBI obtained a secret surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, after he left the campaign, and reports have suggested it used at least one confidential informer to collect information on campaign associates.
Barr said that he will work with FBI Director Christopher Wray to examine the origins of the bureau's counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, and that he would soon set up a team for that effort. He noted that Congress and the Justice Department's inspector general have already completed investigations of that matter, and that after reviewing those investigations he would be able to see whether there were any "remaining questions to be addressed."
On discussions with Mueller
Under intense questioning from Democratic senators, Barr shed some additional light on Robert Mueller's decision not to reach a prosecutorial decision about whether Trump criminally obstructed the investigation and his own decision to conclude in his letter to Congress delivering the investigation's conclusions last month that the evidence did not meet that bar.
Barr said he had spoken with Mueller about why he did not reach a decision on obstruction of justice, but declined to offer details of their conversations. The attorney general said that Mueller did not explicitly ask that Congress be allowed to judge the evidence and decide for itself, nor did he say that the attorney general should.
"But that is generally how the Department of Justice works," Barr said, saying that the department's job is to make prosecutorial decisions -- and he had.
Democrats in the House have criticized Barr for what they view as his refusal to share the investigation's underlying evidence and material he may redact from the report. But Barr told senators on Wednesday he would be willing to reevaluate that decision to try to accommodate lawmakers' concerns.
"I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the chairmen and ranking members of each, what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that," he said.
Democratic lawmakers say that they need such material so they can fully understand the implications of Mueller's findings and judge whether or not Barr had fairly represented what was found.
In the House, they have already approved a subpoena to issue to try to compel the release of this kind of information.
On briefing the White House
Barr again declined to say whether he had briefed the White House on the fuller Mueller report, even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House.
His refusal to say one way or the other raised the possibility that since then, the Justice Department may have briefed Trump or his inner circle about its contents.
"I'm landing the plane right now," Barr said under Democratic questioning. "I have been willing to discuss my letter and the process going forward. The report is going to be out next week and I'm not just going into the details of the process."

MUELLER REPORT RELEASE
Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday that he "hoped" to make the redacted Mueller report public "next week."The answer differed slightly from what he told House lawmakers on Tuesday, that he intended to put out the report "within a week."
He said Justice Department lawyers and members of Mueller's team, who are reviewing the report for sensitive information to black out before release, would not remove information that would harm the "reputational interests"of Trump.Barr also said that he had not overruled Mueller's team on any proposed redactions from the Mueller report, and had not discussed with the White House what he was blacking out.
TRUMP COMMENTS ON INVESTIGATION
Speaking to reporters as he left the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump criticized the investigation as an illegal "attempted coup."But he said he had "won"and could care less about the report itself.
"I have not seen the Mueller report,"Trump told reporters. "I have not read the Mueller report. I won.No collusion, no obstruction. I won. Everybody knows I won."

Texto completo: President Trump's older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, has retired as a federal appellate judge, ending an investigation into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in fraudulent tax schemes with her siblings.
The court inquiry stemmed from complaints filed last October, after an investigation by The New York Times found that the Trumps had engaged in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the inherited wealth of Mr. Trump and his siblings. Judge Barry not only benefited financially from most of those tax schemes, The Times found; she was also in a position to influence the actions taken by her family.
Judge Barry, now 82, has not heard cases in more than two years but was still listed as an inactive senior judge, one step short of full retirement. In a letter dated Feb. 1, a court official notified the four individuals who had filed the complaints that the investigation was "receiving the full attention" of a judicial conduct council. Ten days later, Judge Barry filed her retirement papers.
The status change rendered the investigation moot, since retired judges are not subject to the conduct rules. The people who filed the complaints were notified last week that the matter had been dropped without a finding on the merits of the allegations. The decision has not yet been made public, but copies were provided to The Times by two of the complainants. Both are involved in the legal profession.
Judge Barry did not respond to emails or telephone messages left at her Manhattan apartment.
Judicial council reviews can result in the censure or reprimand of federal judges, and in extremely rare cases, a referral to the House of Representatives for impeachment.
In retirement, Judge Barry is entitled to receive annually the salary she earned when she last met certain workload requirements. Though the exact figure was not immediately available, it appears to be between $184,500 and $217,600.
The Times investigation focused on how the profits and ownership of the real estate empire built by the president's father, Fred C. Trump, were transferred to Donald J. Trump and his siblings, often in ways designed to dodge gift and estate taxes.
A lawyer for the president, Charles J. Harder, said last fall, "The New York Times's allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory."
Judge Barry had been a co-owner of a shell company -- All County Building Supply & Maintenance -- created by the family to siphon cash from their father's empire by marking up purchases already made by his employees, The Times investigation found. Judge Barry, her siblings and a cousin split the markup, free of gift and estate taxes, which at the time were levied at a much higher rate than income taxes.
On a financial disclosure form filed in 1999, Judge Barry noted that her share of the All County profits for the previous 17 months totaled just over $1 million.
The family also used the padded invoices to justify higher rent increases in rent-regulated buildings, artificially inflating the rents of thousands of tenants. Former prosecutors told The Times that if the authorities had discovered at the time how the Trumps were using All County, their actions would have warranted a criminal investigation for defrauding tenants, tax fraud and filing false documents.
Similarly, Judge Barry benefited from the gross undervaluation of her father's properties when she and her siblings took ownership of them through a trust, sparing them from paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes, The Times found. For years, she attended regular briefings at her brother's offices in Trump Tower to hear updates on the real estate portfolio and to collect her share of the profits. When the siblings sold off their father's empire, between 2004 and 2006, her share of the windfall was $182.5 million, The Times found.
Judge Barry was nominated to the Federal District Court in New Jersey by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, after several years as a federal prosecutor. She was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by President Bill Clinton in 1999.
In February 2017, shortly after her brother's inauguration, she notified the court that she would stop hearing cases and give up her staff and chambers. She was then considered a senior inactive judge, a status that did not entitle her to salary increases, but that left her still subject to conduct inquiries. Judge Barry did not announce a reason for the change at the time.
Following confidentiality requirements, Judge Barry's name does not appear on the order ending the investigation or the correspondence with the complainants. The order identifies the judge in question as a senior inactive judge, about whom complaints were filed in October 2018. Under court rules, all complaints are reviewed by a judge, and those with an allegation of misconduct or disability are generally referred to a panel of judges for investigation.
"The complaints allege, on the basis of a news article, that the then-inactive senior circuit judge may have committed misconduct relating to tax and financial transactions," says the order, dated April 1.
The complaints had been transferred to the Second Circuit to avoid conflicts with judges who knew Judge Barry.
Scott Shuchart, a lawyer who filed one of the complaints, said he had done so as a concerned member of the legal profession. He said he found it "galling" that Judge Barry, while still receiving her federal pension, was now immune from judicial misconduct proceedings "just because she changed from one form of retired status to another."
In an opinion article last October for The Washington Post, Mr. Shuchart wrote that he had quit his job at the Department of Homeland Security, where he had served since the Obama administration, because he believed that the Trump administration's family-separation policy at the southern border was unconstitutional.
Around that time, Mr. Shuchart joined the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning public policy and advocacy group, as a senior fellow focused on immigration issues. But, he said, he filed the complaint against Judge Barry on his own, independent of any organized effort.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Attorney General William P. Barr said on Wednesday that even after he released a partly blacked-out copy of the Mueller report, most likely next week, he would work to share with Congress some of the more sensitive information that he redacted.
Mr. Barr also told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that while he intends to black out derogatory information about "peripheral third parties," he would not take out criticisms of public office holders, including President Trump.
Democrats have attacked Mr. Barr for releasing only a four-page letter on March 24 with what he called the report's "bottom-line findings": that the evidence the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, gathered did not show any conspiracy between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia, and that while the special counsel took no position on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice, Mr. Barr deemed him cleared.
Lawmakers have demanded to see the unredacted report, a request Mr. Barr tried to address on Wednesday.
"I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the chairmen and ranking members of each, what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that," Mr. Barr told the senators.
His assurance did not mollify them. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, told him that any attempt to hide pieces of the report would "only fuel suspicions that the Justice Department, which represents the United States, is playing the role of President Trump's defense team."
Even while Mr. Barr sought to reassure lawmakers that he would treat the report in a transparent and fair manner, he also made a startling statement sure to please the president -- that investigative steps by the F.B.I. in 2016 to understand links between the Trump campaign and Russia amounted to "spying" on Mr. Trump's campaign, a portrayal law enforcement officials have vehemently denied.
[Read about the attorney general's assertion that intelligence agencies spied on the Trump campaign.]
The attorney general was testifying about the Justice Department budget for the second straight day. But as happened on Tuesday, when he appeared before a House panel, questions about the Trump-Russia investigation led by Mr. Mueller and his still-secret full report dominated the hearing.
Mr. Barr glancingly addressed a mystery raised by his March 24 letter, which did not explain why Mr. Mueller had rendered no judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice -- a silence that left open possibilities, including that the special counsel had wanted Mr. Barr to make the call, and that Mr. Mueller had intended for Congress to receive the evidence without the department weighing in.
On Wednesday, Mr. Barr said that he had talked to Mr. Mueller about why he made no conclusion, and that the special counsel had not mentioned either of those possibilities to him. But the attorney general hinted that the answer might be known soon, saying that Mr. Mueller "has a fuller explanation of that in the report that I'll be making available hopefully next week."
Mr. Barr again declined to say whether he had recently briefed the White House on details of the report, even though Justice Department officials had previously said it had not been shown to the White House.
The hearing also addressed criticism of the F.B.I.'s early decisions in 2016 to open a counterintelligence investigation into Russia's election-meddling operations that included scrutinizing any links between Russia and associates of the Trump campaign. The investigation, which Mr. Mueller took over the next spring, included assigning an informant to approach members of the Trump campaign with links to Russia and later obtaining a court order to wiretap a former Trump adviser with links to Russia after he left the campaign.
During that part of the discussion, Mr. Barr used a startling word to describe those steps -- he said he thought "spying" on the Trump campaign had occurred. But he later seemed to tone down that formulation, saying his concern was whether "illegal surveillance" had taken place that was not "adequately predicated" -- and conceding that he had "no specific evidence that I would cite right now."
Responding to Mr. Barr's testimony, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter: "These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us. I've asked DOJ to brief us immediately. In the meantime, the AG still owes us the full Mueller report."
Meanwhile on Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for Jeffrey A. Rosen, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be Mr. Barr's deputy. Mr. Rosen, who is currently the deputy secretary of transportation, would succeed Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller.
Mr. Rosen largely sidestepped questions about the Russia investigation and Mueller report, saying he was not part of the department yet and did not know the facts. But Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, noted that some criminal matters that developed from Mr. Mueller's work are continuing even though the Office of the Special Counsel is shutting down, and she pressed Mr. Rosen to commit to letting them proceed without political interference.
"If I am confirmed," Mr. Rosen replied, "I would expect in all prosecutorial matters to proceed on the facts and the law and not any improper political influences."
Ms. Klobuchar did not name which matters she had in mind, though several cases are still working their way through the court system, including the indictment of Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser to Mr. Trump.
Separately, under questioning by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, Mr. Rosen defended his role in creating a Trump administration proposal on tailpipe pollution rules. Ms. Feinstein referred to a New York Times article that portrayed him as pushing to let cars emit more greenhouse gases. Mr. Rosen said the article had several errors, although he did not identify them.
He also said the issue was how to carry out a law that required annual increases in fuel economy standards through 2020, and then set criteria for decisions about whether to require any further escalations in the years after that. The Trump administration, he said, was merely proposing a "timeout" after 2020.
In fact, the current regulations, put forth by the Obama administration, require automakers to keep improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles through 2025. The administration's preferred proposal would therefore allow more greenhouse gas pollution than current rules.
Mr. Rosen also portrayed himself as playing a "managerial" role in overseeing the drafting of the rule, such as by ensuring deadlines were met. But 11 people interviewed by The Times at the time of the negotiation said Mr. Rosen pushed forcefully for that outcome.
Mr. Rosen also addressed criticism that he -- like Mr. Barr and Brian A. Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division -- had no prosecutorial experience.
He noted that the department had many experienced prosecutors, and said, "I would make it my job to utilize and leverage the expertise they bring to bear while combining that with my own experience and judgment."

Liberal groups seek to hamstring Nielsen's private-sector prospects

Texto completo: Kirstjen Nielsen's support for the Trump administration's family separation policy followed her to a Mexican restaurant, where protesters yelled "Shame!" as she finished her meal.
It followed her to her home, where activists chanted into bullhorns and held signs proclaiming Nielsen a "child snatcher."
Now, as the former homeland security secretary exits the Trump administration, a coalition of liberal groups is seeking to prevent her from going on to the type of lucrative private-sector job or speaking gig that many former Cabinet officials take upon leaving public service.
"This is not a normal administration. This was not a normal policy. And the people who participated in that policy do not deserve normal treatment," said Karl Frisch, a spokesman for the advocacy group Restore Public Trust, which has spearheaded efforts to pressure companies not to hire Nielsen. "They have to be held accountable for what they've done. They've left thousands of families traumatized because of their negligence."
A DHS spokesman declined to comment on the effort by liberal critics and on Nielsen's future.
More than four dozen top officials have left the Trump administration since the president took office in January 2017 and began a tumultuous tenure that has often colored the reputations of aides and Cabinet members.
Some have emphasized their differences with Trump on the way out. Former defense secretary Jim Mattis, for instance, resigned over differences with Trump on Syria and is returning next month to his position at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.
But others, such as Nielsen, have tied their fortunes to Trump - making for a sometimes rocky reentry into the private sphere.
As homeland security secretary, Nielsen became the public face of Trump's broadly criticized policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. On Monday, she thanked Trump and voiced continued support for his efforts to reduce illegal immigration.
"I share the president's goal of securing the border," Nielsen said in an exchange with reporters outside her home in Virginia. "I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border."
Even before her forced resignation, liberal groups, immigrant rights advocates and others had launched an effort to pressure companies not to hire Nielsen and more than two dozen other Trump administration officials who were involved in implementing and defending the family separation policy.
The campaign, led by Restore Public Trust, included a letter last week to Fortune 500 company CEOs as well as an ad in the New York Times with the message, "Attention corporate America: Don't let hate into your boardroom."
The decision over whether to hire a former Trump administration official can create a quandary for a university or think tank, which can benefit from an official's experiences and inside knowledge but face public backlash.
Several former Trump officials have been met with resistance as they have moved from the administration to other roles.
Marc Short, Trump's former legislative affairs director, and Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary, also faced public opposition when they were awarded fellowships by the University of Virginia and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, respectively. In the case of Short, who now serves as Vice President Pence's chief of staff, two historians resigned from the Virginia center that granted him the fellowship.
Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, declined to discuss Nielsen's specific case but said in general, universities should expose students to different viewpoints, as uncomfortable as they may be.
"Whether that be a speaker or whether that be a student's right to protest a speaker, that is all part of the dialogue that is acceptable," he said. "The role of the university is to keep its students safe from harm but not safe from ideas."
Cabinet secretaries typically go on to a range of pursuits after leaving government. Former DHS secretary Janet Napolitano, for instance, is the president of the University of California system. Others sit on corporate boards, open their own consulting businesses, write books or make top dollar on the public speaking circuit.
Spicer said in an interview that there's "no question" there will be a market for Nielsen's skills and national security expertise.
"For people like Kirstjen, there's always going to be companies that have an interest in hearing from her expertise and her counsel," he said. "This is a huge country, and a lot of business gets done in that realm, and she's got a tremendous amount of expertise at a critical time."
Before joining the Trump administration, Nielsen was a senior fellow at George Washington University's Center for Cyber and Homeland Security and worked as a private cybersecurity consultant.
John Sandweg, a former top aide to Napolitano and acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President Barack Obama, said the complicated politics of Nielsen's situation combined with a résumé that is less extensive relative to some of her predecessors leave her in a "diminished state" compared with some of her predecessors.
"She embraced some very controversial, disliked policies," Sandweg said. "I would point to family separation; I think that hurts her legacy and could hurt her in the private sector. . . . At the same time, with the president's base, she isn't necessarily loved there and was dismissed by the president."

Playing ball in college, so you won't have to

Texto completo: A college consultant named William Singer was the ringleader who allegedly helped 800 students buy and cheat their way into elite schools. The revelation has been nothing short of revolting. The story has the public so hungry for details that people are actually reading indictments so as not to miss a thing.

Even die-hard followers of this traumatizing tale, however, may be in need of a laugh. If so, have I got the movie for you!

Released in 1989 and instantly forgotten, the gloriously goofy “How I Got into College,” starring Anthony Edwards, hilariously laid out all manner of back doors and side doors for the underachieving student, including the path of the phony athletic career. The shameless tactics on parade worked for most of the movie’s characters, and until lately, worked well enough for dozens of real-life charlatans now being prosecuted for trying to wheedle their way into coveted colleges they thought their offspring deserved.

This trippy, over-the-top flick pulled in a measly $1.6 million at the domestic box office in its 1989 debut. But what a difference a giant pay- not- to-play scandal makes!

Terrel Seltzer’s screenplay has held up incredibly well. She’s got the athletic coach with his hand out. The unctuous “legacy” who insists that his son cannot be expected to follow the ordinary rules of getting in. Admission officers readily seduced by applicants’ numbers on paper. Slick college consultants, played to the nines by Nora Dunn and Phil Hartman, who never met a “late-bloomer” they could not help for the right sum of money.

When our hero, Marlon Browne, played by Corey Parker, enters their lair seeking help with his applications, Nora Dunn’s character, Francine, quickly ditches her Pro Wrestling magazine to chime into her phone, “Duke, can you hold please, I have Georgetown on the other line.”

“For $1,000, we can make anyone’s life sound interesting,” she assures Marlon, doubtful that his test scores or Saturdays babysitting his stepbrother would impress anyone.

“What you need is a hook,” booms Phil Hartman’s character, Bennedict. “Something for the committee to remember you by.”

Earlier, the pair had quizzed their quarry if he played any sports. “If you’re good, it’s always going to help you,” Bennedict insisted before he and Francine pepper Marlon about all the sports where he could be a contender:

“Football? Baseball? Soccer? Swimming? Lacrosse? Wrestling? Water Polo? Discus? Tennis? Volleyball? Javelin? Something…?” they suggest, getting nowhere. Marlon finally volunteers that he once won a neighborhood ping-pong match.

Most of Marlon’s friends are no better off. Asked by pals if she planned on retaking the SAT, one tearful classmate laments, “I have to. With the scores I have now, I can only get into the schools I’d never go to.”

Even Marlon’s romantic interest, Jessica Kailo, played by Lara Flynn Boyle, thought to be a shoo-in at one alluring college, thinks her life is over after bungling her interview with a chancy move. Marlon reassures her that she will not be branded a “moron for life” once she gets to college, or be ruined. “Trying things out is what happens in college,’’ he counsels her. “You get a great chance to start out all over again just when most people need to. It’s like a federal protection and relocation program for teenagers.”

It’s that sweet heart inside the stinging satire that makes this movie fun. And if you, like me, missed this gem the first-time round, lucky for us, it’s now streaming on Amazon Prime with HBO Go. Somewhere, I hope someone is toasting Terrel Seltzer on her late-bloomer of a story.

Texto completo: For those of you who are not fans of "Game of Thrones," you can stop reading this article now. For those who are, however, you know what happens this weekend: the premiere of season eight of "Game of Thrones," set for 9 p.m. Sunday night on HBO.
After nearly two years of waiting, over the next six weeks we'll finally find out what happens to all our beloved -- and not-so-beloved -- characters. How will you be getting ready for the big night? Here's a Maine-centric guide to celebrating the final rounds of the game of thrones.
Get informed
It will take you two days, 15 hours and 30 minutes to watch all seven seasons of "Game of Thrones" that have been released so far. If you took both Thursday and Friday off from work and devoted both those days plus Saturday and Sunday to watching all 67 episodes, you could still make it in time for the premiere on Sunday night. You'd have to watch for 17 full hours each day starting at 6 a.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and another 12 hours on Sunday, but you could do it, and still get six hours of sleep and 10-minute breaks between episodes. Then, you'd be fully up to speed in time for the season eight premiere. You'd also be exhausted.
Or, you could just watch one of several really good full-series recaps available. One of the best ones out there is by Screen Junkies, which crammed all seven seasons into one epic 52-minute YouTube recap. Several national publications have also done extensive full-series recaps in print, including very good showings from both Vanity Fair and The New York Times.

If you didn't know already, there are some really cool local connections to the show. Maine company Glacier Wear out of Greenville outfits Night's Watch and Wildling cast members with furs and pelts. Beau Chemin Farm in Waldoboro is tasked with preserving the rare Icelandic goat -- the same species of goat that Daenerys' dragon Drogon scarfs up while roving the Essos countryside. And don't forget -- the happily departed Littlefinger was played by Aidan Gillen, who starred in "Beneath the Harvest Sky," which was shot in and around Van Buren! Check out his St. John Valley accent!
How to pregame
There are several cool GoT events statewide leading up to the big day. On Thursday, Queen City Cinema Club in downtown Bangor will host an epic trivia night and costume party, set for 9 p.m. On Friday in Brewer, Generations Boutique on State Street will host a GoT-themed Paint and Sip and Trivia event, set for 5:30 p.m., and with a $35 fee.
On Sunday, you can start the day in true Westeros style, with a GoT-themed brunch at Enoteca Athena in Brunswick, set for 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and featuring such delights as House Tyrell's Cheese and Onion Pie, Arya's Oysters and Tyroshi Honey Fingers.

What to eat and drink
Westeros is a place that loves its alcohol, and correspondingly, there are lots of different adult beverages themed to the show. In Maine, Portland brewery Liquid Riot last year unveiled A Beer Has No Name, a double IPA themed to Arya's mysterious mentor-turned-enemy, Jaqen H'ghar. New York brewery Ommegang has released beers themed to each season of the show; presently available are sour blend Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, smoked porter Mother of Dragons, imperial stout King in the North, barleywine Hand of the Queen and golden ale For The Throne. Check your local beer store for any of these brews.
Not a beer person? California winemaker Bob Cabral has created a GoT-themed red blend and a Chardonnay that you can pretend is actually Dornish Red and Arbor Gold. And don't underestimate the ability of HBO to slap "Game of Thrones" branding on anything and everything -- there are Thrones-branded Oreos and Mountain Dew in supermarkets, there are five limited-edition Adidas sneakers themed to houses Stark, Targaryen and Lannister, and the Night's Watch, and there's an array of GoT-themed makeup palettes by cosmetics company Urban Decay.
Where to watch
For a show with as immense a cultural resonance as "Game of Thrones," there are surprisingly few public screenings of Sunday's premiere. In fact, the only one we can find in Maine is at Smitty's Cinemas, a chain of cinemas with restaurants in southern Maine, which will show each episode of the new season of "Game of Thrones" for free each Sunday; Smitty's has locations in Biddeford, Sanford, Windham and Topsham.
Chances are, you'll be watching Sunday night's season eight premiere from the comfort of your own home -- perhaps after enjoying a meal themed to the show, featuring one of the amazing Westerosi recipes from the Inn at the Crossroads website. You, and millions of others, will take one last trip to the Seven Kingdoms. Valar Morghulis!

Texto completo: Kiernan Shipka and Stanley Tucci star in a new Netflix horror movie. And "The Girl on the Train" airs on FX.
What's Streaming
THE SILENCE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Bloodthirsty, apocalypse-inducing creatures who hunt by sound. A family thrown into survival mode, with a daughter who is deaf. Sound familiar? This sensory-deprivation horror movie is bound to draw comparisons to "A Quiet Place," John Krasinski's directorial breakthrough that drew praise last year for its portrayal of family drama under terrifying circumstances. "The Silence," based on a 2015 novel, also imagines a world transformed by sound-sensitive people-killers. Kiernan Shipka, who plays the title character in Netflix's "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina," stars in this film as Ally, a teenager whose family learns sign language after an accident leaves Ally unable to hear. That form of communication takes on a new usefulness when the world is hit with a winged pestilence: batlike creatures attracted to noise and flesh. Miranda Otto, who plays one of Sabrina's aunts in "Sabrina," here plays Ally's mother (presumably coincidentally); Stanley Tucci plays Ally's father.
FINDING YOUR FEET (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Imelda Staunton and Celia Imrie star as estranged sisters in this romantic comedy. Staunton plays Sandra, a suburbanite who, after discovering that her husband is having an affair, moves in with her more freewheeling sister (Imrie). There, she finds freedom via smoking marijuana and beginning a new romance with a retiree played by Timothy Spall. In her review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the movie has "an embarrassingly on-the-nose soundtrack and plot twists you can see coming without your bifocals." Still, she called it "comfort food for the young at heart."
GREAT PERFORMANCES: JULIUS CAESAR Stream on PBS.org. Phyllida Lloyd's assertive all-female production of "Julius Caesar" began what became an acclaimed trilogy of productions born at the Donmar Warehouse in London, all of which imagine Shakespeare plays staged by inmates in a women's prison. In a review for The Times after this production's premiere in 2013, Matt Wolf asked, "Who would have guessed that the London production currently boasting the greatest testosterone also happens not to have a single man in its cast?" In a Times review after the production had transferred to New York, Ben Brantley wrote that Lloyd's staging "has a muscular strength and ferocity guaranteed to keep everyone in the theater in sustained fight-or-flight mode." In this film of the live play, Harriet Walter stars as Brutus, with Jackie Clune (Caesar), Martina Laird (Cassius) and Jade Anouka (Mark Antony).
What's on TV
THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN (2016) 5:30 p.m. on FX. Paula Hawkins was an unknown author before her 2015 mystery novel, "The Girl on the Train," skipped its way to the top of the New York Times best-seller list. The following year, Emily Blunt starred in this movie version, directed by Tate Taylor. Like the book, the film dances between different perspectives in telling the story of the disappearance of the lady on the rail car.

José James to headline TC Jazz Festival

Texto completo: This summer’s Twin Cities Jazz Festival – the 21st; let’s pause to consider that feat – will take place in St. Paul’s Lowertown June 20-22. A parade of jazz stars will cross the main stage in scenic Mears Park. Local bands will heat up a second stage nearby. The Larry Englund Memorial Youth Stage, named in honor of the late and beloved radio host, DJ and lifelong music booster, will feature young artists including the Walker West Combo and the Dakota Combo. Festival founder and director Steve Heckler will do his level best to fill the rest of St. Paul with live jazz, from the stage at TPT to nearby clubs, bars and studio venues.
Here’s a look at the headliners.
Hometown-vocalist-turned-international-star José James will bring his latest Blue Note project: “José James Celebrates Bill Withers.” This is not a standard tribute show by any stretch of the imagination. It’s James honoring a living artist he cares about deeply by singing his songs – “Lean on Me,” “Use Me,” “Just the Two of Us” – in his own way. James is a compelling and charismatic performer. We’ve seen this show (or variations) twice and will gladly see it again.
North Carolina-based vocalist Nnenna Freelon is a six-time Grammy nominee and a class act. She’s made a dozen critically acclaimed recordings (she’s on the Concord label) and has graced the Dakota’s stage several times over the years. Side note: her husband, Phil Freelon, designed the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., among other major museum projects. Power couple!
Alto saxophonist and singer Grace Kelly made her first recording when she was 12 years old. While still a teen, she co-led sessions with the formidable Lee Konitz and Phil Woods. Now 26, she’s made a dozen albums, appears regularly in Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” house band, writes for film and TV and is infusing her version of jazz with pop, funk and electronics.
When Detroit-born reedman James Carter comes to town, he never fails to acknowledge his former teacher, Twin Cities-based saxophonist Donald Washington. Carter’s first working quartet included Golden Valley’s Craig Taborn on keys; Taborn has since gone on to his own big things. With 20 albums to his credit, including Roberto Sierra’s “Concerto for Saxophones and Orchestra,” the versatile, powerful Carter will be here with his organ trio including Gerald Gibbs on the B-3 and Leonard King Jr. on drums.
Also: Israeli percussionist and pianist Yogev Shetrit will bring his trio and their unique sound: contemporary jazz and hard bop flavored by Middle Eastern and North African influences. Cuban singer Mayito Rivera will make a rare North American appearance with Twin cities-based Charanga Tropical. Havana native and pianist Jorge Luis Pacheco will perform his own blend of traditional Cuban music and forward-thinking Cuban jazz. Following a stellar performance at last year’s Jazz Fest, New Orleans clarinetist and vocalist Aurora Nealand will return with pianist Tom McDermott.
The whole lineup and more details will be released in May. The festival is free, but VIP tickets will be available.
And the Minnesota Book Awards go to …
At the 2019 Minnesota Book Awards, held Saturday at St. Paul’s InterContinental Hotel for an audience of more than 800 book lovers and sponsors, Wing Young Huie won the Memoir & Creative Nonfiction award for “Chinese-Ness: The Meanings of Identity and the Nature of Belonging,” published by Minnesota Historical Society Press.
Cori Doerrfeld won the Children’s Literature award for “The Rabbit Listened,” published by Dial Books for Young Readers. Maya Dusenbery took the General Nonfiction category for “Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick,” a HarperOne/HarperCollins title. Brian Freeman won Genre Fiction for “The Voice Inside,” published by Thomas & Mercer.
The award in Middle Grade Literature went to Pat Schmatz for “The Key to Every Thing,” a Candlewick Press book. Susan Bartlett Foote won the Minnesota Nonfiction category for “The Crusade for Forgotten Souls: Reforming Minnesota’s Mental Institutions, 1946-1954,” out from the University of Minnesota Press. Sarah Stonich’s “Laurentian Divide: A Novel,” the sequel to her popular “Vacationland,” also published by the University of Minnesota Press, won the Novel & Short Story award.
Chaun Webster ’s debut collection “GeNtry!fication: or the scene of the crime,” published by Noemi Press, won the Poetry category. And the award for Young Adult Literature went to Shannon Gibney for “Dream Country,” published by Dutton Books for Young Readers.
Two previously announced special awards were presented at the ceremony. The Book Artist Award went to Jody Williams for her intriguing “For Now,” a combination book, box and puzzle exploring the number four. David Mura received his Kay Sexton Award.
Most of this year’s Minnesota Book Award winners, chosen from a field of more than 220 entries, were first-timers, and all faced stiff competition. Among the other finalists were Kate DiCamillo, Kelly Barnhill and Patricia Hampl. The Book Awards is a program of the Friends of the Saint Paul Public Library, the Library of Congress’s designated Minnesota Center for the Book.
The picks
This week is your last chance to see “Egypt’s Sunken Cities” at Mia . It’s an eye-opening, mind-blowing collection of enormous statues and small ritual objects discovered in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Alexandria, undisturbed for centuries until they were found by underwater archaeologist Frank Goddio and his team. We wrote a things-to-know-before-you-go piece after it opened last November. Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt’s Supreme Council for Antiquities, was here for the reveal; we’ve since seen his name in the press countless times in articles about new discoveries made in Egypt. Which are still being made with astonishing frequency. (Recently, Waziri announced a find of mummified cats and scarab beetles. Beetle mummies!) Closes Sunday, April 14, for real.
Tonight (Tuesday, April 9, 2019) at the Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival: “Ensemble.” Documentary filmmaker Jean-Nicolos Orhon spent a year with the Montreal Metropolitan Symphony as they prepared for their first international tour. His film is a look at rehearsals, the musicians’ everyday lives and the role of their maestro, Yannet Nézet-Séguin. 7:05 p.m. Also tomorrow (Wednesday) at 4:40 p.m. and next Wednesday (April 17) at 4:40 p.m. FMI including trailer, times and tickets ($15/11/8).
Wednesday in the Walker Cinema: Claudia Rankine: “Notes on ‘The White Card.’” Award-winning poet, Yale professor and MacArthur fellow Rankine will discuss her new play, “The White Card,” an uncompromising look at race, privilege and the invisibility of whiteness. The play was published in March by Graywolf, which earlier published Rankine’s multiple-award-winning “Citizen: An American Lyric.” Rankine’s appearance is part of the old/new Mack Lecture Series supported by Aaron and Carol Mack – old because the Macks have been sponsoring one-off lectures for years, new because the lectures are now being programmed as a series, which means we’re less likely to miss them. The series launched last week with New York Times foreign correspondent and Isis expert Rukmini Callimachi. Which was, in a word, incredible. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25/20/12).
Thursday through Sunday at the Ted Mann: University Opera Theatre presents Four Acts from Grand Opera. On the heels of Menotti’s “The Consul,” a collaboration with Arbeit Opera Theatre in March, the students of the University Opera Theatre will perform Act III of Puccini’s “La Bohème,” Act III of Verdi’s “La Traviata,” the dungeon scene from Act II of Beethoven’s “Fidelio” and a suite from Richard Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier.” Jeffrey Madison will direct, Mark Russell Smith will conduct. Two casts will perform. 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 1:30 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($25/15/5). (BTW “La Traviata” is Minnesota Opera’s next production, opening Saturday, May 4.)
Friday at Orchestra Hall: Jazz in the Target Atrium: “Another One: Myra Melford Solo Piano.” The extraordinary pianist hardly ever comes through the Twin Cities. Her last time here (to the best of our knowledge) was at the Walker in 2006. Curated by Jeremy Walker since 2014, “Jazz in the Target Atrium” will not return in the just-announced 2019-20 season. So this will be the final concert of the series, and what a way to go. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($32).

Republican releases transcript of top FBI lawyer during Clinton, Trump-Russia investigations

Texto completo: Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., released the transcript of former FBI General Counsel James Baker on Tuesday, the latest in a series of such disclosures by the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee.

The 152-page transcript is from a closed-door interview that Baker gave on Oct. 3, 2018 in front of a joint session of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees.

“The Americans deserve transparency and they deserve to know what transpired at the highest levels of the FBI and at the origin of the probe into President Trump’s campaign," Collins said.

Baker was the FBI's top lawyer from 2014 to 2018, and he held that key role during two high-profile investigations — the Clinton investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation.

The FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email server and her mishandling of classified information, dubbed Midyear Exam, ended with no charges ultimately being filed. During his testimony, Baker described Clinton’s behavior as “alarming” and “appalling." Baker said he “argued with others about why they thought she shouldn’t be charged” although he ultimately agreed with the decision not to charge her.

Baker also admitted that, upon seeing some of the texts exchanged between FBI special agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, he was “quite alarmed” and “concerned about is whether any decisions had been taken — or not taken — in the Midyear case that were driven by political bias of any sort.”

The FBI’s investigation of Russian interference and its possible ties to Trump or Trump associates, dubbed Crossfire Hurricane, would eventually carry over into special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation which ended in March with no charges of criminal collusion. Baker admitted he was “concerned” about the investigation, saying it was “novel” and “highly unusual.”

Baker further testified that in 2016 he met with Michael Sussmann, a lawyer from Perkins Coie, who gave him unspecified information from “cyber experts” not related to the dossier but still related to the Trump-Russia investigation. Perkins Coie was the law firm hired by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election. It’s the same firm that hired Fusion GPS, which then in turn hired ex-British spy Christopher Steele, whose infamous memos were used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications against at least one Trump associate.

When asked if an outside counsel had ever before tried to pass along information to him as general counsel for the purposes of then passing along to the FBI, Baker said, “That’s the only one I can remember.” Baker said he passed Sussman’s information to either Strzok or former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Bill Priestap. He said Sussman told him that he’d given the information to the New York Times as well.

Beyond his contacts with Perkins Coie, Baker also admitted talking with at least one journalist about these issues in 2016, testifying that he repeatedly spoke with David Corn, whom he called a “long-time friend.” Corn is a journalist at Mother Jones who wrote an article titled “A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump” on Oct. 31, 2016 — just days before the 2016 presidential election.

Baker said “David had part of what is now referred to as the Steele dossier and he talked to me about that and wanted to provide that to the FBI.” Baker said Corn passed along a portion of the dossier to Baker, who, just as he did with Sussman’s info, then handed it over to Priestap.

Baker said he reviewed the "probably cause" portion of the FISA application against Carter Page. He said he didn’t usually get involved with the FISA approval process, but that he “wanted to make sure that we were filing something that would adhere to the law and stand up over time.”

In his testimony, Baker also revealed that, at a meeting in the wake of the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Page and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe both told him that they took Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s suggestion that he “wear a wire” to record conversations with President Trump seriously. Rosenstein has denied this account, while sources told NBC News that he was only joking about secretly recording the president.

While speaking on the floor of the House announcing the release of this transcript on Tuesday, Collins made it clear that he “will continue to work to release as many transcripts as possible, including the entirety of Mr. Baker’s interview with the Judiciary Committee. The American people deserve the truth.”

In recent weeks, Collins has released transcripts of the congressional interviews of Strzok, Page, Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, his wife and Fusion GPS contractor Nellie Ohr, former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, and former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Bill Priestap.

Anxious Wait in Mexico For Migrants Who Hope U.S. Can Be Safe Haven

Texto completo: TIJUANA, Mexico -- Hoping to convince American immigration officials that his life is in danger, Selvin Alvarado sorted through photographs of men who he said have threatened to kill him.
Mr. Alvarado said he fled Honduras last fall after exposing corruption in his hometown and was followed into Mexico by an armed group. Once he reached the United States, he believed he would be safe -- even if that meant being detained while waiting for asylum.
"I prefer 1,000 times being jailed," he said last week at a shelter south of the United States border, "than being dead."
Instead, as part of a newly expanded Trump administration policy, Mr. Alvarado, 29, a father of two, was sent back to Mexico. He has been waiting for weeks to be summoned for an asylum hearing in California.
Hundreds of asylum seekers are expected to be blocked from waiting in the United States each day under the so-called Remain in Mexico policy, which American officials describe as a deterrent to illegal immigration.
Officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the policy also aims to ease overcrowded detention facilities as they grapple with a recent surge in migrants along the southwestern border. The policy is being challenged in federal court.
"The crisis at our border is worsening, and D.H.S. will do everything in its power to end it," Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said this week.
[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]
On Thursday, an official from Mexico's Foreign Ministry said it was unclear how many asylum seekers might be turned away from the United States under the policy, which he said the Trump administration had expanded without its consultation. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a delicate diplomatic issue.
About 633 Central American asylum seekers have been turned away since January, unable to prove sufficient fear of being tortured and persecuted in Mexico. It is a shift from earlier guidelines, which allowed migrants who convinced the authorities that they had a credible fear of returning to their home nations to remain in the United States while their asylum cases were being considered.
Stories of fleeing violence, extortion and corruption in their home countries do not meet the new standard for entry. Many migrants are also unable to obtain lawyers to represent them in court without first meeting them in the United States.
Mr. Alvarado said he was considering sneaking into the United States if his asylum claim was further delayed.
"I'll have to do it illegally," Mr. Alvarado said, holding photographs of the men who he said pursued him from Honduras, through Guatemala and into Tapachula, Mexico. "I'll have to give up everything."
For the most part, the policy has been rolled out slowly and quietly.
When it began at the San Ysidro port of entry in California in late January, only men traveling by themselves from Central America were told to wait in Mexico as their asylum cases wound through the American legal system. The policy has since expanded to stop entire families from waiting in the United States, although unaccompanied children and Mexican citizens will be allowed to enter.
It is now being enforced at border ports at Calexico, Calif., where President Trump traveled on Friday to tour the border, and El Paso. Ms. Nielsen has directed her department to expand the policy to other legal crossing points from Mexico.
The number of border crossings are nowhere as high as in the early 2000s, when as many as 220,000 migrants crossed the border in a month. Ms. Nielsen estimated last month that border officials had stopped as many as 100,000 migrants in March, up from 76,000 in February.
A State Department report released last month acknowledged the possibility that the migrants were no safer in Mexico from the same gangs that threatened them in Central America than they had been at home.
That is constantly on the mind of Daniel Nuñez, who was working as a security guard in Honduras when gang members opened fire in October, severely injuring several of his colleagues.
Mr. Nuñez fled to the United States border, where he asked for asylum in Calexico, but he was recently sent back to the Mexican city of Mexicali to wait for his immigration hearing.
The closest American immigration court is 30 minutes away. But Mr. Nuñez was told he had to report for his hearing at the San Ysidro port, a nearly three-hour drive.
He has no car, is sleeping in a shelter with about 370 other people and is trying to figure out how to get to San Ysidro. "I was thinking about that," he said last week, scratching his head. "How I was going to manage."
In a lawsuit filed in February in federal court in San Francisco, the American Civil Liberties Union accused the government of violating immigration law by returning asylum seekers to Mexico. The Trump administration has maintained it has broad discretion over removal proceedings.
Jacqueline Brown Scott, a lawyer, represents one of the plaintiffs in the case, who is identified in court papers only as Howard Doe for protection. He claims to have fled a drug cartel in Honduras, only to be kidnapped by another cartel in Mexico. He escaped after 15 days and he went to the United States border to seek asylum.
Immigration authorities diverted him to Tijuana. Last week, he appeared in immigration court in San Diego, where Ms. Scott argued that he had a fear of persecution in Mexico. He was sent back again.
"I told them everything, but they didn't seem to care," the migrant said in a text message that was viewed by The New York Times, which is withholding his name for security concerns.
Some migrants face additional delays from immigration judges who insist they find legal counsel before their cases can move forward.
Denis Rostran, of Honduras, said he called 10 lawyers who were listed on a document that Department of Homeland Security officials gave to him when he was sent back to Tijuana. None answered. Mr. Rostran said he has slept some nights on the street and has been robbed twice.
A Department of Homeland Security official said it was committed to ensuring migrants have legal assistance at no cost to the government. The agency also is not forcing migrants to return to Mexico who would "more likely than not" be persecuted or tortured there, the official said.
Twenty shelters and churches in Tijuana are housing around 3,000 migrants -- and have almost reached their limit, said Esmeralda Siu, the executive coordinator of the Migrant Defense Coalition, in the Mexican state of Baja California. Many of the migrants are awaiting their court dates, she said, and do not expect to leave soon.
That means that newly arrived and future migrants will have few, if any, options for shelter.
"There's no city, no state, that has sufficient resources to prepare for this," said Gustavo Magallanes Cortés, the director of migration affairs for Baja California. "They've allowed these people to return, but cut the resources for migrants, which has led to chaos. Every day a shelter calls me and says, 'I've run out of food."'
But many of the waiting migrants are determined to keep hope.
"Many people say they're doing this just so we get tired and give up on our cases," said Daniela Diaz, 19, who said she left El Salvador after a member of the MS-13 gang threatened to rape and kill her. She has been living in a shelter in Tijuana since late January.
She is frustrated that following the rules and asking for asylum at a legal port of entry -- instead of sneaking into the United States -- have resulted in a system of immigration purgatory.
"There's a lot of people throwing themselves over the wall," Ms. Diaz said, "and we're doing this the fair way."

The Mueller 'Coverup' Gambit

Texto completo: The only surprising thing about the new "coverup" accusation against Attorney General William Barr is that it took it two weeks to get there. The question is whether Republicans fall for this naked effort to revive the collusion-and-obstruction narrative.
Democrats and the media are still smarting over special counsel Robert Mueller's no-collusion findings, but their "coverup" fallback has its advantages. They can claim Mr. Barr's four-page summary of the report is a sham, that he's hiding the real truth. That's nonsense, but it allows them to continue stoking Trump-Russia collusion fantasies.
It also aids the Democrats in their larger goal: getting their hands on a fully unredacted report, along with its underlying documentation, before the public can see it. That way, they could plumb the voluminous documentation for more wild allegations and personal smears -- and leak away.
The "coverup" claim is only one of the levers Democrats are pulling, aided by friendly scribes at the New York Times and Washington Post, who published stories Thursday claiming anonymous members of the Mueller team are dissatisfied with the Barr summary. The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday also authorized subpoenas for an unredacted report and documents. And Democrats everywhere are accusing Republicans of hypocrisy. How dare Republicans spend two years demanding documents from the Justice Department about the Federal Bureau of Investigation's behavior in 2016, but now accept a redacted report?
Some Republicans will be tempted to capitulate. Mr. Barr up to now has said he would release as much as he can within the law and departmental regulations. That means redacting from the report information pertaining to grand-jury proceedings, continuing investigations, sources and methods. He's also removing details that might hurt the "reputational" interest of "peripheral" figures. This is proper -- not radical or sneaky. But Republicans worry that they will never put to rest the collusion-obstruction claims until they give Democrats everything.
Memo: Even if they get everything, the Democrats will never put those claims to rest. The left is too invested. But Republicans could make matters worse -- by handing Democrats the full Mueller monty, including thousands of pages of investigative material and grand-jury transcripts. Partisans will cherry-pick and leak every uncorroborated claim to fan the collusion-and-obstruction flames. They'll mine the documents for nuggets they can turn into yet new scandals. The New York Times may have to boost its staff to keep up.
More important than the practical consequences of going along with the Democrats is the principle of standing firm. "Transparency" is one of those feel-good words that lead to sloppy thinking. Who doesn't want more government transparency? Most people, when they think about it. Who wants generals posting attack plans online? Who wants President Trump tweeting out the nuclear codes?
More important, who wants the federal government spreading unfounded or uncorroborated accusations? Grand-jury and special-counsel investigations represent government power at its biggest and scariest. They can compel witnesses to reveal all manner of intimate details -- banking records, personal text messages, loan defaults, medical information. The proceedings are kept secret to encourage candor -- and candor also results in witnesses with grudges, speculation and even false testimony. Those swept up in probes like Mr. Mueller's are often private citizens, innocent of any wrongdoing.
If the process yields no indictments, the proceedings normally go into a black hole. That's because the government has no business spreading allegations or dirt from a case it is unwilling or unable to take to court. It's why former FBI Director James Comey's public trashing of Hillary Clinton was wrong (as Democrats fully understood in that context). And it's why federal law prohibits public disclosure of grand-jury proceedings, and severely restricts those who are ever allowed access -- and does not include members of Congress.
That's also why Democratic demands for "transparency" are radical, unlike the Republican quest to obtain Justice Department records about the FBI. The GOP has focused its informational demands squarely on the work product of federal officials who stand accused of abusing federal laws. That is called oversight. Republicans have also acknowledged the importance of safeguarding classified information. Yes, they've complained about excessive or improper blackouts. But they have never disputed the executive branch's authority to keep certain things secret.
The same should apply here. The point of the Mueller investigation was to provide clarity -- so it can't be treated with the same secrecy as most Justice Department investigations. That's why Mr. Barr has promised to disclose whatever he can. But he's right to insist on basic safeguards, and to release as much as possible to everyone all at once. It would be wrong to hand an elite group of political partisans a different version, which they would distort and wield as a weapon.

Those swept up in probes like Mr. Mueller's are often private citizens, innocent of any wrongdoing.
If the process yields no indictments, the proceedings normally go into a black hole. That's because the government has no business spreading allegations or dirt from a case it is unwilling or unable to take to court. It's why former FBI Director James Comey's public trashing of Hillary Clinton was wrong (as Democrats fully understood in that context). And it's why federal law prohibits public disclosure of grand-jury proceedings, and severely restricts those who are ever allowed access—and does not include members of Congress.
That's also why Democratic demands for "transparency" are radical, unlike the Republican quest to obtain Justice Department records about the FBI. The GOP has focused its informational demands squarely on the work product of federal officials who stand accused of abusing federal laws. That is called oversight. Republicans have also acknowledged the importance of safeguarding classified information. Yes, they've complained about excessive or improper blackouts. But they have never disputed the executive branch's authority to keep certain things secret.
The same should apply here. The point of the Mueller investigation was to provide clarity—so it can't be treated with the same secrecy as most Justice Department investigations. That's why Mr. Barr has promised to disclose whatever he can. But he's right to insist on basic safeguards, and to release as much as possible to everyone all at once. It would be wrong to hand an elite group of political partisans a different version, which they would distort and wield as a weapon.

Texto completo: Surely musical theater is last on the list of mediums suited to agitprop. At its best, it is too complex, too cosmopolitan and too pleasure-seeking to pass loyalty tests. What goes into the machinery as revolutionary rage comes out as "Les Miz."
And yet there's "The Cradle Will Rock," Marc Blitzstein's Brechtian "play in music" about unionizing the steel industry. Audiences at its fabled premiere in 1937 would have understood it without footnotes as a leftist rallying cry and a satire of unfettered capitalism's enablers. Writing in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called it "a triumph of politically insurgent theater."
But what is it now?
John Doyle's revival, which opened on Wednesday at Classic Stage Company, is too wan to answer the question. Though his stripped-down approach often enhances richly conceived works -- his production of "Carmen Jones" last year was gorgeous -- it makes others, severe to begin with, seem cold and underfed.
The tension between minimalism and maximalism is central to "The Cradle Will Rock" in both style and story. It is not, dramatically, a subtle work; even the characters' names are placards. In Steeltown, U.S.A., unionists led by Larry Foreman (Tony Yazbeck) try to organize impoverished workers. Determined to squash them is Mr. Mister (David Garrison), who owns everything and everyone.
His cronies and apologists include such allegorical types as Reverend Salvation and Editor Daily, whom 1937 audiences would have recognized as cartoon versions of Billy Sunday and William Randolph Hearst. When they and other members of Mr. Mister's "liberty committee" get rounded up in a police sweep by accident, they find themselves in night court, sharing benches with agitators and undesirables.
That's the simple frame for Blitzstein's libretto, which alternates between scenes in the courtroom and the detainees' back stories.
These come in two varieties. The cronies are featured in ham-handed vignettes of co-optation, each featuring Mr. Mister or his wife, Mrs. Mister (Sally Ann Triplett), blackmailing them into compliance. As a result, Reverend Salvation (Benjamin Eakeley) tailors his sermons to match each year's political imperative and Editor Daily (Ken Barnett) creates "news to order," much of it fake.
[What's new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter]
A problem with this kind of satire is that once the pattern is established you know exactly how it will play out. President Prexy of the local university; Dr. Specialist, whose diagnoses can be bought; two lap dog artistes, Yasha and Dauber; even Junior and Sister Mister, both idlers -- all do as they're told once the cash spigot opens.
But the tone shifts radically whenever the focus is on capitalism's victims, especially the ruined Harry Druggist (Mr. Yazbeck again) and the streetwalking Moll (Lara Pulver). Here Blitzstein gives us social realism, purple with sympathy and a plethora of ain'ts.
What makes it all bearable, and can sometimes make it beautiful, is the score, in which pastiche passages that mock the bad guys alternate with jagged, yearning arias that ennoble the others. (If it sounds like Leonard Bernstein, that's because Bernstein was a Blitzstein protégé.) In both modes, the music is more expressive than the lyrics, which seem to have been written for a pamphlet.
The show's history feeds into these contradictions. Whether because of budget cuts or censorship, "The Cradle Will Rock" was canceled by its sponsor, the Federal Theater Project, on the day of its planned premiere.
With the intended theater (and sets and costumes) locked down, the director, Orson Welles, then 22, decided to rent a space 19 blocks north. The audience paraded to the new site but, in an irony more pungent than any of Blitzstein's, the actors' and musicians' unions forbade their members to perform under the terms of their existing contracts.
So Welles invited the actors to buy tickets and sing their roles, in street clothes, from their seats. On the otherwise empty stage, Blitzstein accompanied them at an upright piano, forgoing his 23-player orchestration.
That jury-rigged solution became the bare-bones template for most future productions. Classic Stage uses the piano reduction, played tag-team-style by four cast members. It cuts the company to 10 actors from 30, which can get confusing as most play multiple roles. Though there is a set, designed by Mr. Doyle, it is hardly more elaborate than the one at the premiere. Nor are Ann Hould-Ward's costumes any showier: She dresses everyone, even the elites, in dirty work clothes, as if to underline the labor of the actors themselves.
The simplicity that has felt clarifying in Mr. Doyle's best work feels stingy here. The piano accompaniment strips "The Cradle Will Rock" of much of its sostenuto beauty; what's left is further eroded by singing that sometimes grates the ears. The staging, in one 90-minute act, is largely static and, where musical theater razzmatazz is called for, totally underwhelming. Too much of the acting seems deliberately wooden.
But 60 minutes in, just as you begin to fear that denying pleasure has become a point of pride, the production coalesces. Ms. Pulver offers a lovely version of the proletariat blues "Nickel Under the Foot." The sulfurous title song, predicting the imminent downfall of the kleptocracy, gets a rousing rendition from Mr. Yazbeck. And Rema Webb, as a woman whose machinist husband, injured at the plant, has been smeared as a drunk, sells her furious 11 o'clock number ("Joe Worker") for all it's worth.
In these moments you begin to feel the tension between propaganda and entertainment as Blitzstein evidently intended. It's only a start, but I'm not sure any production could manage the contradictions much better. The 2013 Encores! Off-Center version used a 13-piece orchestration but was barely staged. Opera house outings provide the full musical thrills at the expense of immediacy. Opera Saratoga's live recording, conducted by John Mauceri, may get closest to a satisfying compromise.
But the revolution wasn't supposed to be narrowcast. Maybe what "The Cradle Will Rock" needs so it can be heard anew is new technology -- or new radicals. That can probably be arranged.

Liberals Are Eating Their Own

Texto completo: "For me," former ESPN vice president Roxanne Jones wrote on CNN's website this week, "Biden, as chair of that all-white-male Senate committee -- intentionally, or not -- helped to uphold the misogynistic culture that would ultimately allow Donald Trump to win the presidency. Then there's Biden's mass incarceration problem."
Maybe Joe Biden really has overstayed his welcome.
In simpler political times, the litmus test for being an acceptable Democrat was support for Roe v. Wade. The one certain thing we have learned about the politics of the modern Democratic Party is that if you are accused of having done, said or written anything that violates an array of recently identified progressive values, you are disqualified from public life. You will be denounced and shunned.
Last week, to atone for chairing the Clarence Thomas hearings nearly three decades ago, Mr. Biden prostrated himself before his progressive accusers and said "the white man's culture" has "got to change."
A week later, Mr. Biden became trapped in the spider web of gender politics. Days have been spent debating whether his public squeezing habits should disqualify him from the presidency. To confess his sins, he posted a video on Twitter.
A few months ago, liberals were about to decapitate their government leadership in Virginia for racial and sexual violations. As described by the enforcers at the New York Times, "Democrats moved swiftly to send a zero-tolerance message."
House Democrats couldn't agree on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism until it also addressed "Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry." Check, check, check.
Students at George Washington University this week voted on a proposition that the school's nickname, the Colonials, "has too deep a connection to colonization and glorifies the act of systemic oppression." Some 54% of the student body agreed. The GW mascot is, at least for now, still George Washington.
People wonder how it got this crazy. Somewhere along the line, what began as decent ideas, such as respect for differences, degraded into political weaponry and cultural paranoia -- seeing offense where none existed.
Liberal and progressive professors have been driven from classrooms and made to apologize for imagined offenses against the new orthodoxies, such as reading from the works of James Baldwin and thereby saying the N-word out loud in class. Forbidden.
Disputes over Halloween costumes, which began on campuses, have migrated to households, where mothers struggle with whether their child's costume will be criticized for cultural appropriation.
Today in politics, universities, the media and corporations, people are routinely told to conform or get out for violating ideas that lack logic, reason or proportion.
How did this happen? It has become increasingly clear that one of the primary reasons for this descent into irrationality and chaos was the virtual elimination of conservative professors from higher education. It may be true that most academics are by instinct liberal, but conservatives were their speed bump. With them gone, it has been a race to the intellectual bottom.
Free speech is important to productive inquiry. As important is the related tradition of intellectual challenge. Any serious academic exposes his ideas to colleagues who know -- or knew -- it is their responsibility to weed out weakness and illogic. Excepting the ignored mad geniuses, the system has worked for centuries. Discovering and testing ideas is why smart people used to go into academia.
Liberal professors could have protected this tradition of intellectual rigor, but they didn't. They let it erode. Ideas that would have stayed in the faculty lounge as thoughts swiftly rose to orthodoxy.
The left -- being the left -- saw an opening and transformed vague ideas into instruments of power. Notions such as "systemic" and "unwelcoming" mean whatever they need to mean. They have turned ideas into useful idiots.
An exhibition of this decline is on view right now at Villanova University. Last weekend, these pages published an article by Profs. Colleen Sheehan and James Wilson, criticizing the university for adding "diversity and inclusion" issues to its teacher-evaluation questionnaire. The form asks, for instance, whether a teacher has created an "atmosphere free of bias based on individual differences or social identities." Ms. Sheehan and Mr. Wilson called such phrases an "ominous catchall."
It was a serious, respectful statement of disagreement. Within days, a faculty petition of pushback appeared with nearly 100 colleagues' signatures. It states: "We believe that ensuring that students have an educational environment free of racism, sexism, anti-LGBTQ sentiments, ableism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of discrimination is essential to providing students with a liberal arts education."
Villanova should have thanked Profs. Sheehan and Wilson. Instead, on instinct, it has ring-fenced their opinions.
Maybe Joe Biden will survive his trial by progressive ordeal. But there will be more Bidens. Liberals drove conservative ideas out of academia, politics, the culture and the media. What's left of liberalism is now consuming its own.

Elon Musk’s compensation at least 40,000 times more than median Tesla worker

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Today in politics, universities, the media and corporations, people are routinely told to conform or get out for violating ideas that lack logic, reason or proportion.
How did this happen? It has become increasingly clear that one of the primary reasons for this descent into irrationality and chaos was the virtual elimination of conservative professors from higher education. It may be true that most academics are by instinct liberal, but conservatives were their speed bump. With them gone, it has been a race to the intellectual bottom.
Free speech is important to productive inquiry. As important is the related tradition of intellectual challenge. Any serious academic exposes his ideas to colleagues who know—or knew—it is their responsibility to weed out weakness and illogic. Excepting the ignored mad geniuses, the system has worked for centuries. Discovering and testing ideas is why smart people used to go into academia.
Liberal professors could have protected this tradition of intellectual rigor, but they didn't. They let it erode. Ideas that would have stayed in the faculty lounge as thoughts swiftly rose to orthodoxy.
The left—being the left—saw an opening and transformed vague ideas into instruments of power. Notions such as "systemic" and "unwelcoming" mean whatever they need to mean. They have turned ideas into useful idiots.
An exhibition of this decline is on view right now at Villanova University. Last weekend, these pages published an article by Profs. Colleen Sheehan and James Wilson, criticizing the university for adding "diversity and inclusion" issues to its teacher-evaluation questionnaire. The form asks, for instance, whether a teacher has created an "atmosphere free of bias based on individual differences or social identities." Ms. Sheehan and Mr. Wilson called such phrases an "ominous catchall."
It was a serious, respectful statement of disagreement. Within days, a faculty petition of pushback appeared with nearly 100 colleagues' signatures. It states: "We believe that ensuring that students have an educational environment free of racism, sexism, anti-LGBTQ sentiments, ableism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of discrimination is essential to providing students with a liberal arts education."
Villanova should have thanked Profs. Sheehan and Wilson. Instead, on instinct, it has ring-fenced their opinions.
Maybe Joe Biden will survive his trial by progressive ordeal. But there will be more Bidens. Liberals drove conservative ideas out of academia, politics, the culture and the media. What's left of liberalism is now consuming its own.

Texto completo: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana has impressed the political world by reporting that his presidential exploratory committee raised more than $7 million in the first quarter of 2019. The 37-year-old Democrat isn't yet in a financial league with his boyhood idol Sen. Bernie Sanders, who raked in more than $18 million. But one of the media's favorite candidates is showing that he can win over Democratic donors, too.
Mr. Buttigieg's genial tone is very different from that of the hectoring Mr. Sanders. And unlike the Vermont socialist, the South Bend mayor seems open to working with people who don't share his views.
While Mr. Sanders first generated attention as the Marxist mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Mr. Buttigieg has carved out a niche as the midwestern mayor most admired by coastal leftists. In 2014 the Washington Post called him the "most interesting mayor you've never heard of."
Two years later, a New York Times column about Mr. Buttigieg carried the headline: "The First Gay President?" The column began:
South Bend, Ind. — IF you went into some laboratory to concoct a perfect Democratic candidate, you'd be hard pressed to improve on Pete Buttigieg, the 34-year-old second-term mayor of this Rust Belt city, where he grew up and now lives just two blocks from his parents.
But you still might be hard-pressed to make the case for electing Mr. Buttigieg President. Hong Zhuang, economics professor at Indiana University South Bend, writes in the Indiana Business Review that the South Bend area is doing well, but not quite as well as a community nearby:
The South Bend-Mishawaka Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in 2018 experienced some economic growth, lower unemployment rates, a minor increase in the wage rate and a more prosperous housing market. The Elkhart-Goshen MSA in 2018 demonstrated stunning growth in aggregate production and job creation. The unemployment rate remained steadily low, and income grew moderately in 2018.
It seems that Mayor Pete Buttigieg's South Bend is not bad, but it's nobody's Elkhart. Ms. Zhuang elaborates:
The combined economy of the South Bend-Mishawaka and Elkhart-Goshen MSAs had a very strong year of growth in 2017 with total real metropolitan gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding 2016 by $1.6 billion, a rise of 6.3 percent. The majority of this regional growth came from Elkhart-Goshen, which added $1.5 billion in its real GDP, a magical rate of 11.3 percent output growth. Real GDP in the South Bend-Mishawaka MSA only expanded by $71 million, a 0.6 percent increase from 2016. Moreover, compared with real GDP in 2007, aggregate production in South Bend-Mishawaka was still $269 million below its pre-recession peak.
There seems to be a trend here. Even though the Elkhart area's unemployment rate surged much higher than that of the South Bend area in the wake of the financial crisis, Elkhart has recently enjoyed a lower jobless rate.
If he wasn't such a charismatic millennial, Mr. Buttigieg might have trouble running for President as a key figure in the second best local economy in the north central portion of his state.
Even now, the Buttigieg campaign faces the risk that voters will demand nothing less than the best government official in his region. But any Democrats wondering if perhaps fast-growing Elkhart also has a charismatic millennial for them to consider are bound to be disappointed. While Elkhart has been producing lots of jobs, it does not seem to have produced any charming politicians of late.
So Mr. Buttigieg remains the only game in town for primary voters determined to nominate a small-city mayor with a middling record to be the next President of the United States.
And some people say the Democratic field is already too large!

U.S. News: White House Reversed Denied Clearances

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A Trump administration employee said the White House reversed rulings that denied security clearances for about two dozen officials and contractors, including two senior officials who are still working for the administration.
The release of the employee's interview by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform comes as Democrats step up their scrutiny of the clearance process, citing concerns about national security. In a letter to the White House, the panel also said it would authorize subpoenas seeking testimony from staff members involved in granting security clearances, including Carl Kline, the White House's former personnel security director.
The panel said that its staff members interviewed Tricia Newbold, a longtime career member of the White House security office. In the interview, Ms. Newbold told Democratic and Republican staff that she kept a list of about 25 rulings denying clearances that were subsequently overturned.
The panel didn't provide the names of the people affected by the clearance rulings, but Ms. Newbold said the list included two current senior White House officials, both of whom were flagged for having significant disqualifying factors, including foreign influence.
The New York Times and CNN have reported that President Trump pressured top aides to grant a security clearance to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, his son-in-law and daughter, against the aides' recommendations.
The White House didn't respond to a request to comment. Mr. Trump has denied involvement in Mr. Kushner's and any other officials security-clearance process. When Mr. Kushner received a top-secret clearance in May, his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said his client's application had been "properly submitted, reviewed by career officials, and went through the normal process."
Republicans on the oversight panel issued a lengthy memo about Ms. Newbold's statements, saying that she testified that only four or five of her unfavorable 25 adjudications were for "very serious reasons." They also said that Ms. Newbold, in her interview, said that the Trump administration had improved some aspects of the security clearance process.
In the interview, Ms. Newbold said clearance applications for White House officials "were not always adjudicated in the best interest of national security," adding that she wanted to "bring back the integrity of the office." She said she raised her concerns with Mr. Kline and other officials.
Ms. Newbold also told the committee that she has been retaliated against for raising objections at the White House, but decided to come forward to Congress because of national security concerns. In January 2018, Ms. Newbold, who has a rare form of dwarfism, alleged that Mr. Kline took steps to humiliate her by moving personnel security files out of her reach. The Department of Defense, where Mr. Kline now works, referred comment to the White House.
More than 100 political appointees in the White House, vice president's office and National Security Council typically seek security clearances.
The White House's security clearance protocols came under scrutiny last year after it emerged that former White House staff secretary Rob Porter had held an interim clearance for more than a year despite multiple allegations of abuse from two former wives, which he has denied.
Following Mr. Porter's ouster, then-chief of staff John Kelly sought to curtail access to classified information inside the White House, downgrading the interim clearances of several officials -- including Mr. Kushner.
Security clearances are typically handled by career officials, rather than political appointees. To begin that process, White House officials must submit a form called SF-86 that lists, among other matters, all of their foreign contacts within a certain time period. Mr. Kushner initially omitted any foreign contacts from the form, and later updated it at least three times to include what he has said were more than 100 contacts with more than 20 countries.
Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), the House panel's chairman, said in January he planned to look into how White House security clearances were issued. In a letter sent to White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Monday, Mr. Cummings wrote that the "White House has refused to produce a single piece of paper or a single requested witness."

Politico Considers Naming Editor to Succeed Harris

Texto completo: Politico is discussing a plan to install a new editor in chief to replace John Harris, who co-founded the political news outlet in 2007, according to people familiar with the matter.
Matthew Kaminski, currently Politico's global editor, would become the outlet's new top editor under the plan being discussed, the people said. Mr. Harris would remain at Politico in a leadership role.
The details of the leadership transition are still being weighed and plans could shift, one of the people said. Mr. Kaminski's specific title and responsibilities under the new plan couldn't be learned.
The editorial shuffle would mark the end of an era for Politico, where Mr. Harris has helped usher in a new form of up-to-the-second journalism on political matters big and small.
With his co-founder, Jim VandeHei, Mr. Harris has overseen a news organization that cultivated high-profile journalists, including Maggie Haberman, now at the New York Times; Ben Smith, now editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, and Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios. Mr. Allen was also a co-founder of Politico.
Mr. Harris, an alumnus of the Washington Post, created Politico with Mr. Vandehei and Robert Allbritton, who is its publisher. Mr. VandeHei left Politico in 2016 and eventually founded Axios, a digital news organization that covers politics, technology and business, among other topics.
Launched in 2007, Politico reshaped Washington coverage with its blanket reporting on all things political, rapid-fire blog posts, morning email blasts and in-depth tracking of elections and legislative happenings. That later paved the way for a move toward events and high-price subscription services.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The actress and writer Natasha Lyonne has an Emmy nomination, a Screen Actors Guild Award and two of the most critically beloved shows currently running: "Orange Is the New Black," the seventh season of which premieres this year; and "Russian Doll," Ms. Lyonne's own passion project, which she co-created and stars in.
Today, Ms. Lyonne can add another laurel to her C.V.: co-creator of a New York Times crossword puzzle.
It puts her in august company. "I always describe myself as a real Rachel Maddow, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Clinton type," she said in a phone interview last week, referring to three other prominent figures who have created crosswords in The Times's celebrity puzzle series. "That's sort of my crew, is the best way I would put it," she joked. "We do have a text chain, the four of us. They were constantly ridiculing me for not ever having constructed my own puzzle; this was the only way to keep up."
Ms. Lyonne has been a devoted Times crossword solver for about five years, ever since her boyfriend, Fred Armisen, got her hooked. To hear her tell it, it's become something of an obsession. "I feel a deep transparency about how true my love of the puzzle is; I feel very clean about it," she said. "I spend all of my time with the crossword, like an obscene amount of time. If you see me on set and you think I'm texting or something, I'm using the puzzle as a coping mechanism. It's a great joy in my life."
She's been open about her fandom on social media, tweeting with some frequency at The Times's Wordplay account. "I think, probably, most people who are interested in the crossword are too busy to tweet, because they're thinking big thoughts, they're changing the world," she said. "But me, I seem to have plenty of time to both do the puzzle and endlessly tweet and interface about the puzzle." She confesses, too, to "hoarding screengrabs" of favorite clues: "It's like my version of taking photos of scenery on vacation. I'm like, 'Look at this great clue! They found a way to get Lenny Bruce in the puzzle!"'
Clearly, Ms. Lyonne was a natural choice for the celebrity series, which began in 2017 as a way to celebrate the puzzle's 75th anniversary. The notable solvers Jesse Eisenberg, Isaac Mizrahi and Weird Al Yankovic have all contributed crosswords, too -- but, the Times puzzles editor Will Shortz said, "Natasha took this more seriously than almost anybody else."
Starting in January, Ms. Lyonne had a series of meetings with Deb Amlen, The Times's crossword columnist and a seasoned constructor herself. (Ms. Amlen's first-ever published crossword, in 2004, was a Sunday puzzle in The Times -- quite a feat.) Over the course of what Ms. Amlen estimates was 10 to 15 hours in person, plus many more texts, the pair agreed on a theme, brainstormed clue ideas and worked on filling in the puzzle.
Often, Ms. Amlen and Ms. Lyonne met at Ms. Lyonne's downtown Manhattan apartment, where her little white poodle Rootbeer kept them company and at least one piece of crossword-related ephemera serves as decoration: an across clue in the Nov. 29, 2018 puzzle, "Actress Lyonne of 'Orange Is the New Black,"' seven letters. (Ms. Lyonne "immediately" had it framed.)
Theirs was a fruitful partnership, driven by Ms. Lyonne's exuberance, Ms. Amlen's patient concentration and some amount of same-wavelength kismet. They both arrived at their first meeting with one of the same themes in mind, which they ended up using, and a shared interest in charitable work led them to donate part of their fees for the puzzle to the Lower Eastside Girls Club and the Women's Prison Association.
"Certain kinds of minds can, like, save the day in World War II," Ms. Lyonne said of Ms. Amlen. "Like 'The Karate Kid,' she had my full trust. I was like, 'I'm going to follow you out of this labyrinth. Blindfold me and let me follow."'
The result of Ms. Amlen's and Ms. Lyonne's hard work is a puzzle with "a lively feel to it," Mr. Shortz said, "which I like a lot."
When editing the celebrity puzzles, he said, he tends to use a "lighter touch" than with normal contributors, in order to allow their voices to shine through more. Take a clue in today's puzzle: "Poehler vortex of funniness," three letters. "That's not a clue I would normally allow, because it doesn't make sense," Mr. Shortz said. "But it's funny! It just makes me laugh, and it shows her personality."
Ms. Amlen said that in her pursuit of an authentic, all-in crossword-creating experience, Ms. Lyonne even went so far as to buy crossword-constructing software. Perhaps this won't be her last appearance on the puzzle page.
"I started to have this fantasy of getting significantly older, Agnès Varda old, and to be somebody who spends the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years really mastering a puzzle that I would be able to submit to The New York Times," Ms. Lyonne said. "Like, there's a puzzle."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A Trump administration employee said the White House reversed rulings that denied security clearances for about two dozen officials and contractors, including two senior officials who are still working for the administration.
The release of the employee's interview by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform comes as Democrats step up their scrutiny of the clearance process, citing concerns about national security. In a letter to the White House , the panel also said it would authorize subpoenas seeking testimony from staff members involved in granting security clearances, including Carl Kline, the White House's former personnel security director.
The panel said that its staff members interviewed Tricia Newbold, a longtime career member of the White House security office. In the interview, Ms. Newbold told Democratic and Republican staff that she kept a list of about 25 rulings denying clearances that were subsequently overturned.
The panel didn't provide the names of the people affected by the clearance rulings, but Ms. Newbold said the list included two current senior White House officials, both of whom were flagged for having significant disqualifying factors, including foreign influence. She said the 25 officials on her list had a "wide range of serious disqualifying issues," including foreign influence, conflicts of interest, drug use, financial problems and criminal conduct.
The New York Times and CNN have reported that President Trump pressured top aides to grant a security clearance to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, his son-in-law and daughter, against the aides' recommendations.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has denied involvement in Mr. Kushner's and any other official's security-clearance process. When Mr. Kushner received a top-secret clearance in May, his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said his client's application had been "properly submitted, reviewed by career officials, and went through the normal process."
Asked in an interview on Fox News about Ms. Newbold's comments, Mr. Kushner said: "Well, I can't comment for the White House's process. But what I can say is that over the last two years that I've been here, I've been accused of all different types of things, and all of those things have turned out to be false."
Republicans on the oversight panel issued a lengthy memo about Ms. Newbold's statements, saying that she testified that only four or five of her unfavorable 25 adjudications were for "very serious reasons." They also said that Ms. Newbold, in her interview, said that the Trump administration had improved some aspects of the security clearance process.
In the interview, Ms. Newbold said security-clearance applications for White House officials "were not always adjudicated in the best interest of national security," adding that she wanted to "bring back the integrity of the office." She said she raised her concerns with Mr. Kline and other officials.
Ms. Newbold also told the committee that she has been retaliated against for raising objections at the White House but decided to come forward to Congress because of national security concerns. In January 2018, Ms. Newbold, who has a rare form of dwarfism, alleged that Mr. Kline took steps to humiliate her by moving personnel security files out of her reach. The Department of Defense, where Mr. Kline now works, referred comment to the White House.
More than 100 political appointees in the White House, vice president's office and National Security Council typically seek security clearances.
The White House's security clearance protocols came under scrutiny last year after it emerged that former White House staff secretary Rob Porter had held an interim clearance for more than a year despite multiple allegations of abuse from two former wives, which he has denied.
Following Mr. Porter's ouster, then-chief of staff John Kelly sought to curtail access to classified information inside the White House, downgrading the interim clearances of several officials—including Mr. Kushner. The White House granted a permanent clearance to Mr. Kushner in May.
Mr. Kelly last year wrote a memo expressing concerns about granting a top-secret clearance to Mr. Kushner , according to a person familiar with the matter.
Security clearances are typically handled by career officials, rather than political appointees. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is tasked with conducting background checks into White House officials before they are granted permanent clearances. To begin that process, White House officials must submit a form called SF-86 that lists, among other matters, all of their foreign contacts within a certain time period. Mr. Kushner initially omitted any foreign contacts from the form, and later updated it at least three times to include what he has said were more than 100 contacts with more than 20 countries.
Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), the House panel's chairman, said in January that he planned to look into how White House security clearances were issued and made numerous requests to the Trump administration for information. In a letter sent to White House counsel Pat Cipollone on Monday, Mr. Cummings wrote that the "White House has refused to produce a single piece of paper or a single requested witness."
Mr. Cummings also requested that Mr. Cipollone release by April 5 the list that Ms. Newbold made, along with White House policy documents and clearance information for several current and former officials, including information on Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ms. Trump.
Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the oversight panel, criticized Democrats for providing short notice of Ms. Newbold's interview and said Mr. Cummings mischaracterized the information by releasing a summary of the interview and not a transcript. He said that one of the people on Ms. Newbold's list was a custodian for the General Services Administration.
"Chairman Cummings has departed from longstanding bipartisan oversight of the security clearance process to advance his partisan efforts to attack the president," Mr. Jordan said in a statement. "His unilateral decision to release cherry-picked excerpts from one witness so early into an investigation is far from the constructive oversight he promised."

Texto completo: Politico is discussing a plan to install a new editor in chief to replace John Harris, who co-founded the political news outlet in 2007, according to people familiar with the matter.
Matthew Kaminski, currently Politico's global editor, would become the outlet's new top editor under the plan being discussed, the people said. Mr. Harris would remain at Politico in a leadership role.
The details of the leadership transition are still being weighed and plans could shift, one of the people said. Mr. Kaminski's specific title and responsibilities under the new plan couldn't be learned.
The editorial shuffle would mark the end of an era for Politico, where Mr. Harris has helped usher in a new form of up-to-the-second journalism on political matters big and small.
With his co-founder, Jim VandeHei, Mr. Harris has overseen a news organization that cultivated high-profile journalists including Maggie Haberman, now at the New York Times, Ben Smith, now editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, and Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios. Mr. Allen was also a co-founder of Politico.
Mr. Harris, an alumnus of the Washington Post, created Politico with Mr. Vandehei and Robert Allbritton, who is currently its publisher. Mr. VandeHei left Politico in 2016 and eventually founded Axios, a digital news organization that covers politics, technology and business, among other topics.
Launched in 2007, Politico reshaped Washington coverage with its blanket reporting on all things political, rapid-fire blog posts, morning email blasts and in-depth tracking of elections and legislative happenings. That later paved the way for a move toward events and high-priced subscription services.
In recent years, Messrs. Harris and Allbritton have worked to refocus many of the site's initiatives and priorities following the 2016 management shake-up that resulted in Mr. VandeHei's departure.

Texto completo: We've all been waiting for a break from this cold, dreary winter. Well, for students — and their families — across the country, it's finally here: spring break! But as much as you've been pining for sunshine and a beach, spring break isn't an excuse to bust the budget or, worse, go into debt.
Your money goals shouldn't change based on the time of year. So, to help you save money, here's my list of best and worst things to do for spring break.
Best things to do for spring break Stay stateside. Driving is pretty much always the cheapest way to travel, so check out a destination within five or six hours of where you live. If you have to fly, you'll save money if you stay within the United States versus going to an overseas destination.
Visit southern beaches. I'm not just saying this because I'm from the South! Destinations like Daytona, Florida, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, are absolutely gorgeous. You can find hotel deals in both cities for around $75 per night.
Stay with friends. When I look back on my spring breaks, it's not the places I remember as much as the people I was with. Do you have a friend you haven't seen in a while who lives in a cool city that would be fun to visit? You'll both save money and make the most of your time off by staying at the each other's places for spring break.
Worst things to do for spring break Get a timeshare. Timeshares are one of the top sellers in the travel industry, but they're also one of the biggest scams on the market today. Think about it. Why spend thousands of dollars on a place you might get to enjoy one week a year? Oh, and you never have any equity in the place. If you're already stuck with one, it is possible to get out from under it. Timeshare Exit Team is dedicated to helping timeshare owners dissolve their unwanted timeshare contracts, legally and forever.
Go to Disney World. Listen, I love me some Disney. I am totally convinced it's the happiest place on earth — except during spring break. Why spend all that money to go during the time of year when everyone else has the exact same idea? If you go just before or after spring break, you'll find shorter lines, happier kids and possibly a better deal.
Use a credit card. Seventy-four percent of Americans have gone into debt for a vacation, so when the Fourth of July rolls around, they're probably still paying off spring break. Like my dad, Dave Ramsey, always says, "The best vacations are the ones that don't follow you home." Putting a vacation on a credit card isn't a good option. Don't let our culture tell you that just because everyone else is doing it, you should too.
If you're planning to travel over spring break, there are plenty of ways to do it on a budget. I put together a Vacation Budget Worksheet to help you make a plan for your money so you can focus on enjoying your trip. This worksheet can also help you determine if taking a vacation really is within your budget. If you can't afford it this year, start saving up the cash and go on an amazing spring break next year. The beach will always be there.

Texto completo: In the days since the Mueller report was concluded and found no collusion between President Trump and Russia, the attention has turned to the press and its perceived hyperfocus on the two-year-long investigation.
Questions about whether outlets like The New York Times, MSNBC or CNN, where I work, spent too much time speculating about the findings or wanting a certain outcome have abounded, and not just from Trump himself.
The RNC complained about what it believes is an imbalance of coverage in an email blast, citing lopsided reporting on the investigation versus the renegotiation of NAFTA, "the Trump admin's successful implementation of middle class tax cuts" and the war against ISIS.
RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel says the press owes the president an apology.
But it's not just Republicans. The press coverage of the Mueller investigation is being questioned by some members of the media as well. Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi wrote, "WMD damaged the media's reputation. Russiagate may have just destroyed it." Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept has been vocally and consistently critical of the media's focus on Russia for years. Michael Tracey catalogued similar grievances in the Daily News.
Self-reflection and an open audit of the way we cover this administration and all other things is always a good idea. It's inarguable that some journalists -- too many -- did what they weren't supposed to do, and openly rooted for an outcome in the Mueller investigation. That is exceedingly damaging to public trust. It also helps cement Trump's dangerous, false narrative, that the press is the enemy of the people.
Among many, many others, however, there was a healthy probing of what might lay behind what to any reasonable observer were a series of puzzling interactions with Russia, a boatload of lies from the president's campaign and administration about those interactions, and consistent displays of affection toward Putin by Trump, who has very few nice things to say about almost anyone else.
But there's another way to view the relationship between Trump and the media. And maybe the question isn't whether the press has been too adversarial to this administration.
Namely: Why wasn't the press just as adversarial to all the others?
The most glaring example is also the most recent. Despite having a slim record of accomplishments upon ascending to the White House, President Obama earned the quick adoration of many in the media. But, with some exceptions, had the press been as systemically suspicious of Obama as it is of Trump, we might not have needed to rely on whistleblowers to expose illegal drone wars, mass data collection or shoddy defense contracts, not to mention an inadequate response to a drug abuse crisis that's now killing tens of thousands of people.
From the Truman administration to the Kennedy administration, a more adversarial press may have uncovered the full level of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War years earlier.
And as openly disapproving of George W. Bush as many in the media were, even that administration received the benefit of the doubt on far too many occasions for far too long, from the passing of the Patriot Act to the justification for the Iraq War.
No modern president, save perhaps Richard Nixon, who waged an outright war on the press, earned the scorn and suspicion that Trump has since the day he took office.
Let's be crystal clear: Trump deserves scorn and suspicion. He is a liar and a huckster. But so too does every person in a position of immense power, because power is inherently corrupting, and because the decisions presidents make impact so many people's lives.
So, yes, let's learn some lessons from this episode -- not just to be better at covering this president, but all future presidents. In fact, we can start right now, by bringing the same level of suspicion -- the Trump treatment, as it were -- to each of the Democratic candidates for president.

Texto completo: When Garrett Oliver was growing up in Hollis, Queens, he would implore his father to "do this, or go do that." His father always had the same response: "I am doing creative nothing." Mr. Oliver, the brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery for 24 years, said that it was not until he "was well into adulthood" that he finally understood what the phrase meant. The author of "The Good Beer Book" and "The Brewmaster's Table, " Mr. Oliver, 56, is a busy man. The editor of "The Oxford Companion to Beer" can also be found judging beer competitions around the world, or creating recipes at the brewery in Williamsburg, as well as at its outpost at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. But on Sundays Mr. Oliver is all about doing creative nothing. He has lived in a brick carriage house in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, since 1996.
NOWHERE MAN Unless I'm going to the beach, I am not going anywhere until at least 12:30 or 1 p.m. That's my chill out time. Breakfast can easily take an hour and a half. I French press my coffee, and sit there with my iPad.
ANYTHING GOES OMELET I eat the same thing every morning -- yogurt, granola. But on Sundays it will be French toast, it will be omelets, leftover omelets. My favorite of the year was mapo tofu a spicy tofu dish my friend made, so I had the leftovers and I made an omelet. It was unbelievable! Things you might never think of, like cassoulet, make a great omelet. Texas chili, that makes a great omelet. Anything that has ground meat and a lot of spice makes a great omelet.

READING, WRITING I'm a paper reader but on the iPad. I read The New York Times, I read New York magazine, I read The Guardian. I bounce around a little bit. I write a fair bit here and there as well. Right now I don't have anything due, but if I promise somebody an article or a review, Sunday is going to be the day that I set aside for that.
JUST THE BASICS I try to fit in some kind of a workout in the afternoon or into the evening. Just the basics. I've got weights, I do push-ups, all that good stuff. If I don't do my certain routine, I can't say I've exercised.

NICHE SHOPPING Christie's is an auction house and most people think that normal people can't go because it's where you sell paintings for $ 60 million. It turns out that Christie's has a lot of really cheap stuff. It's like a museum with a constantly changing exhibit. You might see the entire contents of some mansion. I have two 1920s French club chairs that I bought there which are not only much more comfortable and better built than stuff you would buy today in a good store in New York, but they're like half the price. It's pretty entertaining. It's like a flea market but with much better coffee. If there's any shopping that I need to do I'll do that while I'm up there. I might hit the Lobster Place in Chelsea Market; you can buy lobster parts. That's where I go if I'm going to make lobster stock.
THE BIG PICTURE I either go to the movies at Battery Park City or Turtle Bay. I go for the overall cool crowd and good seating, good-size screens. Those are great theaters.

FREE-FORM I hit the Brooklyn Inn around 5 if I am going to meet someone. If I'm having people over, it starts at 6. Stuff starts early on Sunday, and everything is over by like 9. I like to chill into the evening. Sunday is an impromptu day where I get in touch with people around 2 and say, hey, what are you doing? Saturday has plans, Sunday is free-form.
THE GOODS I might go to Los Paisanos on Smith Street. They have a great selection of sausages. I'll pick up some sausage, cavatelli and whatever kind of cheese they sell at Stinky Bklyn. I'll do the cavatelli, take the skins off the sausage and put it with some cheese and broccolini, and that's really good. I serve as many other types of drinks at home as I do beer. When I serve beers they are often unreleased special beers from the brewery we call the "Ghost Bottles" -- strange, fun things!
20-MINUTE RULE I have a rule for dinner parties, called the 20-minute rule. After people leave I'm willing to do 20 minutes of dishes. At the end of that 20 minutes, the cleanup is over and whatever is left is going to be done the next day. There is always Monday morning.

Jared Kushner meets again with Senate Intelligence Committee

Texto completo: Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior adviser to the President Trump, participated in another closed-door interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Kushner was first interviewed by panel staff in 2017 as part of the committee’s Russia investigation. On Thursday he returned, a senator on the committee confirmed to CNN, because committee members want to re-interview key witnesses.

His latest interview comes on the heels of the release of Attorney General William Barr’s summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on the federal Russia investigation.

During Mueller’s 22 months investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, he “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” Barr’s summary said.

After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, Mueller also began investigating whether Trump obstructed justice. Mueller declined to make a determination in the obstruction inquiry, and Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the president committed a crime.

Mueller’s report, which has not been shared with the public or submitted to members of Congress, is more than 300 pages long, the New York Times reported Thursday.

Texto completo: Victoria Beckham
FIRST SPRING SHOW: 2009
NOTABLE FOR: Sleek silhouettes; proving that a celebrity can tailor
CRITICAL REACTION: "The woman formerly known as Posh Spice has launched a dress collection, and, believe it or not, it's one of the hottest things going in New York this week." —Nicole Phelps, Style.com
WHAT THE DESIGNER SAYS NOW: "I still love that first spring collection… I was creating pieces that I wanted in my own wardrobe, hoping that others would also want them in theirs. It was made up of dresses that I had worked really hard to make perfect, with amazing corsetry and careful boning. We didn't have a fit model, so I did what I needed to do and stripped down to my underwear to try on these amazing pieces."
Joseph Altuzarra
FIRST SPRING SHOW: 2010
READ MORE: THE OFF DUTY SPRING 50
50 Origin Stories Behind Everything From eBay to the Spork
NOTABLE FOR: '70s suede; Swiss dots; slouchy sex appeal
CRITICAL REACTION: "Jolt or not, it was a fascinating show." —Cathy Horyn, The New York Times
WHAT THE DESIGNER SAYS NOW: "It's still one of my favorite collections I've done. It really set the tone for what the Altuzarra woman wears in the spring: she's feminine, undone, floaty and sexy. I don't think I would change a thing! It was the first time I had worked with leather and it was a very steep learning curve, but it did start my love affair with the material. The zipper on the finale gown on Natasha Poly [pictured above] broke a minute before she was supposed to go out on the runway—we had to very quickly take the dress off and sew her into [it]!"
Simone Rocha
FIRST SPRING SHOW: 2012
NOTABLE FOR: A schoolgirl sensibility; clever use of lace; Perspex brogues
CRITICAL REACTION: "This was as polished a performance as we could expect from the very best of London Fashion Week." —Alexander Fury, SHOWstudio.com
WHAT THE DESIGNER SAYS NOW: "The collection was shown in an old townhouse, which we later found out was actually a brothel with a large Jacuzzi in the crypt below the house. I feel proud of the fabrications which are still very signature to me today—lace, tulle, tailoring, transparency. I also like how lots of the looks were very short. I still love the plastic pieces with real lace trapped inside I found in markets. I would change very little. It was right for me at the time and place."
Thom Browne
FIRST SPRING SHOW: 2012
NOTABLE FOR: Lobster claws; extreme proportions; a bird-woman in a cage
CRITICAL REACTION: "Totally weird, amusing, and irritating in equal measure." —WWD
WHAT THE DESIGNER SAYS NOW: "I call it 'The Flapper Show' because it was somewhat '20s-feeling but not literally referencing the era. You saw in the shapes how confident and secure these girls were. It's horrible for me to say, but I think [this collection] was so underrated. There are so many interesting ideas that I still go back and pull from. I have grown and I have evolved, but one thing that hasn't changed is how I want people to see [my shows]. I always knew that I wanted people to have a true experience."
Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler
FIRST SPRING SHOW: 2004
NOTABLE FOR: Youthful shorts; nautical flair; splitting the critics
CRITICAL REACTION: "There were some great pieces…But in the main, it was separates in search of a collection." —Cathy Horyn, The New York Times
WHAT THE DESIGNERS SAY NOW: "We'd just graduated from college and started our collection and we were still experimenting. Vogue called it one of the top 10 collections [of the season]. But Cathy Horyn, who has since become a friend, tore it apart. It was like a dagger through the heart, but she was totally right and we definitely kept [her feedback] in our heads for a couple of seasons," recalled Jack McCollough, who designs Proenza Schouler with Lazaro Hernandez, adding that their design process has evolved significantly.

Texto completo: Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, known for programming like "Friends," "This Is Us" and the "Real Housewives" franchise, wants to sell you golf socks and polos.
The company plans to introduce e-commerce marketplaces, seeking a new revenue stream from brands that aren't necessarily buying costly national TV ads.
The first marketplace, called Shop With Golf, will be aligned with NBCU's Golf Channel, selling products from brands that cater to fans of the sport. William Murray Golf, an apparel brand from actor Bill Murray and his five brothers, is among the 30-plus brands initially slated to sell products on the website.
"This is not about trying to sell more GRPs," said Josh Feldman, head of marketing and advertising creative at NBCUniversal, referring to gross rating points, a common TV advertising metric. "This is about creating a new opportunity for brand partners that creates a new revenue stream for us. What we're offering is having a trusted brand, an authority on golf, be able to sell directly to their fan base."
NBCU doesn't expect Shop With Golf to be profitable in its first year, Mr. Feldman said, but soon after that it aims to generate revenue and profits in the seven figures.
Revenue from the e-commerce platforms will be small compared to the sums that NBCU generates from ad sales and the distribution of its programming to pay-TV companies, but the move signals an attempt to diversify its business and adjust to a fast-changing media business dominated by online consumption.
NBCU tapped Mr. Murray to help it promote Shop With Golf. In a 30-second TV ad set to run for 13 weeks across various NBCU properties including MSNBC and CNBC, Mr. Murray loosely evaluates his own performance on the golf course—a joke for golfers who are notorious for inflating their scores. Mr. Murray and his five brothers also star in an online music video accessible on the website, among content featuring other brands.
The marketplace strategy was inspired by changing media consumption and shopping habits, Mr. Feldman said.
Traditional media companies are now competing for ad dollars with digital media giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., which use targeted ads to reach specific groups of consumers that advertisers covet. TV advertising hasn't been so precise.
NBCU will take a cut of revenue from products sold on its platforms. The company, which declined to disclose more details about the revenue-share arrangement, said it would also produce and distribute promotional content for brands that want to pay for those services. For example, the Shop With Golf site includes an article about the lifestyle of Shep Rose of "Southern Charm," a reality show on NBCU's Bravo network. Mr. Rose is selling his golf-inspired apparel line Shep Gear in the shop.
NBCU isn't necessarily trying to take on Amazon.com Inc., which accounts for nearly half of all online sales in the U.S.
Media companies have been expanding their business lines, adding revenue from product licensing and so-called affiliate programs as their core business has been hit by fragmenting audiences and other challenges.
An affiliate program at NBC's "Today" show, for example, drives people to outside e-commerce sites to purchase the products that it features. (NBC has said the "Today" shop, which receives regular promotion in segments on the show, generates millions of dollars in gross sales, including $5 million on one day last October.)
NBCU's marketplace effort is different because consumers won't leave the site to purchase products.
BuzzFeed Inc. and New York Times Co. have also invested in e-commerce businesses that recommend products to consumers .

Texto completo: ALBANY - New York has some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world. Now it has another distinction: the tallest male politician in the world.
Robert Cornegy Jr, a New York City councilman from Brooklyn, made the Guinness World Records on Wednesday after he was measured at 6-foot-10.
Cornegy, 53, was honored Wednesday for the distinction by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who himself stands 6-foot-5.
Cornegy said the goal is to encourage children to strive to be their best, regardless of their physical stature.
"Today I get to send a resounding message to all the young people in the world who may have come in different packages, so they may not have the normal physical stature and would like to still make a difference, you can absolutely do that," he said at a City Hall ceremony.
"And you don't need to be relegated to a particular segment of society based on how you look."
Breaking the record Cornegy took office in 2014 and was a reserve basketball player on the legendary 1984-85 St. John's team that went to the Final Four and included city legends Chris Mullin and Mark Jackson.
He later graduated from Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, Westchester County, and played professional basketball overseas.
Cornegy said it was an arduous process to get the record: He had to get measured by three doctors at the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn after Guinness wanted a tally that wasn't from St. John's.
He said he was measured repeatedly. In fact, one measurement put him at 6-foot-11 and a half, but the measurements averaged to 6-foot-10.
"We had several measurements that had to be taken in several positions over a long period of time," Cornegy said.
Why the record is important Cornegy said being tall is often viewed by people as a good thing, but it comes with challenges.
He said he has to be cognizant of not standing too close to constituents for fear that he is intimidating them.
When he was a teenager, he recalled how he would go clothes shopping with friends, but couldn't find anything his size.
"It's tough when you are just trying to fit in," he said Wednesday.
And with a 17-inch shoe size, he has to get custom shoes and suits, which are expensive.
So he said the recognition aims to let people know that "you can lead no matter how you look or no matter what shape you're in, or not matter what size you come in."
Guinness officials told the New York Times that Cornegy bested Sir Louis Gluckstein, a London politician who died in 1979, by two and a half inches.
De Blasio joked he usually is the tallest person in the room, and even hopped up on the step behind the City Hall podium to stand at eye level with Cornegy.
"This man's head is never in the clouds — despite the fact that his head is quite literally always in the crowd," de Blasio joked.
Then the mayor added, "I can't wait to see what world record Robert Cornegy breaks next. He has limitless potential."
New York City Councilman Robert Cornegy, D-Brooklyn, was honored at New York City Hall by Mayor Bill de Blasio for receiving the Guinness World Record for world's tallest male politician on Wednesday. Cornegy is 6-foot-10.

Trump-Russia Made for Gripping Fiction

Texto completo: Good generals learn to discipline their imaginations. Armies may be lost if their hopes or fears leap ahead of the facts of battle. That's true for journalists as well. It's essential not to become overcommitted to a vivid story line.
Reporters gather facts, then weave them into a story. Every storyteller's temptation is to embellish -- to make the tale more vivid, dramatic, entertaining. Donald and Volodya! Sexual perversion in a Moscow hotel! The epic of Donald Trump and Russian collusion is a cautionary example that will be taught in journalism schools.
Mr. Trump's peculiarities set the scene -- his unusual life story, far from the norms of politics and government; his theatrical personality, disdain for niceties, gift for ridicule, populist instinct, mastery of provocation. His defiant and inventive embrace of his own boorishness. Above all, there was his assault on the mainstream media, or "fake news." So bafflingly unorthodox and outrageous was Mr. Trump that he coaxed journalists to accept story lines equally unorthodox and outrageous. With such a man anything was possible, so why should he not be a Russian agent? And there was always the reliably Manichaean black-and-white of the narrative: Mr. Trump, in the eyes of his enemies in media and elsewhere, was manifestly all things wicked.
Amid intense criticism of the media, the Washington Post's Margaret Sullivan fired back: "Serious journalists should be proud of -- not bullied over -- their Russia reporting." She added: "Reality-based news outlets have done quite well on this story." What does "reality-based" mean? If a "reality-based" police department follows an elaborate string of leads and arrests an innocent man -- a guy they never liked anyway -- it would be impertinent for the detectives afterward to claim, as one newspaper did, that "important digging requires no apologies."
The New York Times used to be called the "gray lady" -- a zone of fastidious dullness, guided by the ethos that the truth is necessarily so complicated that it can rarely be merely entertaining and in any case is not congenial to anything as vulgar as story lines. The Times's earnest style belonged to the 20th century, or even the 19th. Today, almost all media organizations have reversed priorities and, in their quest for hearts and minds and eyeballs, have committed themselves to the outlandish and vivid, and to every fashionable indignation. The Russian collusion story seemed to have everything -- a spectacular story line and a fabulous cast, with the ineffable Donald Trump playing the lead.
The Mueller report may not settle anything. The campaign for president will still be a civil war of mutually incompatible story lines. America's turmoil is part of nothing less than the continuing creation and re-creation of the country, whose secret has always been to reconstitute itself, peacefully if possible.
Witness is a term that is both religious and legal. The proper role of the journalist is that of witness -- in both senses of the word -- to the country's re-creation. Honest witness requires humility, a virtue all but extinct in 21st-century media. This may be a moment for those who do the work to draw back a little from the partisan drama and to think about their task in the largest terms.

Cruise ship reaches shore after harrowing rescues

Texto completo: LONDON - A cruise ship that set out with more than 1,300 people but became stranded off Norway's coast finally reached the shore Sunday afternoon, after rescuers launched a harrowing operation in rough weather to evacuate hundreds of people one by one by helicopter.
More than 890 people - 436 passengers and 458 crew members - were left on the 47,800-ton ship, the Viking Sky, as it headed to Molde, a coastal town in western Norway. On Sunday about 4:30 p.m. local time, after about six hours of traveling at sea with one tugboat in front and another in the rear, the vessel docked.
In footage shared on Twitter, cheers and whoops could be heard from onshore.
"It has reached Molde; everything has gone according to plan," Einar Knudsen, a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center for Southern Norway, which led the rescue operation, said by phone Sunday.
Earlier, some passengers, who were airlifted from the ship's deck, had arrived onshore bruised and battered, the Red Cross said. Passengers told NBC News that many had been hurt by falling objects and shattered glass as waves rocked the ship.
"Nothing similar has happened before, not in this magnitude," Knudsen said.
The ship, which left Bergen, Norway, on March 14, had been scheduled to arrive Tuesday in Tilbury Port on the River Thames in southeastern England. Passengers onboard included people from the United States, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
But when the vessel was traveling between two Norwegian ports, Tromso and Stavanger, it sent a mayday alert Saturday afternoon that several engines had failed.
It was not immediately clear what had caused the cruise ship to lose power. But it did so along a particularly dangerous part of the Norwegian coastline called Hustadvika, according to Eirik Walle, a coordinator for the southern rescue center.
Five helicopters and several other vessels were involved in the rescue effort. (According to local reports, two helicopters also helped a cargo ship Saturday, the Hagland Captain, which was in Norwegian waters when it sent an SOS message saying it, too, had "engine problems." The crew members were evacuated.)
Rough weather - high winds and 26-foot waves - hampered the effort to evacuate the passengers of the Viking Sky, which began around 2 p.m. local time Saturday. At least three passengers sustained serious injuries.
"Currently, we understand 20 people suffered injuries as a result of this incident," a spokesman for Viking Cruises, which operates the ship, said by email. He added that they were all receiving medical care in Norway and that some had been discharged.
The Red Cross said Sunday that several of the rescued passengers had suffered cuts or broken bones. "Many are also traumatized by what they have experienced, and need to be taken care of when they land," the statement said.
Video footage shared by the cruise ship passengers on social media showed a terrifying ordeal as the ship swayed and furniture, plants and people were sent sliding across the floor. Other footage depicted hundreds of people strapped in fluorescent life jackets as water rushed past their feet inside the ship.
"The ship is rocking and rolling but at anchor," Alexus Sheppard, a passenger, told The New York Times on Saturday after having waited to be evacuated for six hours. "Everyone is calm, except when we get rolled by a big wave," she said.
"Everything was breaking, furniture, glassware," Susan Dollberg of Novato, California, told NRK, the Norwegian government-owned broadcaster. "The closet doors were banging back and forth." She added, "When we got the signal to evacuate, there was no time to think about getting important things like passports."
Passengers commended the ship's crew members, who gave water to the passengers and made them sandwiches. "The crew, the Norwegian people and the rescue operation have been stellar," Dollberg said.
Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian founder and chairman of Viking Cruises, which has its headquarters in Switzerland, said the passengers would be compensated. "They will get their money back," he said, adding, "They will also have a letter from me, and be invited back again."

Texto completo: Good generals learn to discipline their imaginations. Armies may be lost if their hopes or fears leap ahead of the facts of battle. That's true for journalists as well. It's essential not to become overcommitted to a vivid story line.
Reporters gather facts, then weave them into a story. Every storyteller's temptation is to embellish—to make the tale more vivid, dramatic, entertaining. Donald and Volodya! Sexual perversion in a Moscow hotel! The epic of Donald Trump and Russian collusion is a cautionary example that will be taught in journalism schools.
Mr. Trump's peculiarities set the scene—his unusual life story, far from the norms of politics and government; his theatrical personality, disdain for niceties, gift for ridicule, populist instinct, mastery of provocation. His defiant and inventive embrace of his own boorishness. Above all, there was his assault on the mainstream media, or "fake news." So bafflingly unorthodox and outrageous was Mr. Trump that he coaxed journalists to accept story lines equally unorthodox and outrageous. With such a man anything was possible, so why should he not be a Russian agent? And there was always the reliably Manichaean black-and-white of the narrative: Mr. Trump, in the eyes of his enemies in media and elsewhere, was manifestly all things wicked.
Amid intense criticism of the media, the Washington Post's Margaret Sullivan fired back: "Serious journalists should be proud of—not bullied over—their Russia reporting." She added: "Reality-based news outlets have done quite well on this story." What does "reality-based" mean? If a "reality-based" police department follows an elaborate string of leads and arrests an innocent man—a guy they never liked anyway—it would be impertinent for the detectives afterward to claim, as one newspaper did, that "important digging requires no apologies."
The New York Times used to be called the "gray lady"—a zone of fastidious dullness, guided by the ethos that the truth is necessarily so complicated that it can rarely be merely entertaining and in any case is not congenial to anything as vulgar as story lines. The Times's earnest style belonged to the 20th century, or even the 19th. Today, almost all media organizations have reversed priorities and, in their quest for hearts and minds and eyeballs, have committed themselves to the outlandish and vivid, and to every fashionable indignation. The Russian collusion story seemed to have everything—a spectacular story line and a fabulous cast, with the ineffable Donald Trump playing the lead.
The Mueller report may not settle anything. The campaign for president will still be a civil war of mutually incompatible story lines. America's turmoil is part of nothing less than the continuing creation and re-creation of the country, whose secret has always been to reconstitute itself, peacefully if possible.
Witness is a term that is both religious and legal. The proper role of the journalist is that of witness—in both senses of the word—to the country's re-creation. Honest witness requires humility, a virtue all but extinct in 21st-century media. This may be a moment for those who do the work to draw back a little from the partisan drama and to think about their task in the largest terms.
Mr. Morrow is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

JOURNALISTS MUST DIG THE SERIOUS ONES HAVE DONE SOME GREAT WORK

Texto completo: It should be no surprise that President Donald Trump's reaction to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report is to attack reporters for doing their jobs.
That's what he has been doing for years. It's a predictable political strategy - an ugly, anti-democratic one - that feeds raw meat to his base.
And it should be no surprise that his media echo chamber - led by Fox's Sean Hannity - is calling for the heads of journalists whose work Mr. Hannity couldn't begin to emulate.
As for the rest of the harsh criticism that's being leveled at journalists who dug into the connections between Mr. Trump, as candidate and president, and Russia, it's largely misguided.
Fairly typical of this was conservative writer Rich Lowry, who said the three biggest losers from Mr. Mueller's report were "the media, the media, the media," which he described as "obsessed and hysterical for two years."
There are calls for a "reckoning" on news coverage.All right. Here goes.
I reckon that American citizens would have been far worse off if skilled reporters hadn't dug into the connections between Mr. Trump's associates and Russians. That reporting has not been invalidated.
I reckon that the lying to the public about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow remains a scandal - and that we know about this in large part because journalists were doing their jobs aggressively.
I reckon that the hard-nosed reporting about former national security adviser Michael Flynn - roundly denied, you might recall, before it was proved - was an early sign of venality that was to follow.
I reckon that reporting by The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, Bloomberg News, the Daily Beast, ProPublica and others have driven a national conversation that needed to happen. As Americans saw with their own eyes, Mr. Trump's bizarre efforts to ingratiate himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that reporting mattered and provided context.
That shouldn't be forgotten.
And yes, I reckon that endless speculative threads and the explosions of tiny cannon on Twitter were ridiculous and over the top - and that the cable pundits who made a living off such speculation aren't really journalists.
It's important to acknowledge the value of the serious journalism because there's a real risk that some news organizations will take the edges off their coverage of this subject now.You could see it starting to happen over the weekend.
It was strange, for example, to see Scott Pelley's lead-in to CBS's "60 Minutes" erroneously describe the Mueller report's findings in a way that Mr. Trump might have scripted: He flatly stated that the report, as described by Attorney General William Barr, had exonerated the president.
In fact, Mr. Mueller came to no such conclusion on obstruction of justice and stated specifically that his investigation did not exonerate Mr. Trump.
Perhaps cowed by the criticism - which came from the left as well as the right, most notably from author Matt Taibbi - some news organizations may back down from aggressive coverage of Mr. Trump.
That would be a serious mistake. With some regrettable exceptions - individual stories that went too far - reality-based news outlets have done quite well on this story.
And it's no time to retreat.
What would be a good idea, though, is to be less obsessed with this subject to the exclusion of others that are far closer to home for most Americans: health care, the economy, affordable housing and crime.
"We've done two listening tours across the U.S. in the past two years, and it was striking how Trump, Russia and Mueller just never came up," HuffPost Editor Lydia Polgreen told me. As a result, "we haven't invested heavily in covering the Trump/Russia story in terms of enterprise."
Similarly, I've been thinking of Christine Radwan, a Trump voter (and former Democrat) I interviewed in rural New York state in 2017.
When I asked her whether possible Russian collusion mattered to her, she paused and then answered thoughtfully: "Yes, it's important, but not as important as our economy and what's happened to our middle class."
This is not to suggest that serious news organizations should drop the Trump/Russia story, which is still playing out. Nor should they allow themselves to be bullied about the important work they've done, and must continue to do.

With the iPhone Sputtering, Apple Bets Its Future on TV and News; Tim Cook is gambling that selling services, an area filled with risks and competition, will be the company's next chapter

Texto completo: The iPhone is running out of juice. To go beyond the device that made Apple Inc. a global colossus, Tim Cook is betting on a suite of services—marking the company's biggest shift in more than a decade.
The chief executive's strategy, years in the making, takes Apple out of its comfort zone into areas where it has failed in the past, and that today are replete with risks and competition. Apple will take a giant leap toward its goal on Monday, when it plans to announce video- and news-subscription services that it hopes will generate billions of dollars in new annual revenue and deepen ties between iPhone users and the company.
In some ways, Apple helped create its own predicament when it launched the app industry a decade ago. The goal was to make the iPhone more powerful.
Over time, though, apps and services, from Spotify to Netflix to China's WeChat, have often become more important to users than the devices that run them. That allows consumers to hold on to phones longer or switch to less expensive versions. In January, Apple reported its first decline in revenue and profit for a holiday quarter in over a decade.
By contrast, revenue from the services business grew 33% last year, to nearly $40 billion—accounting for about 15% of the company's total of $265.6 billion.
The company's ambition in video is to become an alternative to cable, combining original series with shows from other networks to create a new entertainment service that can reach more than 100 markets world-wide. It is the tech giant's latest attempt to reinvent television, something it has tried to do for about a decade with limited success.
On Monday, the tech giant plans to unveil the first footage from some of its new original TV shows, according to people familiar with the event. Apple has used a $1 billion budget to buy dozens of original TV shows in hopes it can land a breakout hit. It has cut deals with Hollywood stars including actor Reese Witherspoon and director J.J. Abrams, who have been invited to attend Monday's event on Apple's campus, according to those people.
Apple declined to comment for this article.
Apple hasn't said what it will charge for the programming. People working on the projects said the company plans to charge a fee, after previously saying it would be free to Apple device owners.
The original series will be delivered in a new TV app that staff have been calling a Netflix killer. It will make it easier for people to subscribe with a single click to channels such as Starz, Showtime and HBO, with which Apple has been negotiating to offer their shows to users for $9.99 a month each, people familiar with the talks said.
Apple has been negotiating to bring its new TV app to multiple platforms, including Roku and smart TVs, according to people familiar with the talks—an unusual move for a company that has long preferred to limit its software and services to its own devices. Some of those distribution agreements are expected to be announced Monday.
At the same event, Apple plans to showcase a revamped News app that includes a premium tier with access to more than 200 magazines—including Bon Appétit, People and Glamour—as well as newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal. It plans to charge $9.99 for the service and believes the premium news content can lift engagement on its devices, people familiar with the plans said. The New York Times earlier reported on the Journal's participation.
As part of the arrangement, much of the Journal's content will be available through the service, although certain types of stories—particularly general news, politics and lifestyles news—will be showcased, while business and finance news won't be displayed as prominently, according to people familiar with the situation. The deal will result in the Journal hiring more reporters focused on general news to help feed Apple's product, one of the people said. The Journal sells its own subscriptions for $39 a month.
The news subscription offering follows Apple's 2018 acquisition of a Netflix-for-news app called Texture . The deal gave Apple rights to most major North American magazines for at least five years and up to two decades in an agreement that splits revenue 50-50 between the tech giant and publishers such as Hearst Magazines and Condé Nast, according to people familiar with the deal.
The terms rankled some newspapers Apple courted, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which sell monthly subscriptions for $15 and $10, respectively. The Washington Post and New York Times aren't participating in the new app, according to people familiar with the situation.
Pushing services
When Apple last found itself on the ropes in the early 2000s, co-founder Steve Jobs reinvented the company by pushing it into mobile devices. The iPod and its accompanying iTunes service revived a company that was largely dependent on Mac computer sales. The subsequent iPhone helped Apple become the first company to surpass $1 trillion in market value last year.
Mr. Cook, who succeeded Mr. Jobs, is attempting a similar feat in the approaching twilight of the smartphone era. He began pushing the services strategy hard in late 2017, after Apple launched its 10th-anniversary smartphone, the iPhone X. While a big price increase to nearly $1,000 was helping boost revenue, the iPhone X wasn't selling more phones , and higher prices made sophisticated, lower-cost rival devices more appealing.
Mr. Cook, who had vowed earlier that year to double Apple's services revenue by 2020, began meeting regularly with the services division.
At the monthly sessions, the 58-year-old CEO has peppered the team with detailed questions. He wanted services team members to tell him which apps were selling well, how many Apple Music subscribers stuck with the service, and how many people were signing up for iCloud storage, a costly service that required spending billions of dollars to build data centers around the U.S., according to people familiar with the meetings.
"You couldn't say, 'I don't have that information. I'll get that tonight,' " said one person involved. "You had to have a dictionary of backup."
Apple's biggest source of services revenue comes from distributing other companies' software through its App Store. The company is now battling Spotify and Netflix, two of the most popular apps, over its practice of taking 30% of sales or subscription revenue from apps.
Netflix recently stopped letting users sign up for its service on Apple devices, and said it won't participate in Apple's video subscription service. Spotify AB this month filed an antitrust complaint in Europe claiming Apple abuses its control over the App Store, something Apple denies.
Apple's music-streaming service, its biggest attempt so far to build its own subscription business, has about 50 million global subscribers—far behind Spotify's 96 million.
Apple's base of 1.4 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs in use globally gives it a distribution platform. Yet the businesses of selling gadgets and services can conflict. To reach the biggest possible market for video service, Apple would have to offer it on non-Apple devices—something it has been loath to do in years past.
Previous successes with services such as iTunes, which redefined the music industry, have been offset by troubles with Maps and Siri.
"They built an organization to make beautiful gadgets and compete with Samsung and other gray-box manufacturers," said Mike Levin, co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology analysis firm. "Now, they have to really think about the services and software that have been so uneven and compete with a lot of very different competitors."
Mr. Cook has said Apple retains its edge. "Apple innovates like no other company on Earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas," he told investors in January, when Apple reported earnings.
Apple's stock, while up since early January, remains 20% below its peak in October. It is currently valued at $900.85 billion.
App resistance
Co-founder Mr. Jobs foreshadowed Apple's services future when he started iTunes in 2001, offering categories from competing major labels to make the first successful digital-music store, with songs available for 99 cents.
When Apple created the iPhone in 2007, Mr. Jobs opposed letting other companies sell apps for it, fearing they could undercut performance or introduce viruses.
Apple's software team, recognizing that more apps could make the phone more dynamic, pushed back and prevailed. The resulting App Store has generated more than $120 billion in total sales for developers since it opened in 2008.
It also brought competition from rivals such as Spotify, which began selling subscriptions in the U.S. in 2011.
The competition led to Apple's biggest deal, its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics LLC in 2014, so Apple could launch a competing music-streaming service.
By then, concerns had already been rising inside Apple about the iPhone's future. The number of devices Apple sold was growing more than 20% annually as Mr. Cook pushed it into new retailers and markets, but sales executives told colleagues in 2014 they were running out of avenues for easy growth, former employees said. "They were freaked out," one person said.
During a presentation before the launch, the music-streaming team told Mr. Cook they expected to generate more than 10 million subscribers in the first year.
"Double that," said Mr. Cook, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The executives ended up easily clearing the goal, which encouraged them about Mr. Cook's vision for the opportunity in services, the person said.
Mr. Cook and Eddy Cue, his lieutenant in charge of services, started looking for other subscription opportunities. Video was an immediate priority. Apple's share of movie sales and rentals was more than 50% in 2012. By 2017 it had fallen to between 20% and 35% .
Apple wanted a service that could beat Netflix, a person familiar with the company's plan said. After a 2015 effort to persuade Walt Disney Co. and others to join a streaming-TV service faltered, Apple's executives debated alternatives, including acquiring Walt Disney Co. or Netflix, and building its own studio, people familiar with the discussions said.
In 2017, it hired two prominent executives from Sony Pictures Television and empowered them to cut deals for more than two dozen original programs. They scooped up a reboot of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television's "Amazing Stories," scored a series about a morning talk show starring Ms. Witherspoon, and struck a partnership with Oprah Winfrey.
Apple faces steep competition from big spenders while it plays catch-up to experienced rivals. Netflix has 139 million subscribers and is expected to spend $15 billion on content this year. It also offers a far deeper content library than Apple plans to make available. Disney, which has decades of experience making hit shows and movies, plans to launch its own streaming service later this year.
Morgan Stanley estimates that a combined media package from Apple that includes video and music could generate more than $22 billion in sales by 2025.
Previously, Apple used software and services to sell more of its own devices. In January, Apple announced it would put a TV app on sets made by rival Samsung Electronics Co., making it available to people who don't necessarily own any Apple hardware.
Apple executives made clear during talks with TV makers that it needed as broad a reach as possible to compete with Netflix and others. Last year, Apple announced a similar agreement with rival Amazon.com Inc. to bring Apple Music to Echo smart speakers.
"We made a mistake with Apple Music, thinking we could go it alone, and it took a long time to catch up. We still aren't there yet," the head of marketing Apple services, Jon Giselman, said during a meeting with one of the company's partners, according to a person in attendance.
The push into news subscriptions could help Apple battle Facebook Inc., whose News Feed has helped it become the No. 1 app world-wide in monthly active smartphone users. It is also the anchor of a business that Facebook is looking to expand by emphasizing private messaging , a step many interpret as the first in an effort to become a super-app like China's WeChat, which allows users to shop, order food, buy movie tickets and make reservations on any mobile operating system.
For Mr. Cook's monthly services meetings, the company has intensified monitoring of apps that benefit and threaten Apple. The team has created a release radar for the CEO to track apps that are expected to sell well and other metrics for the apps that have challenged Apple's business, including iTunes sales decreases compared with Apple Music subscription growth, said the person involved with the meetings.
Other successful subscription apps have given away much more content at lower prices than Apple is expected to offer initially. Amazon Prime members, who pay $119 annually, get free video content and discounted music subscriptions. Some inside Apple's services group wanted similar benefits for iPhone buyers. Mr. Cook and his leadership team have made it clear that its forthcoming services will carry a price tag.
"There's this conflict between wanting to become a services business and acting like one," said the person. "They haven't solved that."

Texto completo: Robert Mueller's investigation is over, but questions still abound. Not about collusion, Russian interference or obstruction of justice, but about the leading lights of journalism who managed to get the story so wrong, and for so long.
It wasn't merely an error here or there. America's blue-chip journalists botched the entire story, from its birth during the presidential campaign to its final breath Sunday—and they never stopped congratulating themselves for it. Last year the New York Times and Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize "for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation's understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect's transition team and his eventual administration." A 2017 Time magazine cover depicted the White House getting a "makeover" to transform it into the Kremlin.
All based on a theory—that the president of the United States was a Russian asset—produced by a retired foreign spy whose work was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. An unbiased observer would have taken the theory's partisan provenance as a red flag, but most political journalists saw nothing but green lights. No unverified rumor was too salacious and no anonymous tip was too outlandish to print. From CNN to the Times and the Post, from esteemed and experienced reporters to opinion writers and bloggers, everyone wanted a share of the Trump-treason beat. What good is the 21st-century Watergate if you don't at least make an effort to cast yourself as the fearless journalist risking it all who got that one big tip that brought down a president?
Not only did the press fail to destroy Donald Trump's presidency; it provided voluminous evidence for his repeated charge of "fake news."
Take CNN. The network reported in December 2017 that Donald Trump Jr. received special email access to stolen documents before their public release by WikiLeaks—an accusation that, if true, could have proved the president's inner circle was colluding with Russian hackers intent on taking down Mrs. Clinton. But it turned out "the most trusted name in news" misreported the dates on the unsolicited emails to the president's son. They had been sent to him days after WikiLeaks had published the pilfered documents. CNN still hasn't explained why it failed to do basic due diligence on such an important story.
Another CNN foul-up came in June 2017, the month after President Trump fired James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey had assured him three times that he wasn't under FBI investigation. The network reported Mr. Comey would directly refute the president's claim under oath. In reality, Mr. Comey's own memos explicitly confirmed Mr. Trump's statement.
A December 2016 Washington Post story "incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid," as a later editor's note acknowledged. "Authorities say there is no indication of that so far." Slate falsely claimed in October 2016 that Mr. Trump's computers were secretly sharing information with a Russian bank as part of a scheme to avoid detection.
Each new claim, true or not, became fodder for political pundits. Sure, there may be no actual smoking gun or verified information or anything even approximating evidence, but if you take all the disparate pieces and put them on the same corkboard, stand back at just the right distance, and squint really hard, you can almost make out a barrel and a plume of smoke.
Enter Jonathan Chait of New York magazine, author of the classic 2003 article "Why I Hate George W. Bush." ("I hate the way he walks. . . . I hate the way he talks. . . . I even hate the things that everybody seems to like about him.") Last July, before Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Mr. Chait penned a nearly 8,000-word piece titled "Will Trump Be Meeting With His Counterpart—or His Handler?" Mr. Chait's speculation—that "Trump has been a Russian asset since 1987"—was worthy of the late Lyndon LaRouche.
In a January 2019 Twitter thread, meanwhile, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman asserted that "the failure to connect the dots on Trump-Russia" was one of the "big failures of 2016 campaign coverage." He added: "There is no sin quite as offensive as challenging conventional wisdom early, and then being proved right."
Many in Washington and around the country believed Mr. Mueller's investigation would put the entire issue to rest. If there was collusion, he'd find it. If there was obstruction of justice, he'd prosecute it. Whatever he found, the nation would accept it and move on. "The best thing for our country is that Trump is innocent and that Mueller tells us he's found nothing," Garrett Graff of Wired tweeted Thursday, the day before Mr. Mueller submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr. "Mueller got everything he wanted," Mr. Graff wrote Friday. "Never blocked by DOJ in pursuing something he requested. That's big."
But the next day, Mr. Graff excoriated Nikki Haley for agreeing: "No, everyone does not have to acknowledge that Trump didn't interfere with Mueller," Mr. Graff tweeted Saturday at the former United Nations ambassador. By Monday Mr. Graff was insisting that "a million questions" about Trump-Russia collusion remain.
Likewise, on Monday the irrepressible Mr. Chait insisted the president could still be guilty: "People who want to demonstrate their innocence make displays of cooperation with investigators," he wrote. "His flamboyant refusal to cooperate deprives Trump of any claim to having been cleared."
So much for accepting Robert Mueller's conclusions and recommendations. If your objective is to bring down Mr. Trump, nothing Mr. Mueller or anyone else finds—or fails to find—makes a difference. Mr. Trump didn't collude with Russia, but he did defeat Mrs. Clinton. From their behavior it is evident that many in the media view that as sufficient to establish his guilt. For them, the Trump-Russia investigation was never about protecting democracy or securing elections—never mind telling the truth, which is supposed to be their job.

Wall Street Journal's Partnership With Apple Marks Shift in Strategy; Journal joins $9.99-a-month Apple news app, betting it can expand its digital customer base without undercutting paper's core business

Texto completo: The Wall Street Journal is a launch partner for Apple Inc.'s $9.99-a-month news service, marking a significant shift in strategy meant to draw in new readers and paying subscribers without undercutting the publication's core business.
Apple unveiled the news app, Apple News+, at an event Monday. It will provide access to articles from more than 300 magazines including Vogue, GQ and Sports Illustrated. In addition to the Journal, the Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star will be the other North American newspapers joining the service.
Apple will take a substantial cut of the revenue—it was seeking a 50% share in talks with publishers, people familiar with the discussions say. Media partners will get a portion of the monthly fees based on readership of their stories.
Journal executives declined to comment on the terms of revenue sharing.
Other major news outlets including the New York Times and Washington Post engaged in talks with Apple, people familiar with the situation said, but chose not to join the new service.
The Journal for years has focused on building its digital subscriber base, appealing to a core audience of people interested in business and financial news. The paper finished 2018 with 1.71 million digital subscribers, with a full-priced subscription costing $39 a month. Its print subscribers totaled about 840,000. The Apple partnership is viewed as an opportunity to bring in revenue from a broader audience.
William Lewis, chief executive of Dow Jones & Co. and publisher of the Journal, said at a meeting for newsroom staff that the deal "will enable us to get our journalism in front of millions of people who may never have paid for our journalism before."
Robert Thomson, chief executive of Journal parent News Corp, has been among the most vocal critics of tech companies such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. He said the Apple deal was a measured and smart bet. "It's important that we partner with tech companies when that makes sense" and "pursue them" when necessary, he said at the newsroom meeting.
The partnership carries risks for the Journal, since each Apple user will generate much less subscription revenue for the company than a full-priced subscriber. Journal executives said they weren't concerned about existing subscribers canceling service to shift to the Apple service, because the two offerings will be fundamentally different.
The Apple app will surface stories thought to be of interest to a general reader—that could be national news, politics, sports and leisure news, but also some business news, people familiar with the situation said. The paper's entire slate of business and financial news will also be searchable within the app, but the thinking is that most users won't consume much beyond what is actively presented to them.
Apple users will have access to only three days' worth of the Journal's archive, the people said. The Journal also negotiated terms that would allow it to drop out of the service, they said.
"I have not entered into this deal lightly," Mr. Lewis said in his newsroom talk. "It was never worth doing a bad deal."
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Lewis said the shift by the Journal was a milestone as significant as the launch of a paywall on the Journal's website in 1996, more than a decade before most of the news industry.
To meet the needs of the Apple product, the Journal will be hiring around 50 additional newsroom staffers, the people familiar with the situation said.
While Apple won't share customer data with the publishers, participating news outlets will be able to see what is being read and target regular visitors with specific offers for things like newsletters, said Suzi Watford, the Journal's chief marketing officer.
The Los Angeles Times is also hopeful that the Apple partnership will jump-start its digital business.
"We have every confidence that the Apple affiliation will spur the growth of our digital subscriptions," said Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner and executive chairman of the Times.

Texto completo: Curtain up and light the lights: Apple’s almost certain to be star-studded press gathering is now but hours away.
Here’s what you’re likely to hear once Tim Cook takes the stage, and how to tune in if you aren’t a member of the media or one of the invited guests sitting in the audience at the Steve Jobs Theater at the company’s Apple Park campus.
Where To Watch
Apple will be livestreaming the event at its website. It’s also fitting, given the expected news of the day, that you’ll also be able to watch on your big screen television you’ve connected an Apple TV set-top box. Download the Apple Events app from the App Store on the Apple TV device.
When does the event start?
The festivities are scheduled to begin at 1 p. m. ET. Broadway shows typically start five minutes after the announced curtain time; movies only start after you've been treated to a strong of trailers. Apple press events typically start on time.
What will we hear?
Unless all the pre-event chatter has been way off base—and there’s no reason believe that it has been—Apple is almost certainly going to showcase its answer to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime video, with an entertainment-based video streaming service of its own. Likely base cost for consumers, $9. 99 a month, with extra fees for premium content from HBO and Showtime.

At the same time, though, Apple is also expected to announce some kind of news and magazine news service, featuring such publications--again if the pre-launch rumors prove accurate-as the Wall Street Journal and People Magazine. Unknown are the state of other big-time properties, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and yes, USA TODAY.
Still to be answered: How will Apple package the new services and, for that matter, bring the existing Apple Music service into the fold?
And when do all the new services actually get going?
What kind of original content might we see?
Aside from Apple’s earliest efforts in TV content—versions of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” and a reality show “Planet of the Apps”—it is premature to weigh in on the quality of the shows that are likely to appear on Apple’s service.
We do know the quality of the Hollywood types Apple is working with and the roster includes some of the biggest names in showbiz: including Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, J. J. Abrams, Jennifer Garner, M. Night Shyamalan, even Sesame Workshop. It's a good bet you'll see Cupertino cameos from some or all of the above.
What we also know is that the company is parting with some of its riches to to propel the launch of the new services, to the tune of at least $1 billion.
Is Apple going to unveil new hardware?
This seems like an unlikely prospect, except perhaps a freshened up revamped version of the Apple TV box. Apple pretty much cleared the decks for new physical products last week having unveiled in successive days new versions of the iPad mini and iPad Air tablets, iMac desktop computers, and AirPods wireless headphones.
What we may see, however, is a new Apple credit card.

Apple Bets Its Future On TV and News --- Maker of iPhone, now waning, hopes selling services will generate new growth

Texto completo: The iPhone is running out of juice. To go beyond the device that made Apple Inc. a global colossus, Tim Cook is betting on a suite of services -- marking the company's biggest shift in more than a decade.
The chief executive's strategy, years in the making, takes Apple out of its comfort zone into areas where it has failed in the past, and that today are replete with risks and competition. Apple will take a giant leap toward its goal on Monday, when it plans to announce video- and news-subscription services that it hopes will generate billions of dollars in new annual revenue and deepen ties between iPhone users and the company.
In some ways, Apple helped create its own predicament when it launched the app industry a decade ago. The goal was to make the iPhone more powerful.
Over time, though, apps and services, from Spotify to Netflix to China's WeChat, have often become more important to users than the devices that run them. That allows consumers to hold on to phones longer or switch to less expensive versions. In January, Apple reported its first decline in revenue and profit for a holiday quarter in over a decade.
Revenue from the services business grew 33% last year, to nearly $40 billion -- about 15% of the company's total of $265.6 billion.
The company's ambition in video is to become an alternative to cable, combining original series with shows from other networks to create a new entertainment service that can reach more than 100 markets world-wide. It is the tech giant's latest attempt to reinvent television, something it has tried for about a decade with limited success.
On Monday, the tech giant plans to unveil the first footage from some of its new original TV shows, according to people familiar with the event. Apple has used a $1 billion budget to buy dozens of original TV shows in hopes it can land a breakout hit. It has cut deals with Hollywood stars including actor Reese Witherspoon and director J.J. Abrams, who have been invited to attend Monday's event on Apple's campus, according to those people.
Apple declined to comment.
Apple hasn't said what it will charge for the programming. People working on the projects said the company plans to charge a fee, after previously saying it would be free to Apple device owners.
The original series will be delivered in a new TV app that staff have been calling a Netflix killer. It will make it easier for people to subscribe with a single click to channels such as Starz, Showtime and HBO, with which Apple has been negotiating to offer their shows to users for $9.99 a month each, people familiar with the talks said.
Apple has been negotiating to bring its new TV app to multiple platforms, including Roku and smart TVs, according to people familiar with the talks -- an unusual move for a company that has long preferred to limit its software and services to its own devices. Some of those agreements are expected to be announced Monday.
At the same event, Apple plans to showcase a revamped News app that includes a premium tier with access to more than 200 magazines -- including Bon Appetit, People and Glamour -- as well as newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal. It plans to charge $9.99 for the service and believes the premium content can lift engagement on its devices, people familiar with the plans said. The New York Times reported on the Journal's participation.
As part of the arrangement, much of the Journal's content will be available through the service, although certain types of stories -- particularly general news, politics and lifestyles news -- will be showcased, while business and finance news won't be displayed as prominently, according to people familiar with the situation. The deal will result in the Journal hiring more reporters focused on general news to help feed Apple's product, one of the people said. The Journal sells its own subscriptions for $39 a month.
The news subscription offering follows Apple's 2018 acquisition of a Netflix-for-news app called Texture. The deal gave Apple rights to most major North American magazines for at least five years and up to two decades in an agreement that splits revenue 50-50 between the tech giant and publishers such as Hearst Magazines and Conde Nast, according to people familiar with the deal.
The terms rankled some newspapers Apple courted, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which sell monthly subscriptions for $15 and $10, respectively. The Washington Post and New York Times aren't participating in the new app, according to people familiar with the situation.
When Apple last found itself on the ropes in the early 2000s, co-founder Steve Jobs reinvented the company by pushing it into mobile devices. The iPod and its accompanying iTunes service revived a company that was largely dependent on Mac computer sales. The subsequent iPhone helped Apple become the first company to surpass $1 trillion in market value last year.
Mr. Cook is attempting a similar feat in the approaching twilight of the smartphone era. He began pushing the services strategy hard in late 2017, after Apple launched its 10th-anniversary smartphone, the iPhone X. While a big price increase to nearly $1,000 was helping boost revenue, the iPhone X wasn't selling more phones, and higher prices made sophisticated, lower-cost rival devices more appealing.
Mr. Cook, who had vowed earlier that year to double Apple's services revenue by 2020, began meeting regularly with the services division.
At the monthly sessions, the 58-year-old CEO has peppered the team with questions. He wanted services team members to tell him which apps were selling well, how many Apple Music subscribers stuck with the service, and how many people were signing up for iCloud storage, a costly service that required spending billions of dollars to build data centers around the U.S., according to people familiar with the meetings.
"You couldn't say, 'I don't have that information. I'll get that tonight,' " said one person involved. "You had to have a dictionary of backup."
Apple's biggest source of services revenue comes from distributing other companies' software through its App Store. The company is now battling Spotify and Netflix, two of the most popular apps, over its practice of taking 30% of sales or subscription revenue from apps.
Netflix recently stopped letting users sign up for its service on Apple devices, and said it won't participate in Apple's video subscription service. Spotify AB this month filed an antitrust complaint in Europe claiming Apple abuses its control over the App Store, something Apple denies.
Apple's music-streaming service, its biggest attempt so far to build its own subscription business, has about 50 million global subscribers -- far behind Spotify's 96 million.
Apple's base of 1.4 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs in use globally gives it a distribution platform. Yet the businesses of selling gadgets and services can conflict. To reach the biggest possible market for video service, Apple would have to offer it on non-Apple devices -- something it has been loath to do in years past.
Previous successes with services such as iTunes, which redefined the music industry, have been offset by troubles with Maps and Siri.
"They built an organization to make beautiful gadgets and compete with Samsung and other gray-box manufacturers," said Mike Levin, co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology analysis firm. "Now, they have to really think about the services and software that have been so uneven and compete with a lot of very different competitors."
Mr. Cook has said Apple retains its edge. "Apple innovates like no other company on Earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas," he told investors in January, when Apple reported earnings.
Apple's stock, while up since early January, remains 20% below its peak in October. It is currently valued at $900.85 billion.
Co-founder Mr. Jobs foreshadowed Apple's services future when he started iTunes in 2001, offering categories from competing major labels to make the first successful digital-music store, with songs available for 99 cents.
When Apple created the iPhone in 2007, Mr. Jobs opposed letting other companies sell apps for it, fearing they could undercut performance or introduce viruses.
Apple's software team, recognizing that more apps could make the phone more dynamic, pushed back and prevailed. The resulting App Store has generated more than $120 billion in total sales for developers since it opened in 2008.
It also brought competition from rivals such as Spotify, which began selling subscriptions in the U.S. in 2011.
The competition led to Apple's biggest deal, its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics LLC in 2014, so Apple could launch a competing music-streaming service.
By then, concerns had already been rising inside Apple about the iPhone's future. The number of devices Apple sold was growing more than 20% annually as Mr. Cook pushed it into new retailers and markets, but sales executives told colleagues in 2014 they were running out of avenues for easy growth, former employees said. "They were freaked out," one person said.
Apple wanted a service that could beat Netflix, a person familiar with the company's plan said. After a 2015 effort to persuade Walt Disney Co. and others to join a streaming-TV service faltered, Apple's executives debated alternatives, including acquiring Walt Disney Co. or Netflix, and building its own studio, people familiar with the discussions said.
In 2017, it hired two prominent executives from Sony Pictures Television and empowered them to cut deals for more than two dozen original programs. They scooped up a reboot of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television's "Amazing Stories," scored a series about a morning talk show starring Ms. Witherspoon, and struck a partnership with Oprah Winfrey.
Apple faces steep competition from big spenders while it plays catch-up to experienced rivals. Netflix has 139 million subscribers and is expected to spend $15 billion on content this year. It also offers a far deeper content library than Apple plans to make available. Disney, which has decades of experience making hit shows and movies, plans to launch its own streaming service later this year.
Previously, Apple used software and services to sell more of its own devices. In January, Apple announced it would put a TV app on sets made by rival Samsung Electronics Co., making it available to people who don't necessarily own any Apple hardware.
Apple executives made clear during talks with TV makers that it needed as broad a reach as possible to compete with Netflix and others. Last year, Apple announced a similar agreement with rival Amazon.com Inc. to bring Apple Music to Echo smart speakers.
The push into news subscriptions could help Apple battle Facebook Inc., whose News Feed has helped it become the No. 1 app world-wide in monthly active smartphone users. It is also the anchor of a business that Facebook is looking to expand by emphasizing private messaging, a step many interpret as the first in an effort to become a super-app like China's WeChat, which allows users to shop, order food, buy movie tickets and make reservations on any mobile operating system.
For Mr. Cook's monthly services meetings, the company has intensified monitoring of apps that benefit and threaten Apple. The team has created a release radar for the CEO to track apps that are expected to sell well and other metrics for the apps that have challenged Apple's business, said the person involved with the meetings.
Other successful subscription apps have given away much more content at lower prices than Apple is expected to offer initially. Amazon Prime members, who pay $119 annually, get free video content and discounted music subscriptions. Some inside Apple's services group wanted similar benefits for iPhone buyers. Mr. Cook and his leadership team have made it clear that its forthcoming services will carry a price tag.

Texto completo: Ride-hailing startup Lyft is planning to tap the public markets next week, which should be a good moment for the company and investors. But Lyft's plan for dual-class voting shares has kicked up a fuss from pension funds, which means it's time to explain again that corporate governance is not a one-man, one-vote democracy.
The seven-year-old Silicon Valley startup on Monday disclosed more information regarding its initial public offering next week that aims to raise $2 billion at a targeted $23 billion valuation. Co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer will receive 20 votes per share while other common stockholders will get one-for-one. This structure will let the founders control nearly a majority of votes with only 7% of shares.
This is not a new idea. About 10% of public companies including Google, Berkshire Hathaway and Levi Strauss boast dual-class shares that give insiders or family owners corporate control. Facebook insiders including CEO Mark Zuckerberg get 10 votes per share. The Murdoch family controls News Corp (which owns the Wall Street Journal) with a dual-class structure, as the Sulzbergers do the New York Times.
Dual-class structures are becoming more popular as founders seek to retain control after their companies go public. Last year 34.2% of tech companies that went public included dual-class shares. This structure can liberate entrepreneurs to absorb short-term losses while pursuing a longer-term vision. It also makes acquisitions easier.
The complaint, especially from large institutional investors, is that dual-class shares allow founders to have it both ways: They get access to capital markets without relinquishing control. Management that is less accountable to public shareholders may pursue strategies that produce lower returns and reduce the stock value over time.
This is a legitimate concern, but it also has a ready solution: Don't invest in companies with dual-class structures. Every investor in Facebook knows that the investment risk includes Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership as well as his management. The stock structure isn't a secret at any of these public companies.
The critics also dislike dual-class shares because they reduce the influence of institutional investors with management. Union pension funds can't as easily use proxy votes to advance politically motivated initiatives such as "say on pay" or climate-change disclosures. Senator Elizabeth Warren in 2013 urged major stock exchanges to block dual-class companies that she claimed deprive "millions of retirees and workers" of their "basic rights."
The Council of Institutional Investors has also pushed exchanges and stock-tracking indexes to exclude companies with multiple voting classes. The S&P Dow Jones Indices two years ago decided to do so in the future for companies floating shares, and a large-scale index fund boycott could hurt a company's stock price.
All of this pressure is now descending on Lyft, which will need big institutional investors to achieve its IPO goals. "As Lyft issues more shares in the future, this misalignment of control and cash flow would be magnified," says a letter to Lyft from a group of pension funds that control about $3.2 trillion in assets. "Potential Lyft shareholders cannot ignore the risk this stark misalignment poses to their investment going forward."
Well, fine. Then don't play in Lyft's IPO. Uber is planning to go public later this year, and it has limited super-voting shares after private investors complained they gave too much control and latitude to founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick. Invest in Uber instead.
Many investors may actually prefer that Lyft's founders exercise more control over the company than pension funds or proxy firms that direct the votes of many institutional investors. Labor groups may also have political motives that conflict with the founders' goals. The Teamsters, which signed the pension-fund letter, may oppose Lyft's autonomous car initiative because it eliminates drivers.
The beauty of U.S. capital markets is that investors who don't like how companies operate can vote with their wallet.

AJC PERFORMING ARTS 'ANGRY, RAUCOUS AND SHAMELESSLY GORGEOUS': Inspired by life: Pearl Cleage's new play takes on aging and generation wars.

Texto completo: Pearl Cleage understands how Southerners use honorifics to show respect for elders.
She knows that "ma'am," drawled a certain way, shows deference, and that, these days, when younger black people say "Auntie" before uttering an elder black woman's first name, it's a form of veneration.
But now that she is 70, those good intentions are little comfort.
"People will call me now Miss Pearl because it says, 'This is an older woman. We love her, but we're respectful. So, we're not going to call her Pearl.We call her Mama Pearl," Cleage said. "All of that elder stuff, I'm like, 'What are you talking about? That's my grandmother, not me.'"
In her latest play for the Alliance Theatre, "Angry, Raucous and Shamelessly Gorgeous," Cleage explores what it means to be an older woman in contemporary culture, a culture in which women become less celebrated and more invisible as they age. The play, which opened on March 20, also lays bare the tension between baby boomers and millennials and asks questions about that relationship. Among them: When is it time to pass the torch? Is it arrogant of an older generation to even think it has the authority to do so? And should a younger generation pay any obeisance to elder trailblazers?
'I've Lived Longer'
Cleage has been a playwright-in-residence at the Alliance for the past eight years. It's an important berth for a black female dramatist in a field where, apart from black theaters, African Americans can struggle to get their stories told on prominent regional stages. Then there's the birthday factor: Cleage finds herself in an even smaller club--African-American female playwrights over 50 whose scripts are produced by major theaters. It is a lonely distinction Cleage has grown used to. So, she creates characters that reflect the world as it could be.
In her early work as an essayist and later as a New York Times best-selling novelist and now, Cleage tells the stories of black women--how they deal with class, empowerment, health crises, the changing political climate. They are her stories, issues that have affected either her or those she has known. It tracks, then, that as she enters this stage of her career, aging is a theme. Her 2018 play, "Pointing at the Moon," reprised a character she created 30 years ago for another drama called "Hospice." Instead of picking up where she left the character, pregnant and 30 years old, Cleage reintroduced her in "Pointing at the Moon" as a 60-yearold woman reflecting on her life choices.
"The things I'm writing about now are not the same things I was writing about when I was 30, because I wasn't thinking about mortality," Cleage said. "I was thinking about falling in love and having babies and being a fabulous feminist woman. Now what I'm thinking about is very different because I've lived longer."
And yet, "Angry, Raucous," is more "inspired by," than "true story." It centers on Anna, a radical, feminist actress in her mid-60s, who, for nearly 35 years, has been living in Amsterdam, estranged from the U.S. theater community since she performed "Naked Wilson," a piece critical of African-American playwright August Wilson. While standing naked, center stage, at a black theater festival, Anna rendered monologues by male characters from Wilson's classic plays. The show was a commentary on the centrality of black men in Wilson's work, while female characters stood in the margins.
Afterward, Anna couldn't get work and had to go abroad. "Angry, Raucous" is set in the present, when Anna and her manager are invited to Atlanta for a commemorative performance of her vintage piece.
Anna is ready for the challenge: She has been working out, studying her lines. But as the performance nears, Anna meets Pete, an actress too young to know who Anna is, but old enough to see "Naked Wilson," as an opportunity.
The baby boomer and millennial are suspicious and dismissive of each other. The plot is not quite "All About Eve," the classic Bette Davis film about a veteran actress and the calculating young newcomer who wants to take her place. Yet, Cleage lays bare the fear a woman experiences as the person staring back at her in the mirror looks less like what's in her mind's eye. That the person in the mirror still has the passion and hunger of her younger self only makes the physical changes more difficult to bear.
"The thing I think is so hard is not only does it seem to come overnight -- like all of us were 35 and then we're 60, which, of course, is not true; you get there every day -- but that fear (is there) because you realize that there are fewer years in front of you then there are behind you," Cleage said. 'Out Here Glowing'
Novelist Tayari Jones met Cleage, the woman who would become her mentor, when she was a student in the playwright's class at Spelman College. Fast forward 30 years and now Jones is a New York Times best-selling author herself. Her latest novel, "An American Marriage," was an Oprah Book Club pick last year and has been optioned for film adaptation. She's on talk shows, book tour and has a huge Twitter following.
Cleage's novel, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day," was an Oprah Book Club pick exactly 20 years before Jones'.Her play, "Hospice" had an award-winning off-Broadway run. And among the ever-influential circuit of African-American women's book clubs, Cleage has been a favorite for decades.
Jones, 48, said she considers her former instructor as much a friend as an adviser. The women have remained close for years. When they are together, the affection and admiration between them is apparent.
So, about that torch.
"The way that we do it (is) that we each respect the other's experience," Jones wrote in an email interview. " But for us, it's like she extended her torch so I could light mine. We're both out here glowing! She has always generously shared the wisdom of her experiences and, in return, I help her navigate the changing world of writing and publishing -- and the internet! Pearl has institutional memory -- she is a witness to, and a participant in, the history of Atlanta and the history of this country. But I also value her day-to-day experiences. I want to talk to her about whatever happened to her just yesterday!"
Intergenerational friendships can be tricky. Things can go along fine, then one party says something that strikes the other as naive or antiquated. Given the right set of circumstances, admiration can morph into pity. Cleage said such friendships abide only if each party puts in the work to respect the other's experiences and choices, which is not always easy. Especially when it comes to music.
She listened to rapper Cardi B around the time she was working on "Angry, Raucous," because she wanted to understand the world of the play's youngest character, Pete. Cardi's lyrics were raw in a way Smokey Robinson's never were. The 26-year-old rapper's music wasn't for Cleage, but she wasn't about to dismiss the the Grammy Award-winning artist either.
"I am as convinced as I've ever been convinced of anything that these young women are building on what we gave them because we became feminist women. We became free women.We interrogated all those old ideas about women and what we could do and what we could not do," Cleage said.
Things continue to change. Of the top 10 most-produced plays of the 2018-2019 season nationally, two are by African-American women playwrights, Lynne Nottage and Dominique Morisseau, according to American Theatre magazine. And of the top 20 most-produced playwrights during the same period, three are black women, including Nottage, Morisseau and Christina Ham. Of the three, Nottage is the only one over 50.
"While we have worked with mature female writers of color in the past, I wouldn't say it happens frequently, and I would say that is sadly atypical to do so in our field," said Alliance Artistic Director Susan V. Booth.
But the ranks of young, black women playwrights penning important scripts are swelling, albeit slowly; Ham, Morisseau and actress Danai Gurira among them. As the veteran, Cleage views them as reinforcements rather than challengers. Her 40-year career has been prolific and she sees no reason why that should change. She knows she has earned the stories she's telling, day by day, year by year.
"You have to be the best 60, you have to be the best 65, and you have to be the best 70, but you got to be in that moment," Cleage said. "You can't be trying to go backward. Go forward. You got to make peace with this moment."
To that, those coming up behind her might say, "Yes, ma'am."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Look at the losers running, or considering a run, for the Democratic presidential nomination.
I don’t mean that pejoratively. I mean it literally.
Beto O’Rourke’s presidential candidacy is the ultimate expression of the participation trophy culture on the left. It used to be you had to win on the state level before taking the national stage. Barack Obama won a Senate seat from Illinois before immediately declaring his intention to run for president. At the time, that was considered pretty audacious. He hadn’t accomplished anything in the Senate before he decided on a presidential run. But at least he won. O’Rourke lost his race to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, last year. He got a participation trophy. Apparently, he thinks that qualifies him to be the leader of the free world.
Well, he must have some accomplishments other than almost winning a Senate seat, right? Not really. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was flummoxed when asked what O’Rourke had accomplished in Congress, saying he “brought a great deal of vitality” to his work “preserving our planet and protecting our people.” (In fact, O’Rourke passed a single bill, H.R. 5873, which renamed a courthouse in his hometown of El Paso.) Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa was questioned by Ed Henry on Fox News, “What would you say is Beto O’Rourke’s top accomplishment that he brings to the table?” Hinojosa could not name a single one. “I’m not even talking about Congress,” Henry said. “What has he done in his life?” “Your question is meaningless,” Hinojosa replied.
So, if O’Rourke hasn’t accomplished anything, he must at least have some clear ideas of what he wants to accomplish in the Oval Office, right? Nope. The Post reports that “unlike candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who launched their campaigns with clearly articulated policy platforms, O’Rourke focuses more on sweeping calls for unity and pitching himself as the best antidote to the country’s toxic politics.” The motivation for his run, apparently, is him. As Vanity Fair’s Joe Hagan explains in a recent profile, O’Rourke “can’t deny the pull of his own gifts.” He tells a reporter, “Man, I’m just born to be in it.”
He’s not the only statewide loser taking the national stage. Stacey Abrams lost the governor’s race in Georgia in 2018, yet national Democrats tapped her to deliver the official rebuttal to the State of the Union — a task normally given to those who actually won their races. And now, The Post reports, she is considering a race for president as well. “I think that I am a skilled communicator,” she said. “I think I’m a very good thinker. No, I know I’m a good thinker. I know I have policy chops. I have foreign policy experience.”
Foreign policy experience? She served as minority leader of the state House of Representatives. Her official bio lists her as “former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations” (a temporary membership for young people) as well as “a Council on Italy Fellow, a British-American Project Fellow, a Salzburg Seminar-Freeman Fellow on U.S.-East Asian Relations, a Salzburg Seminar Fellow on youth and civic engagement and a Yukos Fellow for U.S.-Russian Relations.” That might qualify her for an entry-level job at a left-wing think tank, but it hardly qualifies her to be commander in chief. Even O’Rourke can claim experience on the House Armed Services Committee.
Democrats point out that President Trump had never won statewide office before running for president. That’s true. But he also had not run for state office and lost. He ran as a successful outsider, not as a failed insider. And unlike O’Rourke, he had actual accomplishments — including a multibillion-dollar real estate empire.
This is not to dismiss O’Rourke’s chances. He raised a whopping $6.1 million in his first 24 hours as a candidate, just edging out Sanders’s first day haul of almost $6 million. That is the best of any Democrat running for president so far. As the New York Times noted, “In a single day online, he raised nearly a quarter of what Barack Obama, then a senator, did in the entire first quarter of 2007.”
Apparently, Democrats like losers. We’ll soon see if one can win the presidency.

Texto completo: Ironworker half caff
Five years ago, Shane Galloway was roasting coffee for himself, and for his friends. When he couldn't keep up with the demand, he figured it was time to make his hobby into a business. So, four years ago, 4AM Coffee Roasters was born in downtown Carrollton, and Galloway turned a dough-nut shop into a coffee shop plus farm-to-table breakfast-lunch-dinner cafe. He's roasting his coffee in an air roaster, rather than a drum roaster, so the beans "float" in a stream of hot air as they heat. Bits of chaff from the coffee bean
Big Bang blend
The New York Times described Alfred Peet as "the Dutch coffee merchant who pioneered a revolution that led to America's love affair with high-end coffee." Peet's first shop in Berkeley, California, which opened in 1966, was ground zero for understanding that it matters where coffee is grown. He was generous with his expertise, and Starbucks co-founder Jerry Baldwin credits Peet for teaching him how to cup, roast and blend. Peet's started in California, but now has 400 coffee bars across the country,
Chocolate-covered coffee beans
I don't know about you, but coffee and chocolate are my very favorite flavor combination. And, while mocha drinks are fine, chocolate-covered coffee beans are even better. No cup required, just grab a handful! Atlanta's classic coffee roaster, J. Martinez &Co.,was founded in 1988 by Jamaica native John Martinez. He offered his customers the chance to purchase "estate" coffee, sourced from individual husks that would make the coffee bitter blow away. For those times when you don't want a fully caffeinated day,
and Peet's coffee is available in grocery stores across metro Atlanta.We tried their Big Bang blend, named after
coffee estates.It was pretty revolutionary at the time.One ofthe coffees thecompany has try his Ironworker blend. It's a half caff combination of waterprocesseddecaffeinatedSumatran
coffee beans with natural processed Ethiopian beans. The natural process means the beans are dried with the fruit (called the coffee "cherry")on the beans, and the resulting coffee really does taste fruity and smooth. His Etsy shop offers eight fully caffeinated coffees as well. Buy a bag of coffee at the shop, and they'll brew you a cup for free.
$12 per 12-ounce bag. Available at the shop, 105 N. Park Street, Carrollton, or at etsy.com/shop/4AMCoffeeRoasters.
a quote from former Atlanta magazine dining critic Corby Kummer, saying Peet "was the big bang. It all started with him." This is a medium roast coffee that includes natural processed Ethiopian beans, which give it a sweetness we really liked. We also like their limited-release Anniversary blend, with beans from Colombia and Rwanda -- rich and delicious.
Big Bang is $15.95 per pound. Available at Publix, Whole Foods, Kroger and Target. Anniversary Blend is $19.95 per pound. Available at peets.com.

chocolate-covered treat. The dark chocolate version is their best seller, but there's also a milk chocolate version that will appeal to those who want a milder chocolate experience.Chocolate-covered coffee beans for your Easter basket this year?

Kushner Scales Back in City

Texto completo: Kushner Cos. left its suburban roots behind years ago to pursue big property investments in New York City. Now, under fire from New York politicians and tenant activists, it is increasingly turning back to the 'burbs.
The firm has sold 10 properties for more than $1.5 billion in New York and was the buyer of one since January 2017, according to Real Capital Analytics. That is when then-Chief Executive Jared Kushner left to join the White House as President Trump's senior adviser.
Over this same period, the firm has spent more than $1.4 billion in a series of transactions for properties primarily in suburban Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and other states, RCA data shows.
This month, Kushner Cos. hired a broker to market five apartment buildings with a total of around 100 units in Manhattan's East Village, according to people familiar with the agreement.
Mr. Kushner sold his stake in many of his family holdings to a trust controlled by family members to avoid potential conflicts. But that has done little to ease the public and media scrutiny the firm has received while President Trump has been in the White House. Mr. Kushner is married to Ivanka Trump, one of the president's daughters, who also works as a senior administration official.
The company sold a development site in Brooklyn last April after local City Council member Brad Lander indicated he would oppose the area's proposed rezoning if Kushner Cos. could benefit. Mr. Kushner could exert influence over federal funds to clean up the Gowanus Canal and financially benefit himself once a rezoning made large-scale development possible, Mr. Lander argued in a 2017 radio interview.
An uproar came early in the Trump administration after media reports that Jared's father, Charles Kushner, was negotiating with China's Anbang Insurance Co. to step in as a partner on a $7.5 billion plan to redevelop 666 Fifth Ave. Anbang, which has had close political and family ties to top Chinese officials and is now controlled by the government, backed out of those talks after they became publicized.
New York city council member Ritchie Torres introduced a bill to close what he called the "Kushner loophole," which he claimed allows landlords to file inaccurate city disclosures without repercussions. The pro-tenant group Housing Rights Initiative had accused the company of falsely claiming to not have any rent-stabilized tenants at 34 properties, which Mr. Torres and other critics say allowed it to avoid stricter oversight. The company at the time said that clerical mistakes were made by a third party and corrected once identified.
Kushner President Laurent Morali said in an email that, while the company has been a "net seller" of New York City property since 2017, "we remain bullish on the city's future" and remain active as a lender. "Our company's investment and disposition philosophy is mainly driven by our objective to maximize returns," he said.
Some Democrats and other critics of the administration say this stepped up attention to Kushner Cos. is likely to persist -- even intensify -- as the progressive wing of the party exerts more power.
"Kushner, because of his proximity to Trump, is a target," said George Arzt, a Democratic strategist.
Kushner Cos. isn't the only one selling New York properties, where prices ran up in the years after the downturn. Many investors have been cooling on rental apartments amid growing antilandlord sentiment. Elected officials, including some moderates, have been voicing support for increasing taxes on owners and even imposing new restrictions on rent increases, pushing down values.
Even with the recent sales and its plan to sell another 100 apartment units in the East Village, Kushner Cos. still owns a sizable portfolio in New York City. That includes apartment buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn, a downtown office building, a lending business and the lower floors of the former New York Times building.
But Kushner is unique in the scrutiny the family has come under in a city that is fiercely anti-Trump. "There's no separation here between Jared Kushner and the company in the eyes of progressive politicians, who are increasingly powerful in this city," Mr. Arzt said.
Kushner Cos. started off as a builder of suburban apartments in New Jersey. In 2007, the company sold off more than half of its holdings and bought 666 Fifth Avenue for $1.8 billion, a record price in Manhattan at the time.
Over the following years it added more properties in New York City. By early 2017, the company was planning a $7.5 billion redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue, and working on a 1.1-million-square-foot luxury apartment project in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood, and an office redevelopment around the corner.
It has since leased 666 Fifth Ave. to Brookfield Asset Management and sold its stakes in the two big Brooklyn projects. Kushner is no longer involved in any large-scale development projects in New York City.

Texto completo: After years of declining readership and endless newsroom cuts, the new owner of the Los Angeles Times is setting a high target in his effort to turn the company around.
Biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, who acquired the long-struggling paper in June from Tribune Publishing Co. for $500 million, said the Times needs to build its digital-subscriber base to five million paying customers.
"I have made a decision to invest what it will take to make sure that the Los Angeles Times remains a viable business for at least another 100 years," Dr. Soon-Shiong said in an interview. "If we get to five million ultimately, that will make that possible."
The target is no small task, as the Times now has 150,000 digital-only subscribers, the company said -- almost double what it had when Dr. Soon-Shiong took over.
Dr. Soon-Shiong didn't set a timeline for achieving the goal, but pointed to the digital-subscriber growth numbers posted by the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as proof that it is possible.
He said he envisioned the L.A. Times as a kind of superregional news source, with its primary focus on being the paper of record for California's 40 million residents, rather than trying to compete directly for a national audience with the New York Times or Washington Post.
But he also wanted to expand the L.A. Times's audience reach into Mexico, western Canada and across the Pacific Rim, as well as into surrounding states.
Dr. Soon-Shiong's ambitious digital-subscriber goal is just one step in a broader turnaround effort.
He said he had already invested an additional $150 million into the company since closing the deal to acquire the Los Angeles Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and a string of southern California community papers last summer.
The money has primarily gone to rebuilding the Times newsroom, which has grown to 525 employees from around 400.
There also has been significant investment in technology and the creation of a new 10-acre campus that now serves as the Times headquarters after the paper last summer moved out of its historic downtown building.
An inventor of cancer drugs and a biotech investor worth $7 billion, according to Forbes, Dr. Soon-Shiong said he now considered rebuilding the Times his primary occupation.
Dr. Soon-Shiong's purchase of the newspaper followed years of turmoil at the storied paper since it was acquired by Tribune's predecessor company in 2000.
He said the reliance on digital-audience growth for sustainability has been made necessary by what he called the "unfair usurpation" of advertising revenue by giant tech platforms such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.
"They freely use all the amazing journalism work being produced locally, regionally and nationally while drawing away the revenue stream," he said. "At some point, something will have to be done to address that, because it has become an unfair breach of the infrastructure of democracy."
A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.
Google has said it was committed to helping publishers succeed in increasing their online advertising revenue and expand their other lines of business.
Dr. Soon-Shiong also said he remains committed to producing a print product for the foreseeable future, despite circulation that has fallen 68% in the past decade on weekdays to 233,000, and 54% on Sunday to 477,000, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.
"We will be the last man standing when it comes to print," he said.

Texto completo: Desiree Akhavan's "The Miseducation of Cameron Post" is on HBO. And Patricia Arquette stars in a new true-crime anthology series on Hulu.
What's on TV
THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST (2018) 9:45 p.m. on HBO. The actress Chloë Grace Moretz portrayed two characters in punishing settings last year. In Luca Guadagnino's "Suspiria," she played a student missing from a backbreaking West Berlin dance academy. And she played the title character in this movie, directed by Desiree Akhavan and based on a young-adult novel by Emily Danforth. Set in the early 1990s, the film centers on Cameron, an 11th-grader whose family sends her to a boarding school for anti-gay "conversion therapy." The story follows Cameron as she befriends Jane (Sasha Lane) and Adam (Forrest Goodluck), two other teenagers in the program who rebel, in part, by way of a makeshift pot farm squirreled away in the woods. Though the film doesn't let those running the school, including the headmistress (played by Jennifer Ehle) and her brother (John Gallagher Jr.), off the hook, it takes pains to paint a morally complex picture. Akhavan "steers away from cliché, and the cast avoids caricature," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "There is a delicate humanism at work here that feels especially refreshing, a commitment to respecting differences without sacrificing a clear ethical point of view."
O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000) 5:30 p.m. on AMC. When the soundtrack to this Coen brothers fable was released in 2000, Daniel Menaker wrote in The Times that it "has to be one of the least mainstream Hollywood soundtracks ever offered for sale." With modern recordings of traditional American music performed by the likes of Alison Krauss and Emmylou Harris, the soundtrack, produced by T Bone Burnett, added to the dusty period feel of this Depression-era comedy, a reimagining of Homer's "The Odyssey." George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson star as convicts whose sordid adventures include becoming folk singers.
BUBLÉ! 10 p.m. on NBC. The dusty prison stripes worn by the singing convicts of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" are a shabby sight next to the crisp suit and tie worn by Michael Bublé in this new special, which pairs the crooner with a 36-piece orchestra. He performs songs from his recent album, "Love," alongside standards like "My Funny Valentine" and "Fly Me to the Moon."
What's Streaming
THE ACT Stream on Hulu. The first season of this new true-crime anthology series stars Patricia Arquette as Dee Dee Blanchard, a Missouri mother whose bizarre, abusive relationship with her daughter, Gypsy Rose (Joey King), culminated in murder. Chloë Sevigny plays the Blanchards' neighbor. The case was the subject of an HBO documentary in 2017; the telling here, created by Nick Antosca (showrunner of "Channel Zero") and the journalist Michelle Dean (who covered the Blanchard tragedy for Buzzfeed News) leans into the more surreal elements of the case, and draws out intense performances from its leads.

Wells Fargo faces trouble on Capitol Hill

Texto completo: For Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, it was a virtual no-win scenario.

Summoned by the House Financial Services Committee to testify about the San Francisco-based lender's ongoing regulatory issues, he contended with repeated suggestions from Democrats, who now control the chamber, that Wells Fargo has become "too big to manage," a thinly veiled reference to the 2008 financial crisis, when bailed-out banks were criticized as "too big to fail."

From the Republican side of the aisle, meanwhile, his company was lambasted for scandals that have fueled enthusiasm for splitting up large financial institutions as the 2020 presidential campaign gets under way.

"The bank’s actions have given a voice to those who want to unfairly taint the reputation of the entire banking sector," Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., told Sloan. "Your bank’s misconduct has fueled the kind of unfair hyperbolic and anti-bank rhetoric you will hear today, which threatens access to capital, job creation, and economic growth."

The third-largest bank in the U.S., Wells Fargo's fortunes have seen a dramatic decline since it reaped kudos in the aftermath of the financial crisis for sufficient strength that it didn't require a bailout, unlike rivals Citigroup and Bank of America.

The spiral dates to at least 2016, when Wells Fargo paid $185 million to settle claims that employees struggling to meet aggressive targets, which included selling as many as eight different products to each customer household, had created millions of unauthorized customer accounts.

The revelations and the fiery congressional hearings afterward spurred the departure of then-CEO John Stumpf, whom Sloan replaced. The bank also lost a number of lucrative government projects and grappled with customer and shareholder lawsuits and a string of hefty fines from regulators.

As recently as February, insurers for current and former Wells Fargo leadership, from Sloan himself to board members, agreed to pay $240 million to settle investor lawsuits claiming they didn't live up to their responsibilities to prevent the fake-accounts scandal.

In December, the company agreed to pay $575 million to resolve claims with prosecutors in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., related to both the phony accounts and issues in its auto- and mortgage-lending businesses. Before that, the bank shelled out $1 billion to settle government claims it sold some auto borrowers insurance they didn't need under the pretense they might not qualify for their loans otherwise and charged fees to mortgage customers that it was supposed to be absorbing. In August, the bank said it would pay $2.09 billion to settle Justice Department allegations that the bank packaged mortgages that were higher risk than they appeared into securities sold before the financial crisis.

Perhaps the most significant action, over the long term, was the Federal Reserve's 2018 order barring the bank from expanding its total assets beyond the amount held at the end of 2017 until it resolves the regulator's oversight concerns.

"This punishment and the fines imposed have not changed the bank’s behavior," said Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who stepped into her current role when her party regained a majority in the House after November's midterm elections.

"Wells Fargo’s ongoing lawlessness and failure to right the ship suggest the bank, with approximately $1.9 trillion in assets and serving one in three U.S. households, is simply too big to manage," she added during the March 12 hearing.

Rep. Stephen Lynch made a similar argument. "If I were you, and you really wanted to do the right thing, put this bank on the right path: Break it up," the Massachusetts Democrat told Sloan.

"Decide how you would dismantle it, so we don’t lose all the jobs," he added. "You're way too big. Your conduct has been disgraceful, and I think you would serve your customers and you would serve the financial system and our country much better if you agreed to just break up the bank in functioning pieces that are able to be accountable to their customers and to the general public."

GOP lawmakers, who not infrequently disagreed with Democratic claims that Wells Fargo's size was the root of its problems, offered Sloan opportunities to counter those arguments.

While companies "must be held accountable when they're scamming hard-working Americans," breaking up large banks can damage the economy, said Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, who cited comments from former President Barack Obama to back up his point.

In an April 2016 interview with the New York Times, Obama conceded Sen. Bernie Sanders, a presidential candidate then and now, was correct to say that his administration hadn't broken up large banks or dismantled the financial system.

“But one of the things that I’ve consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is not an abstraction," Obama told the Times. "It’s not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences.”

Sloan, like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose bank is the largest U.S. lender, agreed that breaking up large financial institutions doesn't make sense.

Nonetheless, "I also believe that no bank is too big to fail, if they don’t operate in an appropriate way," he said.

Breaking up giant financial institutions has been a rallying cry for critics like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who wants her party's nomination to run against President Trump in 2020 and believes the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was a mistake. The Depression-era law required the separation of securities-trading businesses from consumer banks handling federally insured deposits.

Splitting up Wells Fargo would ultimately hurt access to capital for U.S. entrepreneurs, Sloan maintained. "There's a place in this country, and we see that today, for community banks, for medium-size banks, and for large banks," he said. "We can invest billions of dollars in products and services that sometimes our small and medium-size competitors can't."

It's unlikely that argument will satisfy Warren, who has previously introduced a Senate bill bringing back Glass-Steagall and suggested that the Fed not lift its growth cap until Sloan is replaced.

"Do you realize if someone on Main Street caused such hazardous results, whether it was stealing their money or conning them, they'd go to jail?" Rep. Gregory Meeks asked Sloan. "At your bank, that you've been a part of for 31 years, no one has paid a punishment at all. People have left; some still received a bonus; people have stayed as you have and got promoted. When the general public looks at this, they do not see any justice at all. Nothing."

The criticism both Sloan and his bank faced wasn't limited to Capitol Hill. Shortly after the hearing ended, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the company's regulators, reaffirmed its dissatisfaction.

“We continue to be disappointed with Wells Fargo Bank N.A.’s performance under our consent orders and its inability to execute effective corporate governance and a successful risk management program," agency spokesman Bryan Hubbard said in a statement. "We expect national banks to treat their customers fairly, operate in a safe and sound manner, and follow the rules of law. “

Such a public rebuke is unusual, even when regulators are unhappy with a CEO's public statements or testimony, and may signal that Wells Fargo is already subject to a confidential enforcement action, said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group, which has tracked federal policy for the past four decades.

JPMorgan operated under one, which prevented its expansion into new markets, for five years, and the action was only made public when it was rescinded, Seiberg noted.

Wells Fargo's "troubles in Washington appear to still be getting worse rather than improving," he said. "And that would suggest the bank will be limited in how it can grow and operate for the foreseeable future. Prospects for escaping this scrutiny earlier are low."

Texto completo: Like those of his recent predecessors, President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for the fiscal year that starts in October will not be adopted by Congress. Still, a presidential budget plan is an important indicator of the administration’s priorities.
The Trump administration’s priority for health is for the federal government to spend less. In some cases much less, as evidenced by its proposed funding for the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Also this week, a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., heard arguments in a case challenging work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas and Kentucky. This is the same judge who struck down an earlier version of Kentucky’s proposal.
Meanwhile, Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb is stepping down, but this week he issued more rules intended to prevent minors from purchasing flavored e-cigarette products.
This week’s panelists are Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News, Stephanie Armour of The Wall Street Journal, Alice Ollstein of Politico and Rebecca Adams of CQ Roll Call.
Among the takeaways from this week’s podcast:
Trump’s budget may turn the tables on the Republican Party. It calls for more than $500 billion in reductions to Medicare, much of that in payments to providers. That is similar to what Democrats proposed to help fund the Affordable Care Act — a tactic that Republicans used to whip up widespread opposition to the law and gain control of the House of Representatives. Count on Democrats to return the favor in coming campaigns. Some Republicans, including Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a key Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, signaled concerns about budget cuts recommended by the administration, especially for NIH. On Medicaid, the budget suggests that states be allowed to administer many parts of the program as they see fit. But opponents are likely to ask courts to stop any efforts to weaken federal requirements for coverage. House Democrats have begun an investigation of the marketing and benefits of short-term insurance plans to see if they are denying promised coverage to consumers. The lawmakers are concerned that what they call “junk plans” are confusing consumers who would be better off with policies from the ACA’s marketplace. But any efforts to rein in the plans — which have the blessing of the Trump administration — could run into opposition from Republicans. A federal appeals court this week ruled that Ohio may exclude Planned Parenthood from participating in several small federal health programs that provide money to the state to distribute. The case does not involve either Medicaid or the federal family planning program, but the participation of four judges appointed by Trump could signal a judicial trend.
Plus, for extra credit, the panelists recommend their favorite health policy stories of the week they think you should read too:

Texto completo: [Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Facebook got an early anniversary gift this morning. Unfortunately, it is a date with New York City courts.
The New York Times reported Thursday morning that federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal probe into some of the data-sharing deals Facebook struck with more than 150 companies, including mobile-phone manufacturers. That sent the social network's stock price down Thursday. It also came just a day after a massive service outage that crippled both Facebook and its Instagram service.
Of course, Facebook's security issues are old news by now. Almost exactly one year old, in fact. March 17 of last year is when multiple reports surfaced that the personal data of 87 million Facebook users was obtained by political data firm Cambridge Analytica. The company is now facing multiple legal probes with the Cambridge Analytica investigation still continuing in California court. With billions in potential fines, these dates aren't cheap.

Socialism? Yes, Be Afraid

Texto completo: Something called "socialism" is in the air. Should we worry? The answer is yes, if you can stop laughing.
When the old socialist gent Bernie Sanders appeared in 2016, he was amusing. But intriguingly back then, in most head-to-head polls against the Republican field, Bernie came in first. In May that year he led Donald Trump by a poll average of more than 10 points. Somewhere, he had a following.
Now comes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is Bernie's socialism cubed.
There are moments when the Queens congresswoman calls to mind the "Saturday Night Live" feature "Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey." AOC posted an Instagram video of herself making chili while wondering out loud about the social implications of climate change -- "It does lead, I think, young people to have a legitimate question: Is it OK to still have children?"
This got me to thinking my own deep thought: Is there a point at which self-absorption should be considered a threat to humanity?
At last week's South by Southwest festival, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was the event's biggest draw and received wide coverage for her thoughts on capitalism. She told the Austin, Texas, audience, "We live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die." Finally, the AOC bottom line arrived: "To me, capitalism is irredeemable."
Social-media stardom is a hard habit to kick, so there is going to be more of this, running alongside the presidential campaign. The question for the Democratic Party is whether Rep. Ocasio-Cortez can baptize enough neosocialists into the party to offset the number of traditional Democrats she drives into the arms of Donald Trump. Media stardom aside, eventually it all comes down to who has the most votes.
A recent New York Times article noted that the House Democrats' new Washington act isn't playing well in some districts the party won from Republicans in the midterms, such as in Michigan, Utah and Virginia. A Utah constituent summed up the issue in a question to Rep. Ben McAdams: "How long do you intend to ride that train with those people?"
That's the good news for President Trump. The bad news is there are valid reasons why every Democrat and her mother is lining up to run against him in 2020.
Mr. Trump's approval rating looks as if it will never hit 50%, no matter what. His insistent personal abrasiveness will be a significant X-factor for suburbanites, independents and some traditional Republicans in tossup states, such as Michigan. The strong economy, Mr. Trump's ace, could soften. And again, at the critically important margin for victory, some GOP-leaning voters are simply tired of Mr. Trump being in their face all the time (as inevitably will happen to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).
In short, one of these Democrats could win the presidency. If they win, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wins.
What AOC knows, in part because Donald Trump taught her, is that social media's strength lies in the fact that so many people vastly overstate its powers. Traditional politicians have convinced themselves that massive armies of millennials, on order from people like AOC, are out there waiting to roll over them. Virtually all other reality fades into irrelevance.
How else to explain a nominally intelligent person such as Sen. Kamala Harris instantly signing off on the zillion-dollar costs (and that's barely an exaggeration) of nationalized health care and the Green New Deal and now her own family tax credit of up to $6,000 a year?
In fact, there is an explanation, offered this week by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware: "It's not possible to run for president and be a serious legislator at the same time."
How else to explain the party's leading "moderate" candidate, former businessman and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, answering whether he considers himself a capitalist: "Like, it's maybe not the first label I'd choose." They're all anticapitalist zombies now.
If, as expected, former Vice President Joe Biden announces he's in, nothing -- nothing -- will be more entertaining than listening to Mr. Biden talk his way out of this paper bag.
The reality is that Bernie Sanders of Vermont and now a first-term House Member from New York City have pushed the Democratic Party through an already open door into an infatuation with democratic socialism.
This means the next Democratic administration, and that would include a Biden administration, will sit to the left of the Obama presidency, which itself was a distinct ideological break from all the party's left-of-center presidencies since World War II.
The Obama administration was managed capitalism. Its successor will push past that to administered capitalism, a private-sector co-controlled by the party's representatives.
The blueprint isn't AOC's cooking videos. It's the proposal Sen. Elizabeth Warren
introduced on these pages last August -- the Accountable Capitalism Act, requiring that large firms obtain a federally approved charter and let employees elect 40% of company directors.
Every Trump stump speech now includes this line: "America will never be a socialist country." True. But they, and she, will settle for something just this side of socialism.

Texto completo: Daylight savings time has begun, St. Patrick’s Day is upon us and spring is right around the corner! At the Carroll Arts Center, we have plenty of events to shake off the winter blues. Find out about all of our programs at www.carrollcountyartscouncil.org. If you aren’t a member of the Carroll County Arts Council, please consider joining. Members get a 10 percent discount on most programs.
Now Playing
This weekend, don’t miss a perennial favorite, Barleyjuice! Philadelphia’s Celtic rockers are back, along with their rowdy following of “Juicers,” in a performance that always has the Arts Center rocking! They are playing two shows, March 15 and 16 at 8 p.m. each night. Tickets are $30 for adults and $27 for students and seniors. Thanks to Dr. Patrick Gallagher, O’Lordan’s Irish Pub, and Ting for sponsoring this event!
Saturday, March 16 you’re invited to "Malt Shoppe Murder," a 1950s-themed murder mystery dinner party presented by Whodunnit for Hire and the Best Western Westminster, benefitting the Carroll County Arts Council. As a guest, you will participate with local actors to search for clues, interrogate suspects, and solve the case. Tickets are $75 and include a donation to the Carroll County Arts Council, entertainment, and a deluxe three course dinner.
Join us Wednesday, March 20 as Carroll County Public Library and A Likely Story Bookstore team up to present acclaimed author Harlan Coben. With over 70 million books in print worldwide, Coben is the perennial No. 1 New York Times author of thirty novels. His talk begins at 7 p.m. Tickets are $29 and includes a copy of Coben’s latest novel, “Run Away.”
Come see a showcase of Carroll County’s young talent in the Carroll Arts Center’s production of “A Year with Frog and Toad Kids.” A cast of talented young Carroll County actors, grades 3 through 5, take the stage in this adaptation of the children’s books and Broadway musical. This whimsical show follows two friends, the cheerful Frog and the rather grumpy Toad, through four fun-filled seasons. The show is Friday, March 29 at 7 p.m., Saturday, March 30 at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., and Sunday, March 31 at 1 p.m. Tickets are $8 for adults and $6 for students and seniors.
Friday, April 5, the Film Lovers in Carroll County (FLICC) present “Colette” at 1 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. After moving to Paris, author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette agrees to ghostwrite a semi-autobiographical novel for her husband. Its success inspires her to fight for creative ownership and overcome the societal constraints of the early 20th century. Sponsored by Byrdcall Studio, tickets are $7 for adults and $6 for students and seniors.
A View from the Gallery
March is Youth Art Month here at the Carroll Arts Center! Now through March 26, all three of our galleries will be filled with colorful creativity in this annual showcase featuring the best student art from our county’s elementary and middle schools. It’s also a joyful reflection on the wonderful art teachers in our school system. Don’t miss it!
Easter is right around the corner, and that means PEEPshow! If you want to enter a marshmallow masterpiece, you have until tomorrow to register. The 12th annual PEEPshow takes place April 12-23 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., with extended hours until 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Join us for all the fun you have come to expect, including the PEEP-Mobile, PEEPs mascots, PEEPs candy, and new this year -PEEPs slushies! Come vote for your favorites!
Behind the Scenes
Join Susan Williamson for our Spring Art History series, three Thursdays in March, April, and May. Things kick off on Thursday, March 28 with “Bernini and Borromini, Architects of Baroque Rome” from 1 to 2 p.m. You can get tickets for the whole series for $20.
If you have a budding actor in your family in grades 6 through 8, sign them up to Take the Stage. This class is designed to boost their self-esteem and explore their creativity without the pressure of learning lines. The young actors-to-be will learn basic theatre skills, public speaking skills, short & long term improvisation, and spontaneity through games and exercises in a fun, fast-paced, and supportive environment. The class runs six Saturday mornings, April 27 through June 1 from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. Sign up at www.carrollcountyartscouncil.org.

The blueprint isn't AOC's cooking videos. It's the proposal Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced on these pages last August—the Accountable Capitalism Act, requiring that large firms obtain a federally approved charter and let employees elect 40% of company directors.
Every Trump stump speech now includes this line: "America will never be a socialist country." True. But they, and she, will settle for something just this side of socialism.

Texto completo: With due respect to Santayana, it often seems that those who can remember the past are no less doomed to repeat it, if only as observers. This is the sentiment among many Democratic Party veterans as the presidential nomination contest begins.
In the 10 1/2 months until the Iowa caucuses, Americans will be awash in punditry. Here's a hard-won tip for readers: The more confident the tone, the less you should buy the spiel. The past half-century has yielded an almost nonstop series of surprises.
At this point in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson, elected in a landslide in 1964, seemed to have a lock on his party's 1968 nomination. Less than a year a later, after a narrow victory over a previously obscure Minnesota senator in the New Hampshire primary, he had withdrawn from the race, opening the door to a tumultuous contest.
Four years later, Sen. Edmund Muskie, the party's vice-presidential nominee in 1968 and hailed as Lincolnesque, was anointed the front-runner. He turned out to have a glass jaw and was swept aside by Sen. George McGovern, whose campaign understood that the rules of the game had changed.
Four years after that, a previously unknown one-term Georgia governor captured the mood of the moment with his promise never to lie to the American people. Jimmy Carter won 30 primaries on his way to the nomination and the White House.
Run the reel forward eight years to 1984. On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, former Vice President Walter Mondale was hailed on the front page of the New York Times as the most prohibitive favorite for the presidential nomination in the modern history of the Democratic Party. Twenty-four hours later, he had lost New Hampshire by 10 points to Sen. Gary Hart and was fighting for his political life. The epic contest that ensued, one of the closest in recent times, was not decided until June, after the final primaries in New Jersey and California.
Nineteen eighty-eight? Long before the first votes were cast, a parade of oft-mentioned candidates had declined to enter the race, and a scandal had forced Mr. Hart to withdraw. Those who remained were lampooned as the Seven Dwarfs (with Rep. Patricia Schroeder briefly playing Snow White). The eventual winner, Michael Dukakis, survived an unimpressive third-place finish in Iowa and emerged from the hardest-to-handicap field in modern times.
The result closest to the widely predicted outcome came in 2000, when Bill Bradley's attempt to overtake Vice President Al Gore fell short in New Hampshire. Yet this expected outcome was a mere exception. Two thousand eight continued the parade of pundit-defying surprises. So did Bernie Sanders's charge in 2016, which resembled Mr. Hart's challenge in 1984.
And so, with a bow to history, here is a partial list of "known unknowns" that will figure in the 2020 Democratic race:
We do not know for sure that Joe Biden, who entered the Senate when Richard Nixon was president, will join the race. If he doesn't, others who are hanging back probably will get in. If he does, he will bring with him enough baggage to fill the Amtrak to Wilmington, Del. How much time will he be forced to spend playing defense, and to what effect? Will Democrats care that he would be the oldest man -- by far -- ever to receive a major party's nomination?
Now that Mr. Sanders has entered the race and re-emerged as a leading contender, he will face the age issue (he's a year older than Mr. Biden) as well as the serious scrutiny of his record that he avoided in 2016.
As for the rest:
Will Elizabeth Warren's earnest, idea-laden geek-chic campaign catch fire in Iowa's frozen tundra?
Can Kamala Harris match her large campaign personality with sure-footedness on the issues central to the nominating contest?
Can Amy Klobuchar put the staff-abuse controversy behind her and jump-start her campaign in the state just south of her own?
Will angry Democrats give Cory Booker's happy-warrior campaign a hearing? What about John Hickenlooper's "I can get it done" message? Or Pete Buttigieg's fresh-faced self-presentation?
If the Hamlet on the Rio Grande enters the race, will he show enough substance to persuade voters he can be president?
And looming over the fray, four defining questions:
In the time of #MeToo, will Democrats unite around any man with blemishes on his record?
In the age of Black Lives Matter, will Democrats accept candidates whose past positions contradict today's orthodoxies?
Will revolution-minded but victory-hungry Democrats nominate an avowed socialist, or will they settle for a center-left incrementalist who endorses their goals but not their policies?
And finally: In the era of Donald Trump, do traditional qualifications such as foreign-policy experience even matter anymore?
We'll find out.

Texto completo: One was a lecturer interested in the effective use of computers in the classroom.The other had published papers on the challenges of teaching English as a second language in Kenya. Both excelled at teaching others to teach.
The two professors at Kenyatta University in Kenya shared something else in common: They were passengers on Ethiopian Airways Flight 302, heading home after a work trip in Italy. The plane crashed Sunday shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard.
Kenyatta University officials confirmed the deaths of the professors, Isaac Mwangi, a lecturer in the department of education, communication and technology, and Agnes Gathumbi, a director of teacher professional development.
Aid workers were also killed in the crash. Four were employees of Catholic Relief Services, all of them Ethiopian citizens who were traveling to Nairobi for training.
Sintayehu Aymeku was a procurement manager who left behind a wife and three daughters. Sara Chalachew was a senior project officer for grants. Mulusew Alemu was a senior officer in the finance department. Getnet Alemayehu was a senior project officer for procurement and compliance. He had a wife and one daughter.
"Although we are in mourning, we celebrate the lives of these colleagues and the selfless contributions they made to our mission, despite the risks and sacrifices that humanitarian work can often entail," the organization said in a statement.
In Nigeria, the government confirmed the death of Abiodun Bashuaa, a former ambassador who had been working with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.
He joined the Nigerian foreign service in 1976 and worked in several countries, including Austria, Ivory Coast, and Iran, according to a statement from the Nigerian Foreign Ministry. He also worked with the United Nations on peacekeeping operations and climate change issues.
A day after the crash, a somber mood engulfed the U.N. headquarters in Nairobi, as politicians, environmentalists and government officials gathered for a major U.N. meeting on the environment -- a destination for many people aboard the flight.
At least 22 people who worked for U.N.-affiliated agencies were aboard the flight.
One was Joanna Toole, a U.N. fisheries consultant from southwest England, who two days before she boarded the flight tweeted that she was happy to be among an increasing number of women working for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
"Great to be part of the growing number of women" working on fisheries issues, she wrote, adding a hashtag referring to International Women's Day.
The crash -- of a flight that had been nicknamed the "U.N. shuttle" because of how often U.N. staff members take it -- has also highlighted the organization's work in some of the world's most troubled regions, from South Sudan to North Korea.
The United Nations said its staff members on the flight had worked with several agency programs and affiliated organizations, as well as U.N. offices in Kenya and Somalia.
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres offered "heartfelt condolences" to the families and loved ones of the U.N. staff members who died in the crash. He also said in an email to staff that flags at U.N. offices would fly at half-mast Monday to honor the victims.
The World Food Program said seven of its staff members had died in the crash, the most of any U.N. organization. The program's work focuses on widespread hunger caused by war or instability in Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen, among other countries.

Immaculate Odero
Current and former staffers of Atlanta-based CARE were among the 157 people killed in the Ethiopian Airways Flight 302 crash Sunday.
Immaculate Odero was a regional security officer for the Horn of Africa.She never worked in Atlanta.
A CARE spokesman said Odero lived in Nairobi and was traveling back home after a field deployment with CARE.
In her job, she provided various forms of support to countries in the Horn of Africa, including Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Sudan.She started working for the global nonprofit in 2018.
CARE issued a statement calling Odero "a cherished member of the CARE family" and said she is survived by her husband and a daughter.
CARE Canada is also mourning the loss of a former staffer, Jessica Hyba. --SHELIA POOLE
MORE DETAILS " "
The 157 victims represented 35 nationalities. Kenya suffered the biggest loss among the countries represented on the flight, losing 32 of its citizens.
The United Nations, which has major operations in both Kenya and Ethiopia, was the hardest-hit organization. Many of the 22 people who worked for U.N.-affiliated agencies on board Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were traveling to Nairobi for a U.N. environmental conference, which opened Monday with flags at half staff and a minute of silence for the victims.

AJC WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH HOLLY HUNTER: Oscar-winning actress got her start on local stages

Texto completo: Oscar-winning actress Holly Hunter grew up on a farm in Conyers in the 1960s and 1970s but wasn't allowed to partake in any of the heavy lifting.
"Boys had chores and girls did not," she said to Jane Pauley of "CBS Sunday Morning" in 2016, "i.e., drive tractors, bale hay, take care of cattle."
Hunter, the youngest of seven children, told the U.K. Metro last year that "I was very jealous of my brothers. I wanted to drive a tractor. I wanted responsibility. I wanted to be able to do a good job. I wished for that."
Instead, "I was mainly left unattended to play and pretend. Probably that's where I started thinking about acting."
That career choice has suited her well.
At age 60,Hunter has a résumé that covers verdant territory.TV movies.TV series. Broadway. Prestige films. Quirky indie films. Action films. Animation. She's worked with A-list actors such as Al Pacino, Tom Cruise, Robin Williams and Sigourney Weaver and legendary producers such as Steven Spielberg, Jonathan Demme and Sydney Pollack. She has garnered four Oscar nominations ( "Broadcast News," "The Firm," "The Piano" and "Thirteen"), winning for "The Piano."
Hunter was willing to jump between film and TV long before that became fashionable. She had an Emmy-winning turn in "Roe vs. Wade" for TV after "Broadcast News." Following her challenging role as a mute in "The Piano," she went full-on felonious in HBO's descriptive "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom." She won an Emmy for that, too.
Given her relatively diminutive size (5 feet, 2 inches tall) and her distinctive Southern drawl, she doesn't fit the traditional Hollywood starlet mold along the lines of Smyrna-born Julia Roberts.
"I've always kind of drifted between being a character actress and being a leading lady,"Hunter told NPR last year. "It hasn't been a mainstream kind of thing that I've offered. And at the same time, I've been able to carve my own niche out of the culture."
And unlike many of her peers such as Sharon Stone and Michelle Pfeiffer, Hunter over the years assiduously stayed out of the tabloids. In interviews, she rarely talks about her kids or her personal life. "I shall neither confirm nor deny the existence of my children," Hunter joked to The New York Times last year.
Hunter began acting at Rockdale High School in the early 1970s, performing in "Oklahoma," "Man of La Mancha" and "Fiddler on the Roof."
"There were three or four of us who kinda dominated the productions," she told AJC's Eleanor Ringel in 1987. "I was certainly one of the regulars, but it was more than just me."
At a State Play Contest in Athens, Fred Chappell, artistic director of the Alliance Theater at the time, spotted her. She spent two summers with his stock company in Cortland, New York.
"Even at that age, she was so impressive," said Chappell, who now teaches at Florida State University, in an interview last week. "Very focused. Had a strong work ethic. She was very serious about her career even then."
After acting at Carnegie Mellon University, Hunter broke into Hollywood with a tiny part in a horror film, "The Burning." Then came the Coen brothers, who saw her on Broadway in "Crimes of the Heart" and asked her to read for their film "Blood Simple." The part went instead to future fellow Oscar winner Frances McDormand, but since the two actresses were best friends and roommates, there were no hard feelings The Coen brothers eventually wrote breakthrough film "Raising Arizona" specifically with Hunter in mind.
"So that film came about in a real family kind of way," Hunter said to the AJC in 1987. "The Coens had been friends for years, and as far as directing me, they'd mostly just say, 'Hey, Holly, go!' "
Early in her career, she worried her size might hold her back, but James L.Brooks -- seeking someone to play the hard-nosed yet vulnerable news producer Jane Craig on "Broadcast News" -- proved her wrong.
"With 'Broadcast News,' it became a non-issue, and with 'The Piano,' it became a non-issue," Hunter recalled in 2016 at the Hamptons International Film Festival. "Both parts were written for more statuesque women.It was nice to change people's minds about that because that's neither here nor there."
After her Emmy-nominated turn as the complex, morally blurry Grace in TNT's "Saving Grace" from 2007 to 2010,Hunter sought film roles as she entered her 50s and was sorely disappointed.
"I just thought that (Grace) was an incredible boundaryless character that I got to stretch out in over the course of 'Saving Grace,' " she said to NPR in 2018. "And when I got back to the feature film world, there was so little opportunity that I was really kind of stunned. I was looking to take a slight break but not exactly a hiatus."
Fortunately, she received accolades as a protective mom in 2017's "The Big Sick" and brought fire to Elastigirl in "Incredibles 2" last year.
"Now I'm 60, and I'm still acting," she said to the U.K. Daily Observer last year. "That's pretty good. So in a lot of ways, I defied my own expectations. I think acting has provided me with all these adventures that I never could have really anticipated. It's a great career and it continues to be a great career."

Cover-Up Is Alleged In Google Executive Packages

Texto completo: Google agreed to pay $135 million in exit packages to two top executives who left the company after being accused of sexual harassment and covered up the reasons for their departures, according to a complaint filed in a lawsuit unsealed Monday.
The former executives, Andy Rubin and Amit Singhal, oversaw some of the company's most important and profitable arms.
Mr. Rubin, who left in 2014, created the company's crucial Android software, while Mr. Singhal, who departed in 2016, headed search.
Mr. Rubin was accused by a subordinate of pressuring her into oral sex, among other claims, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Singhal was accused by a female employee of groping her at a "boozy off-site event," according to the suit. The board of Google's parent, now called Alphabet Inc., approved the payments with little dissent, according to the lawsuit.
The complaint, which cites information from Google, says the company agreed to pay Mr. Singhal about $45 million, the first time that number has been made public. It only ended up paying $15 million because Mr. Singhal later joined a competitor.
Ellen Stross, attorney for Mr. Rubin, said, "Andy strongly denies any misconduct." Mr. Singhal didn't respond to a request for comment. The New York Times last year reported the amount of some payouts, including $90 million to Mr. Rubin.
A Google spokeswoman said in a statement: "There are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately at Google. In recent years, we've made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority."
The public disclosure of the payments came in a civil shareholder lawsuit filed in California Superior Court that alleges Google schemed to cover up persistent sexual harassment and discrimination. Google provided the information about executive payments and board deliberations in response to the suit.
Those documents cite evidence suggesting that Google's board and top executives, including co-founder Larry Page, played down in internal discussions the role of the allegations in the two executives' departures.
Meeting minutes from the board's compensation committee after Mr. Rubin's departure, for instance, read simply: "Andy Rubin resigned to start a hardware startup incubator."
In fact, Google had conducted an extensive internal investigation of Mr. Rubin, and found that his alleged victim was credible, according to the lawsuit.
Google later invested millions of dollars in Mr. Rubin's next company.
Separately, in February 2016 the compensation committee recorded that Mr. Singhal "left Google to focus on philanthropic activities." Google had earlier investigated the groping allegation against Mr. Singhal and decided to accept his resignation, according to the lawsuit.
The payouts put a fresh exclamation point on the simmering issue of gender equality and sexual harassment in Silicon Valley. The technology world employs a relative paucity of female executives, and a tiny fraction of venture-capital money goes to woman-led companies, research indicates.
Google employees in November staged a high-profile global walkout to protest a workplace culture that they said was unsafe for women. The company subsequently made changes, including committing to end a requirement for employee sexual-harassment claims to be handled in private arbitration.
The board materials provided for the lawsuit hint at potential further payments to other executives. Former human-resources head Laszlo Bock is quoted referring to "select past cases," in determining Mr. Singhal's exit package.
Mr. Bock didn't respond to a request for comment. The Google spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether the company paid severance to or settlements for additional executives besides Messrs. Rubin and Singhal.

Texto completo: The New York attorney general's office late on Monday issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump Organization projects and a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in 2014, according to a person briefed on the subpoenas.
The inquiry opens a new front in the scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, one of the few lenders willing to do business with Donald J. Trump in recent years. The bank is already the subject of two congressional investigations and was examined last year by New York banking regulators, who took no action.
The new inquiry, by the office of the attorney general, Letitia James, was prompted by the congressional testimony last month of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer and fixer, the person briefed on the subpoenas said. Mr. Cohen testified under oath that Mr. Trump had inflated his assets in financial statements, and Mr. Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank.
The inquiry by Ms. James's office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear. The attorney general has broad authority under state law to investigate fraud and can fine -- or in extreme cases, go to court to try to dissolve -- a business that is found to have engaged in repeated illegality.
The request to Deutsche Bank sought loan applications, mortgages, lines of credit and other financing transactions in connection with the Trump International Hotel in Washington; the Trump National Doral outside Miami; and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, the person said.
Investigators also requested records connected to an unsuccessful effort to buy the Bills, the person said. Mr. Trump gave Deutsche Bank bare-bones personal financial statements in 2014 when he planned to make a bid for the team, The New York Times has reported. The deal fell through when the team was sold to a rival bidder for $1.4 billion.
Mr. Trump worked with a small United States-based unit of Deutsche Bank that serves ultra-wealthy people. The unit lent Mr. Trump more than $100 million in 2012 to pay for the Doral golf resort and $170 million in 2015 to transform the Old Post Office Building in Washington into a luxury hotel.
New Jersey-based Investors Bank was subpoenaed for records relating to Trump Park Avenue, a project it had backed.
Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The subpoenas are a culmination of months of threats from Ms. James that she would aggressively investigate Mr. Trump. In August, referring to the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election, she said "the president of the United States has to worry about three things: Mueller, Cohen, and Tish James."
In her victory speech on the night she was elected in November, she said, "I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn." The next month, before taking office, she told NBC that "we will use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family."
Mr. Trump has a rich recent history of grievances against the New York attorney general's office. Before former Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman resigned amid allegations of assault and abuse against women, he pursued cases against the Trump Foundation and Trump University. Mr. Trump has referred to him as "sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman" and "Shady Eric." He also assailed Mr. Schneiderman's temporary successor, Barbara D. Underwood, and has referred to Ms. James as "yet another AG" who "openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda."
"Will never be treated fairly by these people -- a total double standard of 'justice,"' he added on Twitter.
In Congress, the House Intelligence Committee has been exploring real estate transactions related to Russia and other foreign interests, including Deutsche Bank loans to the Trump Organization.

Texto completo: Google agreed to pay $135 million in exit packages to two top executives who left the company after being accused of sexual harassment and covered up the reasons for their departures, according to a complaint filed in a lawsuit unsealed Monday.
The former executives, Andy Rubin and Amit Singhal, oversaw some of the company's most important and profitable arms.
Mr. Rubin, who left in 2014 , created the company's crucial Android software, while Mr. Singhal, who departed in 2016, headed search.
Mr. Rubin was accused by a subordinate of pressuring her into oral sex, among other claims, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Singhal was accused by a female employee of groping her at a "boozy off-site event," according to the suit. The board of Google's parent, now called Alphabet Inc., approved the payments with little dissent, according to the lawsuit.
The complaint, which cites information from Google, says the company agreed to pay Mr. Singhal about $45 million, the first time that number has been made public. It only ended up paying $15 million because Mr. Singhal later joined a competitor.
Ellen Stross, attorney for Mr. Rubin, said, "Andy strongly denies any misconduct." Mr. Singhal didn't respond to a request for comment. The New York Times last year reported the amount of some payouts, including $90 million to Mr. Rubin.
A Google spokeswoman said in a statement: "There are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately at Google. In recent years, we've made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority."
The public disclosure of the payments came in a civil shareholder lawsuit filed in California Superior Court that alleges Google schemed to cover up persistent sexual harassment and discrimination. Google provided the information about executive payments and board deliberations in response to the suit.
Those documents cite evidence suggesting that Google's board and top executives, including co-founder Larry Page, played down in internal discussions the role of the allegations in the two executives' departures.
Meeting minutes from the board's compensation committee after Mr. Rubin's departure, for instance, read simply: "Andy Rubin resigned to start a hardware startup incubator."
In fact, Google had conducted an extensive internal investigation of Mr. Rubin, and found that his alleged victim was credible, according to the lawsuit.
Google later invested millions of dollars in Mr. Rubin's next company.
Separately, in February 2016 the compensation committee recorded that Mr. Singhal "left Google to focus on philanthropic activities." Google had earlier investigated the groping allegation against Mr. Singhal and decided to accept his resignation, according to the lawsuit.
The payouts put a fresh exclamation point on the simmering issue of gender equality and sexual harassment in Silicon Valley. The technology world employs a relative paucity of female executives, and a tiny fraction of venture-capital money goes to woman-led companies, research indicates.

For a growing number of Americans, socialism is OK

Texto completo: You wouldn’t expect democratic socialists to hit the brakes when it comes to social justice.
But in late February members of Inland Empire Democratic Socialists of America learned how to fix brake lights so they could offer that bit of auto repair service, for free, at an upcoming community event. Working tail lights, they reasoned, would mean fewer police traffic stops and, possibly, fewer fatal outcomes for people of color.
Auto repair is just one part of the chapter’s public outreach about an ideology that, increasingly, is finding a more receptive public audience. Polling shows more Americans, especially Democrats, view socialism more favorably than capitalism, even if they have sometimes wildly different ideas of what socialism is.
“It just doesn’t have the same stigma,” Kimberley Coles, a political anthropologist at the University of Redlands, said of the word “socialism.”
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be … rhetoric and seeing what sticks in terms of the insults.”
A Gallup poll from last summer found that for the first time in 10 years, Democrats had a more positive view of socialism (57 percent) than they did of capitalism (45 percent). That shift among Democrats drove down the overall view of capitalism.
“A majority of Americans have retained a positive view of capitalism over the past eight years, but this year’s 56% positive rating is by four points the lowest recorded since 2010,” Gallup reported. “Americans’ positive views of socialism have varied only between 35% and 39%, with (2018’s) reading of 37% right at the trend average.”
Gallup also found that among young people (ages 18 to 29) capitalism had slipped from 68 percent approval in 2010 to 45 percent approval last year.
Gallup isn’t the only pollster seeing that trend.
Thirty-one percent of Democrats in a YouGov poll from last August said they would be “comfortable” with a socialist presidential candidate, compared to just 8 percent for Republicans.
The same YouGov poll found 44 percent of Americans had a favorable view of capitalism, down from 52 percent in 2015. Americans age 18 through 29 are likelier to see the word “socialist” as a compliment while Americans age 65 and older are more likely to consider it an insult, although the 65-and-up group views socialism more favorably now (25 percent) than in 2015 (15 percent), according to YouGov.
Capitalism’s polling dip — and the corresponding rise in approval for the label “socialism” — coincides with ballot box gains by politicians who are connected with the political organization Democratic Socialists of America.
Running as Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2018 became the first Democratic Socialists of America members to win congressional seats. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected 2016 presidential campaign fueled an effort to turn the Democratic Party leftward, a trend that’s continued with Ocasio-Cortez’s celebrity status.
Nationally, Democratic Socialists of America had just 5,000 members prior to November 2016, but passed the 40,000-member mark following Ocasio-Cortez’s upset in New York’s June 2018 primary, according to published reports.
The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

Texto completo: Google agreed to pay $135 million in exit packages to two top executives who left the company after being accused of sexual harassment and covered up the reasons for their departures, according to a complaint filed in a lawsuit unsealed Monday.

Google provided the information about executive payments and board deliberations in response to the suit.
The payouts put a fresh exclamation point on the simmering issue of gender equality and sexual harassment in Silicon Valley. The technology world employs a relative paucity of female executives, and a tiny fraction of venture-capital money goes to woman-led companies, research indicates.
Google employees in November staged a high-profile global walkout to protest a workplace culture that they said was unsafe for women. The company subsequently made changes, including committing to end a requirement for employee sexual-harassment claims to be handled in private arbitration.
The spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether Google paid severance to or settlements for additional executives besides Messrs. Rubin and Singhal.

Texto completo: It's the worst feeling. You're opening your mail (or email) and get a note that your bank account has been hacked.
Mine came in the form of a bank employee clicking on a phishing email. That mistake compromised my son's bank account and my email address. Like so many people, I used that email for almost everything.
Instead of running around in panic, here's a little trick to help with the frustrating situation: consciously uncouple your email accounts.
THINK ABOUT WHO RECEIVES YOUR EMAILS Whether you like it or not your email is a public calling card. Set up different accounts for different purposes. Think of them as content buckets. Decide who receives what.
Create an email only used for shopping, another for your bank -- I separated it from my credit cards -- social media, your children and so forth.
The best way to do this is to have the one account and use plus aliasing, says Troy Hunt, a Microsoft regional director based in Australia. That means that if you have an address like fakeemailaddress@gmail.com you can use fakeemailaddress+1@gmail.com and fakeemailaddress+2@gmail.com and still get the emails to the same inbox.
I use gmail and outlook to parse things out but funnel all accounts into two separate inboxes to quickly track.
TRACK AND VERIFY The basics are still important. Use strong unique passwords via a password manager and enable two-factor authentication. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, suggests LastPass for most people. If you suspect your email has been compromised, a good place to start is going to Have I Been Pwned and Pwned Passwords.

Texto completo: The maker of kitchen classics like Pyrex and Coming-Ware is adding a new culinary darling, the Instant Pot, to its cupboard.
Corelle Brands, which owns Pyrex and other brands, said last week it planned to merge with Instant Brands, the Canadian producer of electric multicookers that have taken the public by storm.
Such is the popularity of the Instant Pot - a sort of hybrid of gadgets like a pressure cooker and a slow cooker - that it has legions of self-described "Pothead" fans online. An Instant Pot group on Facebook has 1.8 million members.
It was created by Robert Wang, a computer scientist who spent $350,000 of his own money trying to create a cooker that could handle several different tasks.
The Instant Pot went on sale in 2010. A confluence of factors - its availability on Amazon, touting of technological advancements like sensors to help optimize cooking, relatively low price and popularity among bloggers - helped make it a phenomenon.
The success of Wang's invention has inspired scores of cooking websites now to promote recipes for items like Instant Pot spaghetti, butter chicken and cheesecake, while also prompting bigger rivals like Breville and Cuisinart to come up with competing products.
Now Instant Pot's parent, which is based in Ottawa, Ontario, is itself set to become part of a much bigger company. Corelle, previously known as World Kitchen, was acquired by private equity firm Cornell Capital in 2017. It has 21 offices on three continents.
Corelle's chief executive, Ken Wilkes, said in a statement that Instant Brands and its products "have become a staple in kitchens in North America, fundamentally changing how consumers think about cooking."
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Wilkes will be the chief executive of the combined business. Wang's title will be chief innovation officer. Instant Brands will keep its headquarters in Ottawa.
Although Instant Brands has already expanded its product lineup, combining with Corelle will give it the ability to expand internationally, Wang said in a statement.
"We are thrilled to partner with a global market leader in Corelle Brands as we look to embark on our next chapter of strategic growth and expansion," he said.

Texto completo: The notion that health care outside the United States could be good as well as cheap is a foreign concept to many Americans.
Kathleen Peddicord frequently hears from such skeptics as founder of Live and Invest Overseas, a site for people curious about living abroad. Actual expats, however, tell of quality care at a fraction of U.S. prices. For instance, treatment for a motorbike accident in Panama cost her $20. Emergency dental surgery that might cost $10,000 or more in the United States was $4,500 in Paris.
"The health care in a lot of places around the world is very good, as good as in the United States," said Peddicord, who currently divides her time between Paris and Panama. "Some places, it is better."
RETIREE CONCERNS
Health care is a particular concern for Americans who want to retire before age 65, when Medicare kicks in. Currently, early retirees can buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but it's not always truly affordable and its future is uncertain.
Some who would otherwise retire keep working rather than risk being uninsured. But a move abroad could be an option.
Cheaper health care also may appeal to gig-economy workers who aren't tied to stateside jobs. Freelance science writer Erica Rex, for example, recently wrote an opinion column for The New York Times about moving to the United Kingdom and then France after her 2009 cancer diagnosis. "Moving to Europe was a choice weighed against other, grimmer options for health care, which included the strong possibility of being bankrupted by cancer treatment and winding up at the mercy of New York State's welfare system," she wrote.
HEALTH CARE QUALITY VARIES BY DESTINATION
Not all expat havens have great health care systems. Belize, for example, encourages immigration by exempting retirees from most income taxes - but many expats there cross the border to Mexico for health care, Peddicord says.
France, on the other hand, is known for its excellent health care system. International Living and Live and Invest Overseas give the country top marks, along with Mexico, Ecuador and Malaysia. International Living praises Thailand and Costa Rica as well, while Live and Invest Overseas says Portugal, Italy and Malta have admirable health care.
With any country, quality can vary - especially in sparsely populated areas. Murray and his wife, Diane, left their first retirement destination, a small town in Ecuador, after encountering broken equipment and few doctors. They're much happier with the care near their Yucatán Peninsula home, where next-day appointments are the norm and doctors typically trained in the United States or Europe, he says.
"It's like in the U.S. - if you live in Possum Belly, Alabama, and they don't have a hospital and the nearest one is an hour and a half away, the health care isn't going to be the same" as in a major city, Murray says.
OPTIONS FOR HEALTH CARE ACCESS Expats may  qualify for a country's public health care system if they become residents. Otherwise, there's typically a private system in which people can pay out of pocket and get reimbursed if they have private health insurance. Kathleen Peddicord and her husband, who are in their 50s, have an international health insurance policy that covers them whether they're traveling or at home in France or Panama. The annual cost is about $3,000 for both . Don Murray, 69, and his wife pay about $80 a month for Mexico's public health system, but use private doctors and pay out of pocket for most care . "My personal budget no longer contains a line for health care expenses," Murray says. "They are so inconsequential there is no ne

THE VALUE OF REAL JOURNALISM: 'Polititainment' has no substance

Texto completo: ST. SIMONS ISLAND, GA.-- You really shouldn't read this column.
I probably shouldn't be writing it.
It's about nothing; and everything.
America is now shaped by meaningless words and images that burn brightly before becoming vapor. We mistake the bright light for importance.
It is sound and fury signifying nothing.
It deepens our divisions. What's worse, the bright light diverts us from what really matters. We solve nothing as we waste precious time, energy and good will.
What am I talking about?
A few weeks ago a group of teenage boys wearing red MAGA hats appeared to menace an elderly Native American man outside the Lincoln Memorial.
Instantly, the Twittersphere declared these young men racist thugs.
These images seemed to confirm the worst fears of folks who hate President Trump and the world they believe he has wrought.
Hateful words filled our feeds. Outrage fueled outrage.
In a saner world, this moment of staring and chanting would have gone unnoticed. But in our world, it isn't the news that's newsworthy, it's the digital noise.
And there was video -- which can't lie, right?
Seeing an audience swelling on social media, the Cable News Industrial Complex ramped up to gather clicks and eyeballs, pouring on more outrage.
The Fox News tribe circled the wagons as the MSNBC crowd stepped up its attack.
Eventually, even actual journalists could no longer look away.
The New York Times, our "gray lady" of rectitude, quickly produced the headline: "Boys in 'Make America Great Again' Hats Mob Native Elder at Indigenous Peoples March."
"Mob?"
As usual, the noise belatedly surrendered to reporting. The story "evolved." The Times produced a second story: "Fuller Picture Emerges of Viral Video of Native American Man and Catholic Students."
The "mob" evolved into "Catholic students."
Other videos and interviews produced a more complex and nuanced account. The original video did kinda lie.
Soon, the indignant tweets from the left were replaced by indignant tweets from the right. The Cable News Industrial Complex continued cranking until its tribes moved on to the next shiny object.
In the end, nothing had happened. Nothing was learned. Nothing was solved. And we all hated each other just a little more.
"Hate" is a strong word, and I don't use it lightly. I just read an interesting book by Sen. Ben Sasse, the very conservative senator from Nebraska. The title: "Them: Why We Hate Each Other -- and How to Heal."
He writes much about the toxic and symbiotic relationship between social media and mass media -- particularly cable news with its 24-7 hunger for anything to hold eyeballs until the next commercial.
He argues that "polititainment" -- the unholy love child of politics and entertainment posing as news -- is deeply harmful.
"Polititainment inevitably distorts our political foes like a gigantic funhouse mirror," he writes. "Many of our television hosts are modern-day carnival barkers. We can get dopamine, adrenaline, and oxytocin all at once. It's an adult video game. But instead of expertly separating us from our wallets, they're separating us from things much more valuable: our time, our sense of perspective, and our judgment. And they're separating us from each other."
Just look at the more recent and noisier fury around Jussie Smollett's claim that he was violently attacked by racists in Chicago. This media spasm was fueled by race and a dose of celebrity steroids.
One day in late January, social media exploded with reports that two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs had attacked Smollett, a lesser-known actor (at least to me) on the TV show "Empire."
Smollett said the two men put a rope around his neck.
Predictably the Cable News Industrial Complex churned into breaking news overdrive, stoking fresh outrage. Politicians seized the moment -a "modern day lynching."
Except it wasn't.
Police soon charged Smollett with making the whole thing up. Nevertheless, he entered the lofty realm of Saturday Night Live parody and now clocks way better name recognition numbers than your local member of Congress.
Real racial violence is a core American issue; too important and incendiary to ever be squandered thusly.
Was this hoax worthy of our front pages, time and attention? Was it worth the net rise in hatred?
In a better world, journalism would separate meaningless junk from real news.
Over my years at the AJC, we used journalism daily to figure out whether an allegation was worthy of our ink and website. In that world, we would have gone slowly with the Catholic boys and Smollett stories. We would have probed for potential harm. We are skeptics and would have asked questions and checked facts. Only then would we arrive at the decision about whether to publish.
Of course we make mistakes, but if one of our reporters writes it, you can accept it as a reliable account of the truth. You can also rely on our editors to use their judgment to separate meaning from meaningless.
This is what you pay us to do. When we get it wrong, we say so. Ever see a correction on cable news?
In these days of "polititainment," journalism can seem a quaint luxury.
Nevertheless, real journalism is the only real antidote to the poison dividing our country.
I like the way Sasse describes the value of what we do, even if it also seems quaint: "News was what people needed to know to go about their day or to begin thinking about their upcoming voting," he writes. "It was information that was supposed to help us make responsible decisions about future civic duties."
I'm not a Pollyanna -- well, maybe I am -- but I believe in this vision of news.
And I also believe this is a two-way street. You have a duty to help fix this mess. Nothing will improve until American adults begin to demand and partake in real journalism.
This takes work, and it isn't easy to read stories that may challenge your beliefs.
For starters, we should all pledge to look past these trivial moments disguised as news. We should all read more from newsrooms that practice traditional journalism, such as the AJC.
We journalists must also stop giving power to these flashes of sound and fury by not writing about them at all.
As I said, I shouldn't have written this column.
And you shouldn't have read it.

Klobuchar Talks Health Care, Impeachment and, Yes, the Infamous Comb

Texto completo: There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be.
Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: "Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?"
"We're going to start with the comb," Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded.
"The comb" was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. In 2008, The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it.
"It was me sort of doing a mom thing," Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday's event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. "I didn't have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move."
The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it.
The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off -- and that if they didn't, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave.
In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar's office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask.
Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she "can be tough on people," acknowledged -- as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff -- that she was "sometimes too tough." "I can push them too hard," she said. "I can always do better."
Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly.
"I'm not going to go there," she said, adding, "Whatever it is, I just can't waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That's why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River."
In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada ("In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch," she joked); ending the "pay for delay" practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats.
She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, "You can't have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else." She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he "tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn't respect the amendment that allows him to do it."
She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar's recent comments about American politicians' support for Israel, "because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia" -- but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar's own background as a refugee.
Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as "one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system."
Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies.
Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers' behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products.
"You can be an umpire -- a platform -- or you can own teams. That's fine. But you can't be an umpire and own one of the teams that's in the game," she said. "Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America. That's how capitalism should work."
"The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits," she added. "Boo-hoo."
Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better.
"There's an enormous amount to be gained from markets," she said. "But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft."
As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality. In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans was 27 percentage points. Today, it is 30 percentage points.
"Race matters," she said. "And until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it."

Texto completo: Twenty-eight members of the U. S. national women's soccer team filed a federal gender discrimination lawsuit against the U. S. Soccer Federation on Friday morning.
In the complaint, which was filed in U. S. District Court in California, the players allege gender discrimination on a number of levels, from their salaries to the types of fields on which they play and their travel accommodations on the road.
"Despite the fact that these female and male players are called upon to perform the same job responsibilities on their teams and participate in international competitions for their single common employer, the USSF, the female players have been consistently paid less money than their male counterparts," the players write in the lawsuit, which was obtained by USA TODAY Sports.
"This is true even though their performance has been superior to that of the male players — with the female players, in contrast to male players, becoming world champions. "
The players — including stars such as Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, among others — are also seeking class-action status, which means the lawsuit would represent all current and former members of the women's national team since Feb. 4, 2015.
The New York Times first reported the existence of the lawsuit Friday — which is also International Women's Day.
The lawsuit represents the continuation of a years-long fight for equal pay from women's soccer players. Four players filed a discrimination complaint with the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016 and were issued rights to sue early last month, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit also comes roughly three months before the team will set out to defend its World Cup crown, with its first match in France scheduled for June 11.
A spokesperson for U. S. Soccer did not immediately reply to an email from USA TODAY Sports seeking comment on the lawsuit.
In their complaint, the players claim that U. S. Soccer has "continually rejected WNT players’ requests for pay equal to the pay afforded to MNT players" and continued to employ a pay scale that is skewed in favor of men.
Among a number of specific examples listed in the lawsuit, the female players claim that women's national team players were given $15,000 apiece for making the 2015 World Cup roster, while men were given $55,000 apiece the previous year. The female players also claim that the men's national team earned $5. 375 million in bonuses for its performance in the 2014 World Cup — a loss in the Round of 16 — while the women earned $1. 725 million for winning the 2015 tournament.
The lawsuit also claims that "during the period relevant to this case, the WNT earned more in profit and/or revenue than the MNT. "
Finances aside, the women's national team members argue that they receive unequal treatment in terms of travel accommodations and playing conditions. They claim they are required to play on artificial surfaces more frequently than the men's team, and receive charter flights to away games less frequently.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Tiptoeing along the edge of caricature, Sen. Elizabeth Warren says: Native Americans should be "at the table" with African-Americans for a "robust discussion" about making some Americans pay reparations to other Americans to atone for misdeeds by still other Americans. The enumeration of the misdeeds, and the assignment of guilt for them, will presumably come later. What is, however, already clear is that the Massachusetts Democrat is going to need a large table.
If reparations are owed to the descendants of all members of minority groups that experienced protracted discrimination, the Irish can apply, citing the widespread practice of employers posting admonitions that "Irish need not apply." Italians, too: An 1895 advertisement seeking labor to build a New York reservoir said whites would be paid $1.30 to $1.50 per day, "colored" workers $1.25 to $1.40 and Italians $1.15 to $1.25. Asians on the West Coast were subject to severe discrimination and violence. And Jews were restricted from acquiring the momentum that elite universities impart on the path to wealth.
Native Americans and African-Americans experienced uniquely severe injustices. However, there must be some statute of limitations to close the books on attempts to assign guilt across many generations to many categories of offenders (racial, ethnic, class). How does one compute the compensation that can justly be extracted from persons who, although they participate today in the national prosperity to which slaves involuntarily made substantial contributions, had no participation in the injustices inflicted?
It is also true that the nation as a whole was injured by the exclusion of African-Americans' talents from American dynamism, both before and after hundreds of thousands of white Union soldiers were killed or maimed -- should their descendants be exempted from paying reparations? -- in the Civil War that ended slavery. But, then, semi-slavery survived for almost a century in Jim Crow laws after the end of Reconstruction.
If, however, you doubt that American discord can become much worse, try launching a scramble among racial and ethnic constituencies to assign varying degrees of guilt to others for varying degrees of injuries. Should reparations be means-tested, making affluent African-Americans ineligible? To avoid using moral micrometers to measure guilt and injuries, should lump sums (taken from whom? by what mechanism?) be awarded to groups? Does it matter that 3.1 million African-Americans identify themselves as of mixed race? Or that in the 2010 census, 1.8 million people self-identified as both white and black? Who would administer reparations? And at what cost to social harmony? Racial preferences ("affirmative action") remain broadly unpopular after more than 50 years (the Philadelphia Plan to integrate building-construction unions began in 1967).
And which African-Americans shall count when counting for purposes of reparations? In 2005, The New York Times reported that since 1990, the average annual flow of immigrants from Africa -- about 50,000 -- had been more than came in chains in any of the peak years of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
There have been instances when reparations could be precisely targeted to defined cohorts that suffered clearly identifiable injuries. Consider an American infamy recounted in William K. Klingaman's "The Darkest Year: The American Home Front, 1941-1942." In 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle and Secretary of War Henry Stimson said "there has been no substantial evidence of sabotage" by people of Japanese extraction living on America's West Coast. But California Attorney General Earl Warren said the "very absence of sabotage" was "the most ominous sign in the whole situation": "I believe we are just being lulled into a false sense of security." So, 120,000 American residents of Japanese descent -- a majority of them U.S. citizens -- were interned in camps. In 1988, each living survivor was promised a paltry $20,000 in compensation. Two more zeros would have been appropriate.
But today's flippant talk about reparations illustrates a worsening pattern of behavior among congressional Democrats, including presidential candidates. (California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also express vague openness to reparations.) A quarter-baked idea (reparations, a Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all) is floated. There is a stampede to endorse it before thinking about the idea's dependence on enormous revenues of unknown origin and/or unavailable technologies. Then, when details, or the lack thereof, reveal the idea's wild impracticality, the stampeders breezily say: Nevertheless, the idea is virtuous because it is "aspirational." Which means that the Democratic Party is again assisting, as in 2016, Donald Trump's electoral aspirations.

Warren places big bet on small donors

Texto completo: DECORAH, Iowa — Standing in front of 200 voters in a packed Iowa storefront, Senator Elizabeth Warren was laying on a little guilt. Having sworn off private fund-raisers with millionaires, she explained, she was putting her campaign in the hands of regular voters like them.
“It's a big bet on Iowa democracy, that we can do this together, that we can do it through $5 and $25 donations and whatever people can afford," Warren said, before urging her audience to go to her website and “sign up."
It was an unsubtle hint: Give!
The swing through Iowa was the first road test for Warren's big, early bet that she can make up in volume what she may lose by eschewing closed-door events for high rollers. Her high-minded pledge to resist the grip of big money on politics is also an attempt to juice her grass-roots support, distinguish herself from the large and growing field of Democratic presidential contenders, and perhaps to temper expectations ahead of fund-raising filings later in the spring.
“I'm leaving money on the table, there's no doubt about that, but I want to run a campaign that's based on principles and ideas, not on how much money I can scoop up from people who've already made it big," Warren told reporters during her Iowa swing late last week, making a dig at opponents engaged in more traditional fund-raising.
Warren's vow has turned heads among Democrats, including Iowa voters who listened to her pitch. It seemed to some a breathtaking gamble in a race that could see candidates spending $100 million on the early states alone. There are many ways to break out of the pack of hopefuls, but all of them traditionally involve gobs of campaign cash for staff, media, technology, and travel.
What's more, Warren has been conspicuously silent about how she is actually doing with grass-roots donors, even as other candidates report multimillion-dollar hauls. That has fueled questions about whether her presidential run is drawing the kind of enthusiasm from donors that made her a top fund-raiser in the Senate.
The campaigns of Senators Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders boasted that they raised $1.5 million and $6 million, respectively, during their first 24 hours in the race, and even lesser-known Governor Jay Inslee of Washington bragged on Monday that he gathered $1 million in the opening days of his campaign. Warren, however, has said nothing of the sort. Instead, her campaign has sent e-mails to supporters expressing worry about meeting financing goals and admitting she is unlikely to be the top money-getter in the field. The next update on her fund-raising may not come until candidates must file financial reports in April.
“If you're kind of mum about it, things probably aren't going so great," said Patti Solis Doyle, the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in 2008.
Candidates can have their reasons for staying quiet about strong fund-raising totals, too, and Warren's campaign did tell supporters it met its undisclosed fund-raising goal by the end of February.
Warren shows no inclination to address such concerns directly. When she was asked in Iowa if her fund-raising was lagging, Warren changed the subject. “I'm just delighted to have this chance to get out and talk about what's broken in this country and what we can do about it," she said, adding, “Lots of people have contributed both money, and time and I'm deeply grateful for that."
David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama, was also unable to get an answer out of her on the topic in a recent interview. “I'm watching a very, very disciplined candidate deliver her message despite my best efforts," he said.
So far, the only peek into Warren's fund-raising operation shows she raised at least $299,000 on Dec. 31, the day she announced her exploratory campaign — much less, it seems, than Harris or Sanders when they jumped in. She does, however, have a cool $11 million left over from her Senate reelection campaign.
Expectations had been high for Warren because, as a senator, she has been a fund-raising juggernaut. She raised $42.5 million for her first election in 2012, and another $35 million between then and her reelection bid last year. She became a sought-after surrogate who helped Democrats around the country bring in campaign cash.
“I remember times where she would go on Rachel Maddow on an issue around the campaign — we'd send an e-mail out and we'd raise 2, 3, or $400,000 dollars just from that appearance," said Doug Rubin, a top adviser to Warren's 2012 campaign, who said he thought Warren's pledge would excite new donors and bring them into the fold.
Fueled by the ease of online giving and frustration with President Trump, grass-roots and small-dollar fund-raising helped to power Democratic gains in the midterms and could become a potent source of campaign cash for presidential candidates. But with more than a dozen candidates now competing for the same bursts of attention and money, relying on grass-roots funding alone may not be a sure bet.
Warren — who also has sworn off donations from political action committees and lobbyists — could have expected to have considerable success in raising money from wealthy donors, although probably not on Wall Street where she is anathema to many. She raked in serious cash at Hollywood receptions hosted by Ben Affleck, J.J. Abrams, Norman Lear, and other donors in past campaigns. Just last month, Warren helped pull in more than $400,000 for the New Hampshire Democratic Party by headlining the very kind of fancy dinner she's now eschewing for her campaign.
Still, her network of big donors is likely sparser than candidates who have been in politics longer, said Vincent Frillici, who was national finance director for former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Frillici says it's possible Warren saw it as “potentially politically useful or potentially a benefit to her online fund-raising effort to jettison or shun" the heavy hitters.
But such a strategy puts her squarely on the turf where Sanders already showed immense strength during his 2016 presidential run. A New York Times analysis of campaign finance data estimated that 2.1 million donors gave to Sanders between 2012 and 2018, compared to 343,000 for Warren in the same period.
Warren has not weaned herself off big donations altogether — just the private events for high rollers and call time that candidates of both parties use to reel them in.
Warren says her pledge does not extend into the general election. But in Iowa, even voters disgusted with the pernicious influence of money in politics wondered if Warren was needlessly disadvantaging herself ahead of a possible matchup with Trump.
“I think it's laudable, but I worry that in our system of politics, I hope that doesn't mean she's going to get stomped out," said Sandra Evans, a retired high school teacher who went to see Warren speak Friday morning in Dubuque.
In an election where voters are fixated on a candidate's ability to beat the president, any hint of weakness in a campaign could backfire.
“I'm old school that if you don't have the money, you can't run," said Jerry Lynch, 74, a former chairman of the operations committee for the Iowa Democratic Party. “When you get swamped and bombarded on TV and you can't buy ads — I don't know."
But Warren's allies say the move allows her to continue winning the “ideas primary" among Democrats, and will pay off long term among voters who are deeply skeptical of big donor influence in politics. In fund-raising e-mails, Warren's campaign has derided unnamed candidates for spending too much time talking to big contributors, and she has suggested skipping fund-raisers gives her more time to pack in campaign events and house parties, where she often sticks around to pose for photos with every voter who wants one. She's also been calling her small donors and thanking them on the phone — conversations she videos and shares on social media.
“It sets her apart immediately," said Nathan Thompson, the chairman of the Winneshiek County Democrats, in Decorah, even though, he noted, Sanders has also touted a small-dollar-focused fund-raising strategy.
Mark Green, a former New York politician who held a fund-raiser for Warren in his Manhattan home in 2018, said Warren's “gutsy" move may not pay off for months, when the collective weight of her positions help her stand out in a crowded field. He stressed that her money numbers right now are not what's important, but rather how she performs over time.
“She has a year now to show that doing good and doing well are not inconsistent," Green said.

Texto completo: Carlos Slim perdió $3,000 millones de dólares entre 2018 y 2019, pero eso fue como “quitarle un pelo a un gato”, ya que el empresario no bajó en su posición del ranking de Forbes sobre los más ricos.
La revista señala que Slim tiene una fortuna de $64,000 millones de dólares , cuando en el mismo mes de 2018 ascendía a $67,000 millones.
Parecería que eso lo haría perder posiciones, pero en realidad ganó dos lugares, al ocupar la posición 5 este año.
Slim es el mexicano más rico, de acuerdo con el conteo de Forbes, la cual destaca que él y su familia controlan América Móvil, la mayor empresa de telecomunicaciones telefonía celular de América Latina.
También que con socios de telecomunicaciones extranjeros, Slim compró una participación en Telmex, la única compañía telefónica de México, en 1990.
Además de poseer participaciones en empresas mexicanas de construcción, bienes de consumo, minería e inmobiliarias y el 17% de The New York Times.
En los últimos meses, Slim se enfrentó públicamente al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador por la cancelación del Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de México (NAIM), donde su empresa tiene alta participación.

Republicans, Democrats and 'Decent' Guys; Are any 2020 candidates interested in civility?

Texto completo: Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says he's considering an independent run for President to counter what he calls the "revenge politics" practiced by two bitterly divided political parties. The liberal Mr. Schultz has been excoriated on the left because many Democratic activists believe, perhaps mistakenly, that he would inadvertently help President Donald Trump get re-elected.
The vitriol that's been directed at Mr. Schultz seems to confirm his diagnosis of unhealthy U.S. political debate. And so does the latest news from Iowa, where yet another potential Democratic candidate appears uncomfortable saying anything gracious about someone on the other side of the partisan divide.
Last week, under leftist pressure on Twitter, former Vice President Joe Biden recanted after calling current Vice President Mike Pence a "decent guy."
Now it seems that Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who worked on policy projects with Mr. Pence while the latter was governor of Indiana, also can't bring himself to say anything nice about the Vice President—at least when Mr. Bullock is talking to Democratic voters.
Vaughn Hillyard of NBC News reports that when asked in Cedar Rapids, Iowa if he considers Mr. Pence a decent guy, Mr. Bullock at first avoided answering the question. When pressed, Mr. Bullock said he didn't know and then added, "I fundamentally disagree with the policies that he's putting forward and the way that he governs."
But two weeks ago while visiting Mr. Pence's official residence in Washington to discuss infrastructure spending, it seems that Mr. Bullock was sharing a different message. Fred Lucas of the conservative Daily Signal website reported on Feb. 22:
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat and current chairman of the National Governors Association, struck a note of bipartisan optimism, noting that he had worked with Pence when the vice president was governor of Indiana.
"We're encouraged, knowing that someone who sat in the governor's seat continues to reach out to us, both when we agree and when we disagree," Bullock said at the luncheon at the vice president's residence. "Together, we can certainly jump-start the wheels of cooperative governing again."
Mr. Bullock and all the other 2020 candidates could start by acknowledging to primary voters that political opponents can still be decent guys.

Indecent Tax Policy Yesterday this column noted the highly disappointing endorsement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin of a French plan to impose a minimum corporate income tax around the world. No surprise, the first order of business in Paris is to target a highly successful industry which is not based in France, but in the United States. Sam Schechner reports today in the Journal:
The French government on Wednesday introduced a new levy aimed at big tech giants, adding to momentum behind more than a dozen similar measures globally that could collectively cost Silicon Valley companies billions of dollars.
The measure, likely the first in a wave of proposed digital-services taxes to be applied in Europe, will apply a 3% tax on French-source revenue that companies like Alphabet Inc.'s Google or Amazon.com Inc. reap from specific services like targeted advertising or running a digital marketplace.
The new French tax will intensify pressure on the U.S. in a new round of multilateral talks, shepherded by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, about how to overhaul the corporate taxation system for the digital age. France and other European countries want a system that allocates more of Silicon Valley's profits to their territories for taxation.
Whatever one thinks about the technology industry, the role of social media companies in society or the possibility of additional regulation, none of the questions about Silicon Valley will be satisfactorily answered by a European plundering of American wealth and a global limit on pro-growth tax reform. Instead of offering cooperation, the Trump Treasury department should be leading the opposition to this French money grab.

Mr. Chaos vs. The Swamp

Texto completo: In the small favors department, Donald Trump can be thankful for how his renegade lawyer Michael Cohen chose to oblige committee Democrats by fanning the dying embers of Russiagate.
His tale about Roger Stone was refuted before it left his mouth thanks to Robert Mueller's indictment, which strongly indicated that Mr. Stone's alleged WikiLeaks connections were so much vaporware that Mr. Stone peddled to the Trump campaign to make himself appear important.
Likewise Mr. Cohen's vague and untestable "suspicion" that Mr. Trump knew in advance about a Russian lobbyist's visit to Trump Tower. It is best understood as a consolation prize offered up to Democrats after the crushing discovery that Don Jr.'s postmeeting phone calls weren't to his father after all.
"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great. . . . He had no desire or intention to lead this nation," revealed Mr. Cohen.
This is news only to anyone late to the plot. We pointed to Mr. Trump's telltale unhappy face on election night. Nobody has an incentive to spend unlimited sums investigating and destroying the wealth of the guy who finishes second in a presidential race.
The smart money has known all along that the question would become: What indictments related to his tax and business dealings would Mr. Trump be facing once he leaves the White House? That's where we are today.
"Look for the next several months to be a nonstop pageant of subpoenas, hearings and court challenges," chortles one New York Times writer. "The question of Trump's criminality [will be] at the center of political life," chortles another.
Of course, if Mr. Trump never wanted to be president, blown up is the theory that he engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow to make himself president. The veteran Washington Post correspondent Karen Tumulty acknowledged as much, calling this the "silver lining" in Mr. Cohen's testimony. And Jerrold Nadler, the lead Democratic inquisitor in the House, all but announced that he was launching his sweeping investigation, targeting 81 people and entities tied to Mr. Trump, to counter an anticlimactic Mueller report.
Let us understand: If Mr. Trump's approval ratings were 60% rather than 43%, a lot of House Democrats in unsafe seats would not be in favor now of an opportunistic hunt through his business career for whatever venalities might be found. Politics is a rough game. And Mr. Trump chose to conduct his presidency in a polarizing way.
At the same time, I wonder if Democrats realize how much incentive this gives him to pulverize his way to re-election. Or if they understand how apparent their cynicism will be to millions of middle-of-the-road voters.
Mr. Trump is a legitimate president even if he wishes he were still hosting his NBC show. By one casual standard, he may even be the most legitimate president we've ever had. No candidate was better known to voters or came less wrapped in false advertising.
In office, he has been a freak of democratic candor. What he thinks may not be accurate, but he compulsively lets voters know he thinks it.
The Russia conspiracy Democrats flogged for so long at least painted him as an impostor and traitor. Now Democrats are attacking him for being exactly the guy voters knew they were electing. Americans, after hearing Russia, Russia, Russia for 24 months, will not fail to notice that Mr. Trump is being assailed over routine financial and tax matters that nobody thought worth investigating before he became president.
Add it all up, and the end result of Democratic efforts may be only to reinforce the public's sense that something is seismically out of whack in Washington and that Donald Trump remains the available antidote.
Which brings us to the most important point of all.
If Mr. Trump didn't set out to be president, his accidental and involuntary servitude throws into sharper relief the story the press ignores. The deus ex machina that delivered him to the White House may well have been the antic and improper interventions of FBI chief James Comey, driven (as we belatedly learned) by a questionable Russian spy document left by Kremlin trolls where our so-called intelligence community could find it.
So maybe Russia did have a "useful idiot" operating on its behalf in the 2016 election. It wasn't Mr. Trump. It was Mr. Comey.
The chances of getting to the truth may not be great but they won't get better if Mr. Trump is no longer president. From a long view, putting up with the chaos-creator-in-chief might even be a small price to pay for exposing and repairing the constitutional wrongs of 2016.

Texto completo: The year was 1960. Lonnie C. King Jr., one of the leaders of the Atlanta Student Movement, refused to back down when the presidents of Morehouse College and other Atlanta University Center schools implored African-American students to return to class and let civil rights organizations such as the NAACP fight segregation.
Knowing the students' participation in protests might get them jailed, injured or killed, the school leaders thought they had a duty to keep students safe and focused on their educations, King recalled in a 2017 interview.
He didn't listen. He would go on to lead thousands of students and adults in marches on the State Capitol and downtown businesses. The protests and an economic boycott which cost downtown businesses millions of dollars over the 1960 Christmas holiday led to the desegregation of Atlanta stores and restaurants.
King died Tuesday morning at the age of 82 from heart problems, said his son Lonnie King III.Murray Brothers Funeral Home, will handle King's funeral.
Charles Person, a student activist with the movement, said he believes the importance of the movement in the larger civil rights movement has never been told.
He recalled the first march from the Atlanta University Center into town. Students in the thousands streamed down the street toward segregated stores. Looking back on the crowd, he and others realized the students were a force to be reckoned with, he said Tuesday.
Thanks to the students and some local leaders, there was no violence, and the movement was effective in bringing the beginning steps of change.
"It was pivotal," Person said, and added his friend will be greatly missed.
King was born Aug. 30, 1936, to Bertha Thrasher and Lonnie King in Arlington, Georgia, near Albany.
He spent his early years living with his grandparents in South Georgia while his mother moved to Atlanta and worked as a maid. At the time, King's mother -- whom he described as a brilliant strategist -- made $5 a day and car fare. His mother later remarried, and King Jr.'s stepfather was a supervisor at Southern Bakery.
King, who was not related to the family of the Rev.Martin Luther King Jr., moved to Atlanta as a young man, joined Ebenezer Baptist Church, started school and was elected president of the student council at Atlanta's David T. Howard High School. He ran only after overcoming his initial fear about running against a dapper classmate from a well-to-do family. That early opponent was Vernon Jordan, who went on to serve in President Bill Clinton's administration.
King's mother urged him to run against Jordan, telling him he could beat him if he campaigned with the younger students. Sure enough, he won the election in a landslide and stole Jordan's girlfriend in the process.
"Vernon hates me to this day," said King with a laugh in 2017. "I beat him in some other things as well."
After high school, King enrolled in Morehouse College.
In March 1960, King, Julian Bond and other students decided to launch the Atlanta Student Movement after learning college students from North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro staged sit-ins at a Woolworth's lunch counter there. That sit-in was a seminal spark in the civil rights movement.
"My dad saw that story and said we need to do that here," King III said. "The Jim Crow laws were in place, and the type of person that he was, he had a burning sense of correcting what was wrong."
Roslyn Pope and other Atlanta students were ready to move as well. They crafted a paper called "An Appeal for Human Rights," a bold call-out of the hypocritical image of tolerance that Atlanta liked to project to the broader world. They published the document in The Atlanta Journal and the Constitution newspapers and the Atlanta Daily World. It eventually was published in papers such as The New York Times.
"We want to state clearly and unequivocally that we cannot tolerate, in a nation professing democracy and among people professing Christianity, the discriminatory conditions under which the Negro is living today in Atlanta, Georgia -- supposedly one of the most progressive cities in the South," it said.
King wanted to call for protests on March 16, but the Rev. A.D. King counseled him to do it on the fifteenth to send a message: "Beware the ides of March," Lonnie King recalled in a 2014 interview.
So, on March 15, students from Atlanta's historic black colleges and universities, including female students Ruby Doris Smith and Gwen Isles, organized the first Atlanta sit-ins. Over 200 sat in at 11 downtown stores; 83 were arrested. Atlanta's African-American businesses raised money to pay the bonds for the students. In October, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. joined them at a sit-in at Rich's Department Store and was arrested, bringing more exposure to the student movement.
The young people led marches through downtown and helped stage an economic boycott over the 1960-61 holiday season that resulted in a loss of $20 million to area businesses.Some students also tried to visit the Pickrick Restaurant by Georgia Tech. Its owner, Lester Maddox, was a staunch segregationist who later became Georgia's last segregationist governor.
Though Maddox would not relent, the student-led demonstrations began winning concessions from downtown businesses. The protests lasted over four years.
Atlanta Councilman Michael Julian Bond, the son of student leader Julian Bond, recalled in 2014, "From his initial conversation with my father, Julian Bond, and Roslyn Pope over lunch at Yates and Milton drug stores, his catalytic leadership filled a space in Atlanta that previously was not occupied."
King eventually had to drop out of Morehouse for financial reasons. He joined the Navy to take advantage of the GI Bill after his mother had the recruiter ensure her that her son would not be a sea-going bus boy. Her son already had the opportunity to be discriminated against without joining the military, she pointedly told the man. King III said his father instead worked as a dispersing clerk and a prize fighter throughout his three years in the Navy.
After leaving the Navy, King eventually returned to Morehouse to finish his education. He went on to earn a master's in public education from the University of Baltimore. In 1970, he ran for Congress in a primary race that included Andrew Young.
"My father and I were very close," King III said. "I knew when my dad was running for Congress that I had a special father. I just didn't know how special until I became an adult."
King was proud of the role he played leading the Atlanta Student Movement and remained active in social justice work throughout his life. While serving as president of the Atlanta NAACP, King was instrumental in getting the Atlanta School Board to hire its first African-American superintendent, Alonzo Crim. In recent years, King worked on voter education and registration with students and other activists in Atlanta. His son said that until recently, King was working on his doctorate from Georgia State University and was ready to defend it before becoming ill.
King III said he is going to try to take his father's thesis, which is about the student movement, and turn it into a book.
"I am extremely proud of my dad," King III said. "I am glad that he was recognized for all of the hard work he did behind the scenes."
In one of his last conversations with the AJC, King Jr. said: "I'm sad when I reflect back and see how much hope and promise we had for ourselves and America, but then you begin to examine the ensuing years of the 1960s to where we are today, and you realize that the descendants of (segregationists) and their supporters never really gave up in trying to turn the clock back. I'm also disillusioned by the fact that we were perceived and lulled into a feeling that everything is going to be all right, and now we look up now and realize we deceived ourselves.We should've kept working and kept pushing, because we still have too many people who could be something else if they had been given the chance."
King was the father of three children, who survive him, along with six grandchildren and two former wives.

New York State regulators have issued an expansive subpoena to the Trump Organization's longtime insurance broker, the first step in an investigation of insurance policies and claims involving President Trump's family business, according to the company and a person briefed on the matter.
The subpoena was served late Monday on the company, Aon, one of the largest insurance brokerage firms in the world, as part of an inquiry by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
It came just days after Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer and lawyer, indicated in congressional testimony that the Trump Organization inflated the value of its assets to insurance companies.
The subpoena is the latest sign that the Trump Organization is facing scrutiny from multiple fronts -- federal prosecutors, congressional Democrats, and now, insurance regulators.
The Department of Financial Services does not conduct criminal investigations, nor does it have authority over Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization, but it can refer any possible illegal activity to prosecutors.
The federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating the Trump Organization's role in hush money payments to women who claimed to have affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal crimes in connection with those payments, has also told the prosecutors about irregularities in the company's insurance practices, The New York Times reported last month.
While the prosecutors are largely viewed as independent, the president and his allies have dismissed much of the other scrutiny as politically motivated.
The subpoena from the state agency that regulates insurance, which is part of the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat and vocal critic of Mr. Trump, landed on the same day that even broader scrutiny came to bear on the president, his administration and his business from House Democrats.
The House Judiciary Committee on Monday unleashed a blizzard of 81 letters demanding documents from people and businesses, including President Trump's company and several of his family members, kicking off the committee's sweeping investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by Mr. Trump.
The subpoena that was served on Aon contains no indication that the company or any of its employees engaged in misconduct, the person said. Nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry by state regulators.
Insurance brokers such as Aon help companies evaluate their risk and connect them with underwriters, the companies that offer the actual coverage. For this service, the brokers receive a fee or commission, usually paid by the client.
The nine-page subpoena demands a broad range of materials regarding Aon's business with Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization dating back to 2009, according to the person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
Among other things, it seeks copies of all communications between Aon and Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization, as well as all internal Aon documents relating to Mr. Trump and the company, the person said.
The regulators are also looking at compensation for the current and former Aon employees who handled the Trump Organization account, seeking information about their incentives, bonus payments or commissions. They are seeking similar contracts and agreements between Aon and Mr. Trump.
A spokeswoman for Aon, Donna Mirandola, said the company intended to cooperate, adding: "We do not comment on specific client matters." The White House referred a request for comment to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the Department of Financial Services declined to comment.
The Department of Financial Services is a powerful agency that regulates and supervises the insurance industry -- including brokers, brokerage firms and underwriters in New York -- as well as banking and other financial institutions.
The agency's authority is limited to civil regulatory actions, although it can refer possible criminal conduct to the office of a local district attorney or the State Attorney General.
However, under the New York State insurance law, the department, headed by Acting Superintendent Linda A. Lacewell, can take action against the companies and individuals it regulates, including brokers and underwriters. It can issue fines or a range of other penalties, including revoking their licenses to do business in New York.
This is not the first time that the agency has examined the business practices involving the Trump Organization. In 2017, the agency scrutinized the company's long relationship with Deutsche Bank, which the agency regulates and which is one of the president's few lenders on Wall Street. The examination concluded without the agency taking any action against the bank.
Mr. Cohen's testimony, however, provides additional fuel to advance the insurance inquiry.
At a hearing in front of the House Oversight Committee last week, when asked by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, whether the president ever inflated his assets to an insurance company, Mr. Cohen simply replied, "Yes."
The New York regulators are requesting copies of the insurance policies ultimately issued to Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization, as well as applications and financial statements used to secure the policies, the person said.
The subpoena requests that the materials -- undoubtedly a vast swath of documents, data, emails, policies and other records -- be turned over by March 19. The regulators will likely then issue additional subpoenas or requests to the underwriters and possibly other companies and individuals identified in response to this subpoena.
It could take the agency's investigators months to analyze all the information they collect.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In the small favors department, Donald Trump can be thankful for how his renegade lawyer Michael Cohen chose to oblige committee Democrats by fanning the dying embers of Russiagate.
His tale about Roger Stone was refuted before it left his mouth thanks to Robert Mueller's indictment, which strongly indicated that Mr. Stone's alleged WikiLeaks connections were so much vaporware that Mr. Stone peddled to the Trump campaign to make himself appear important.
Likewise Mr. Cohen's vague and untestable "suspicion" that Mr. Trump knew in advance about a Russian lobbyist's visit to Trump Tower. It is best understood as a consolation prize offered up to Democrats after the crushing discovery that Don Jr.'s postmeeting phone calls weren't to his father after all.
"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great. . . . He had no desire or intention to lead this nation," revealed Mr. Cohen.
This is news only to anyone late to the plot. We pointed to Mr. Trump's telltale unhappy face on election night. As he would have understood, nobody has an incentive to spend unlimited sums investigating and destroying the wealth of the guy who finishes second in a presidential race.
The smart money has known all along that the question would become: What indictments related to his tax and business dealings would Mr. Trump be facing once he leaves the White House? That's where we are today.
"Look for the next several months to be a nonstop pageant of subpoenas, hearings and court challenges," chortles one New York Times writer. "The question of Trump's criminality [will be] at the center of political life," chortles another.
Of course, if Mr. Trump never wanted to be president, blown up is the theory that he engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow to make himself president. The veteran Washington Post correspondent Karen Tumulty acknowledged as much, calling this the "silver lining" in Mr. Cohen's testimony. And Jerrold Nadler, the lead Democratic inquisitor in the House, all but announced that he was launching his sweeping investigation, targeting 81 people and entities tied to Mr. Trump, to counter an anticlimactic Mueller report.
Let us understand: If Mr. Trump's approval ratings were 60% rather than 43%, a lot of House Democrats in unsafe seats would not be in favor now of an opportunistic hunt through his business career for whatever venalities might be found. Politics is a rough game. And Mr. Trump chose to conduct his presidency in a polarizing way.
At the same time, I wonder if Democrats realize how much incentive this gives him to pulverize his way to re-election. Or if they understand how apparent their cynicism will be to millions of middle-of-the-road voters.
Mr. Trump is a legitimate president even if he wishes he were still hosting his NBC show. By one casual standard, he may even be the most legitimate president we've ever had. No candidate was better known to voters or came less wrapped in false advertising. In office, he has been a freak of democratic candor. What he thinks may not be accurate, but he compulsively lets voters know he thinks it.
The Russia conspiracy Democrats flogged for so long at least painted him as an impostor and traitor. Now Democrats are attacking him for being exactly the guy voters knew they were electing. Americans, after hearing Russia, Russia, Russia for 24 months, will not fail to notice that Mr. Trump is being assailed over routine financial and tax matters that nobody thought worth investigating before he became president.
Add it all up, and the end result of Democratic efforts may be only to reinforce the public's sense that something is seismically out of whack in Washington and that Donald Trump remains the available antidote.
Which brings us to the most important point of all.
If Mr. Trump didn't set out to be president, his accidental and involuntary servitude throws into sharper relief the story the press ignores. The deus ex machina that delivered him to the White House may well have been the antic and improper interventions of FBI chief James Comey, driven (as we belatedly learned) by a questionable Russian spy document left by Kremlin trolls where our so-called intelligence community could find it.
So maybe Russia did have a "useful idiot" operating on its behalf in the 2016 election. It wasn't Mr. Trump. It was Mr. Comey.
The chances of getting to the truth may not be great but they won't get better if Mr. Trump is no longer president. From a long view, putting up with the chaos-creator-in-chief might even be a small price to pay for exposing and repairing the constitutional wrongs of 2016.

Texto completo: A New York state financial regulator has asked the Trump Organization's longtime insurance broker for documents and internal communications pertaining to its dealings with President Trump's businesses, according to a person familiar with the matter.
On Monday, the New York state Department of Financial Services subpoenaed insurance brokerage Aon PLC for the information, the person said. This included internal communications and correspondence dating to 2009, according to the person.
A spokeswoman for Aon said the company had received the subpoena from the Department of Financial Services. "As is our policy, we intend to cooperate with all regulatory bodies," the spokeswoman said. "We do not comment on specific client matters."
A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization didn't respond to a request for comment.
The inquiry comes on the heels of the testimony of Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's longtime personal lawyer, before Congress last week. During the testimony, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, asked, "To your knowledge, did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?"
"Yes," Mr. Cohen said, without providing specifics.
News of the subpoena was first reported by the New York Times.
The investigation could represent another legal problem for Mr. Trump, his company, and the people in his orbit.
The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan is investigating the business dealings of the Trump Organization and the donors and spending of the president's inaugural committee, according to people familiar with the matter. The New York attorney general's office has sued the Trump Foundation, the president's family charity, accusing it of misspending funds to further Mr. Trump's interests . Mr. Trump called the suit "ridiculous."
The foundation agreed to dissolve in December, but that case remains pending.
In Washington, House Democrats have asked for records from more than 80 people and organizations related to the president's business dealings and other aspects of his orbit. Mr. Trump has labeled the effort a "big, fat, fishing expedition." Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible Russian interference in the election, and Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the matter.
The president has persistently denied any wrongdoing of any kind and has dismissed many of the accusations as politically motivated.
The Department of Financial Services regulates banks and oversees insurance companies operating in the state. The department, which has administrative enforcement power, typically refers criminal cases to state prosecutors offices, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former state and federal prosecutor and current managing director at Exiger, a global-compliance firm.
Insurance fraud entails filing a false statement with an insurance company in connection with a claim, Mr. Alonso said. Under the law, the person isn't required to have received the insurance money to have committed a crime.
"The crime is complete when you file the fraudulent statement," he added.

AT&amp;T wants CNN to build digital muscle

Texto completo: AT&T has begun transforming the former Time Warner operations into an entertainment enterprise that fits with the telecom giant's vision.
The telecom company had already incorporated the entertainment and news properties – HBO, the Warner Bros. studios, and Turner networks such as CNN and TBS – into a new entity within AT&T called WarnerMedia.
With last week's U.S. Court of Appeals denial of the DOJ's appeal of merger – and the department's declaration that it would no longer contest the deal – AT&T has begun to make moves to revamp the operation and merge the two companies la Comcast and NBCUniversal.
WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey on Monday named former NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt as the new chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment. Greenblatt, who helped manage NBCUniversal after Comcast's acquisition begun in 2009, will oversee HBO and Turner's channels TNT, TBS and truTV.
His guidance will be vital to achieving Stankey's goal of increased content production at HBO. Also in Greenblatt's purview is the company's direct-to-consumer business, which will need more content for the new subscription service AT&T plans to launch later this year – one that will face the planned Disney+ streaming service as a competitor.
Also announced: CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker will now be chairman of WarnerMedia News & Sports, which includes CNN and the company's sports content.
Additionally, Kevin Tsujihara, who remains as chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. studios, will also direct a new global kids and young adults business including Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and Boomerang, and oversee Otter Media and Turner Classic Movies. And Turner International president Gerhard Zeiler has been promoted to WarnerMedia's chief revenue officer and will handle its consolidated advertising sales efforts.
These appointments follow the departures last week of longtime HBO CEO Richard Pepler and Turner president David Levy.
Not only will there be new executive faces on board, but also new initiatives to boost CNN's digital operations. This is a key strategy for WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey, who plans to invest in product development and data analytics to increase CNN's digital delivery and engagement, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation.
CNN is already a digital leader online, hitting 120 million average monthly unique viewers in 2018, according to Comscore, 30 million ahead of Fox News and The New York Times online. But Stankey, who announced the executive appointments in a press release Monday, wants CNN's apps to better deliver customized news and content and to get its mobile consumers to spend about 10 minutes daily with CNN's apps, the Journal reported.
Using AT&T advertising technology, Stankey hopes to allow advertisers to better target viewers with relevant advertising, similar to how Facebook and Google operate, the Journal reported.
Another sign that AT&T's focused on its own services: the company is reportedly in talks with the Walt Disney Co. to sell its 10 percent stake in the streaming service Hulu, Variety reported. Disney (ABC) owns its original 30 percent stake in Hulu plus the 30 percent stake it got amid the Fox assets it paid $71 billion for last year. Comcast (NBCUniversal) owns the other 30 percent of Hulu.
"The potential deal makes sense for AT&T, which plans on launching its own streaming service in the second half of this year. We note that an actual deal could fail to materialize," wrote CFRA Research analyst Keith Snyder in a note to investors Thursday.
He estimated the price tag for AT&T's stake as $930 million, based on Hulu's recent valuation of $9.3 billion.

Texto completo: Alfred Uhry's "Driving Miss Daisy" is virtually encoded in the DNA of Atlanta. Based on the playwright's grandmother and her black chauffeur, the story unfolds as a kind of tour of city landmarks and key moments in its history, from 1948 to 1973.
Whether she wants him to or not, Hoke Colburn escorts the irascible Daisy Werthen from her Druid Hills homes to the Euclid Avenue Piggly Wiggly for cans of salmon and cleaning supplies. Together they find themselves on a collision course with the infamous 1958 bombing of The Temple on Peachtree. Together they arrive at a fancy 1964 Biltmore Hotel gala celebrating the Rev.Martin Luther King Jr.'s Nobel Peace Prize.
But more than that, they become best friends and discover that the capacity for love and understanding is a universal matter, even if the path of racial harmony, then and now, is a road less traveled.
Uhry's 1987 off-Broadway play won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for drama and became a 1989 Hollywood blockbuster that scooped up four Oscars, including best picture. In 1988, Robert J. "Bob" Farley brought "Miss Daisy" home to Atlanta for an Alliance Theatre production that set the playhouse record for longest-running show and later traveled to China and the Soviet Union.
Farley died in 2017. His wife, Anita, took command of Roswell's Georgia Ensemble Theatre (GET), which the couple founded together in 1992. And now Laurel Crowe, their daughter, has revived the familiar chestnut her father made famous. (Remember what I said about DNA.)
As director, Crowe has the good fortune of working with Jill Jane Clements (Miss Daisy), Rob Cleveland (Hoke) and William S. Murphey (Miss Daisy's frustrated son, Boolie), actors who have performed in several Bob Farley-directed productions of "Miss Daisy" over the years. They know how to drive the car.
Crowe's staging is a lovely tribute to a sweet play. Too sweet for some.
Though the cast is quite fine and Clements' account of the nursing home-bound Daisy in the final moments of her long and complicated life still chokes me up, this play may be starting to show its age just a tad.
To be certain, Uhry's tale tugs at the heartstrings. It also reduces a welter of complex racial issues into a simplistic formula that Hollywood can bank on (see "Green Book"), and which makes white audience members feel good about themselves. The wildly popular "To Kill a Mockingbird" took a similar approach, albeit messier.
But what to do when Atticus Finch is unmasked as a racist, as he was in Harper Lee's long-suppressed "Mockingbird" first draft, "To Kill a Watchman"?
In "Daisy," Hoke trots out some loaded Jewish stereotypes to a bemused Boolie Werthan, and though Miss Daisy declares again and again that she is not prejudiced, one can plainly see that she is. As Wesley Morris pointed out in an astute and provocative recent New York Times essay "Why Do the Oscars Keep Falling for Racial Reconciliation Fantasies?", Hoke works for the Werthans out of economic necessity. "Green Book" flips it so that a white man gets paid to drive a black musician through the American South.
As it happens, GET's lovingly crafted "Daisy" revival comes to the fore at a moment of intense political and racial reckoning. Just as Hoke starts the ignition and begins a delicate dance of accelerating and braking, the play affords an opportunity to start a conversation that moves us forward while keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror of the past, smudges and all.
More than three decades after "Daisy" glided onto stage and screen, it still has something to say. The ride may not always be as smooth and comfortable as some might prefer. Neither is real life. The journey is bumpy, the potholes omnipresent. For us to get anywhere, the soul work -- the self-scrutiny -- must be ongoing.
To my mind, "Daisy" is an elegant, well-oiled machine that is likely to survive the chinks of time.
Hoke and Daisy: Together again?
Why not? Who knows what surprises they have yet to reveal?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The National Security Agency is considering ending a once-secret surveillance program that annually collects hundreds of millions of telephone call records, including those belonging to Americans, because it lacks operational value, according to people familiar with the matter.
Terminating the program, which was exposed publicly by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden nearly six years ago, would represent a stunning concession from a spy agency that once argued the collection of call metadata was vital to national security.
Luke Murry, a national-security adviser for Republican congressional leadership, said in a recent podcast interview with the Lawfare security blog that the NSA hadn't used the program in the past six months and might not seek its renewal when portions of the Patriot Act that authorize it expire at the end of the year.
The NSA and the National Security Council declined to comment. On Tuesday morning, a spokesman for House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Mr. Murry's remarks on the podcast weren't speaking to Trump administration policy nor how Congress intends to address the issue.
The people familiar with the NSA's internal deliberations cautioned that no final decision had been made and that the discussions about potentially ending the metadata program were in the early and informal stages.
Metadata include the numbers and time stamps of a call or text message but not the contents of the conversation.
Portions of the Patriot Act are due to expire at the end of 2019, including the section of the law that authorizes the metadata program. Congress is expected to pass provisions that would extend the expiring provisions of the law, but debate isn't expected to begin in earnest until the fall, according to congressional aides on relevant committees.
The NSA's practice of vacuuming up telephone metadata in bulk was exposed in 2013 by Mr. Snowden, who leaked a trove of classified surveillance secrets to journalists.
Mr. Snowden has resided in Russia under asylum since the leaks after having his passport revoked by the U.S. government while traveling.
After nearly two years of debate fueled by Mr. Snowden's disclosures, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act in 2015, requiring the spy agency to replace its bulk metadata program with a pared-down system under which call records were retained by the telephone companies. The new measures have allowed the NSA to request those records on an as-needed basis rather than ingest them wholly into its own servers.
Privacy advocates have said the new system continues to pose troubling issues and that evidence of its value to national security is thin or nonexistent.
"It seems clear to me that this is not a program that is needed for national security," said Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, in a recent interview. "One of the goals of the Freedom Act was to limit large-scale collection, and I think there are questions as to whether that law is achieving its goals."
Any final decision about whether to end the program would be made by the White House, not the NSA. It is unclear if the Trump administration would be willing to relinquish an authority that the intelligence community has repeatedly argued was important to national security. But under scrutiny after the revelations of Mr. Snowden, intelligence officials struggled to demonstrate any examples when the program—in its old, more expansive form—had disrupted a terrorist plot.
Despite the rollback under the USA Freedom Act, the NSA reported collecting 151 million call records in 2016 related to 42 terrorism suspects and 534 million in 2017 connected to 40 suspects. The NSA has previously announced deleting some records collected under the program due to technical issues involving what data telecommunications firms shared with the spy agency.
Shutting down the metadata collection wouldn't be the first time the NSA halted a controversial surveillance program. The agency announced in 2017 it would stop a form of signals collection that let it collect without a warrant the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in messages to or from people living overseas.
That program, known as "about" collection, was frozen because of struggles to comport to privacy expectations laid out in 2011 by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Texto completo: There is speculation that Hillary Clinton will run again for president. That would definitely liven up the contest. She has the strong support of her husband, and she has many loyal followers who suffered extreme mental anguish when she lost the last election.
It would seem prudent and timely to examine a few details regarding the Clintons which surfaced and quickly disappeared in the news when they happened.
Nov. 19, 1993: President Bill Clinton allowed the sale of a "super computer" to the communist Chinese and called it a goodwill gesture, allowing the Chinese to access the most advanced computer technology without having to spy to get it.
May 11, 1999: President Clinton approved the transfer of our most advanced missile guidance technology to the communist Chinese, essentially wiping out any strategic advantage the U.S. had.
April 23, 2015: According to a New York Times article headlined "Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal," tens of millions of dollars flowed into the Clinton Foundation following the sale of 20 percent of the U.S. uranium reserves to the Russians.
Nov. 2, 2017: Vanity Fair published an article titled "Donna Brazile says she has 'Proof' Clinton rigged the primary against Sanders."

The SALT deduction is theft, explained

Texto completo: Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, the mother of the new socialist superstar in Congress, did what dozens of parents I know have done: move from New York to Florida.

Birds may migrate south for the winter, but financially savvy empty-nesters move to the Sun Belt for financial benefit. Ocasio-Cortez's mother — shall we call her BOC? — conceded as much.

"After the children graduated from college, I figured it was time for me to move to Florida," BOC told the Daily Mail. "I was paying $10,000 a year in a real estate taxes up north. I'm paying $600 a year in Florida. It's stress-free down here."

Maggie Haberman of New York Times had some thoughts.

Because Haberman is an objective news reporter, and usually a fair and excellent one, I'm going to go ahead and give her the benefit of the doubt that she simply didn't read the whole piece, which states that BOC, who purchased her house in 2016, moved there "shortly before Democrat AOC filed her candidacy" months before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was even signed into law. But for the sake of this article, let's pretend that Haberman was correct and explain why New York didn't get "soaked" by the TCJA, but rather that Florida got justice.

A pivotal point of the TCJA was the capping of the state and local tax deduction. Prior to 2018, Americans could, in general, deduct the entirety of their state and local taxes from their federal tax bill, but the TCJA capped that deduction at $10,000. Naturally blue states blew up at the prospect.

Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo blamed the SALT deduction cap for the loss of $2.8 billion in state tax revenue. Critics of the cap say it punishes high-tax states. Really, it just makes them pay their fair share.

Let's use a purely hypothetical example. Consider that there are two states, Red and Blue. The effective state tax rate of an average Red resident is 5 percent, and the effective state tax rate of an average Blue state is 15 percent. Now, let's say that the effective average tax rate of the federal government is 30 percent. If two people in the two states earn the same amount of money, under the old system, the federal government would effectively subsidize the Blue state's higher tax rate, allowing the Blue state residents to pay less federal taxes. Not only would residents of the Red state be effectively paying for the Blue state's fiscal irresponsibility, but within the Blue state, the SALT deduction would favor more prosperous areas, rendering it regressive.

So even if BOC moved to Florida four years after her youngest child graduated from college, it wouldn't be because the new law unfairly punished New York. Instead it would be because the new law finally made New Yorkers pay their fair share of federal taxes.

But why cap it at $10,000? We ought to just end the SALT deduction altogether, and force Cuomo and the likes to get their budgets in order.

The anti-CPAC: A conference for conservatives that prioritize debate not grandstanding

Texto completo: The Conservative Political Action Conference, the behemoth of a conference that serves as a gathering place for a certain brand of right-of-center politics and a bellwether for the conservative movement broadly, wrapped up over the weekend. The event brought plenty of criticism and, given the persistence of bizarre and uncomfortable moments, it was warranted. From President Trump embracing the American flag, to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham saying that Kim Jong Un might "not be anywhere much longer," to a call from the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee for more right-wing grifters in the mold of Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk, the event was not a model of robust policy discussion or an attempt to offer a conservative policy vision.

But if CPAC isn’t a good model, and it’s definitely not, than what is?

For conservatives looking for substance over soliloquies and facts rather than farce, the Niskanen Center’s conference hosted last Monday offers a useful counter-example. The event, organized under the theme “Beyond Left and Right: Reviving Moderation in an Era of Crisis and Extremism,” nominally focused on moderation. Although, it was perhaps better characterized as a debate about the future of right-of-center politics.

And debate was definitely the optimal word, even if it wasn't the moderation or centrism its organizers had in mind.

But to be clear, by debate, I don’t mean 40-second, made-for-television partisan potshots, viral tweets, or disagreements that are more about dunking on an opponent than hearing what they have to say.
 
Instead, what I’m talking about is thoughtful questions aimed in inquiry rather than “gotcha” moments, healthy discussions among attendees who disagreed but still wanted to hear each other out, panelists who talked policy and recognized the need for a solution rather than merely stating what was disagreeable about a different proposal.

Indeed, perhaps the only thing that the speakers — including New York Times columnist David Brooks, former British Prime Minster Tony Blair, host of the PBS' "Firing Line" Margaret Hoover, and several professors — agreed on was that something was broken about our current political system. Beyond that, everyone seemingly had a different diagnosis of the problem and, consequently, a different answer. 
 
Brooks, who opened the event, for example, as his column echoes, preached the politics of "Love thy neighbor." Blair, the final speaker, was more pragmatic, arguing that the problem is that moderation “is not on offer at the moment” — not that it has been flat-out rejected. 
 
But it wasn’t just the problem or potential solutions that were the subject of disagreement: The whole idea of moderation and centrism and what such terms even mean were all up for debate. 

Jacob T. Levy, a professor at McGill University, pointed out that perhaps it wasn’t moderation at all that we need but better partisanship. As he put it, “Moderation treated as a banner unto itself, as a label around which to organize political activity not only to quality how we do political activity, tends to be much more dangerous and sometimes pernicious.”

He emphasized that partisanship is part of democracy, telling the crowd, “Part of the reason we face our current crises is because of the deinstitutionalization and weakening of political parties, their hollowing out.” He warned we should not stave off partisanship in the name of fighting extremism, which he characterized as the true opposite of moderation.

Aurelian Craiutu, a professor of political science at Indiana University, spoke on the same panel as Leby and offered a different view of moderation: accepting the complexity of political problems. “Deeply ingrained in moderation," he said, "is the refusal to simplify reality.”

For Hoover, the problem was the lack of a coherent conservative vision. As she explained, “There isn’t an organizing principle on the Right." Later she added, “Often my experience on the Right is that the Right spends its time articulating and fighting what it doesn’t like on the Left rather than coming up with constructive solutions to counter them.”

These ideas, as well as passionate questions on the treatment of disinformation, a dedication to considering solutions to mitigate climate change rather than attacking the fact that it is happening, and a real effort to embrace productive disagreement, are what the great American experiment of democracy is all about.

The Niskanen Center, of course, is not unique in offering a forum for robust discussion of policy and, indeed, disagreement. There are dozens of think tanks that excel at producing just such events on a range of individual topics. But Monday’s conference was refreshingly different in that it aimed to bring policy discussions back into the mainstream of politics and organizing them around a cohesive vision.

That’s an ambitions goal and a thorough rejection of the grandstanding that so often dominates televised and nonpolicy specific events such as CPAC, which lacked both moderation and substantive debate.

In the end, I think that Levy is right: It's not moderation that is missing among the range of political ideas on offer but true partisanship and a healthy debate within and between parties. That's exactly what the Niskanen Center's conference on moderation provided, and that's what is clearly missing from mainstream American discourse.

Texto completo: Former Gov. John Hickenlooper declared himself a presidential candidate Monday, and here’s how national news outlets reacted.
The Washington Post: “As governor, Hickenlooper presided over steady economic growth, the legalization of marijuana — which he initially opposed — and a surge that put Democrats in full control of a once-conservative state. ... Few Democrats with 2020 ambitions have touted ... team-ups with Republicans, and few have tangled as much with their party’s left. In 2018, Hickenlooper threatened to call a special legislative session to undo an anti-fracking ballot measure, if voters passed it; he backed down only after the measure failed.”
The New York Times: Hickenlooper is “a socially progressive, pro-business Democrat who has called himself an ‘extreme moderate’ ... But even in Colorado, fellow Democrats have expressed skepticism that his signature low-key approach will translate to national success. ‘I don’t think John has at all defined why he is running,’ said Rick Ridder, a political strategist and longtime friend of Mr. Hickenlooper. ‘There are very few people I know who wake up and want to go caucus to support a raging moderate.’”
Wall Street Journal: “While most of the candidates preceding him into the race are defining themselves as progressives, Mr. Hickenlooper is the first of several candidates expected to join the contest from the party’s more centrist ranks. Unlike several of the other Democrats in the race, he hasn’t embraced a call for a single-payer health system. His campaign-launch video paints the 67-year-old as the architect of an urban renewal in Denver, as a two-term mayor of the city, and the steward of Colorado’s booming economy as a two-term governor.”
CNN: “Hickenlooper is seen as a dark horse for the presidency, in part because he doesn’t have the national profile of other Democratic candidates, but he and his team hope that his record of achievement in Colorado, including his ability to work with Republicans, will set him apart.”
USA Today: “He is expected to campaign on his ability to implement Democratic goals in a politically divided state and to try to stand out from the largely progressive group of Democratic candidates by portraying himself as a pragmatist. Hickenlooper has hedged on supporting Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.”
NBC News: “(Hickenlooper is) positioning himself as fighter for progressive priorities who won’t shy away from a brawl with President Donald Trump. ... His introductory video ... leans heavily on what he accomplished during his two terms as governor of Colorado. He touts crafting environmentally friendly methane emissions laws in tandem with environmentalists and oil and gas companies; expanding Medicaid in Colorado; and passing tough gun control legislation after a mass shooter killed 12 people in Aurora.”
CBS News: “He was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. ... Hickenlooper was the first Denver mayor to be elected Colorado governor in 120 years. And he won election as mayor of Denver with no political experience. He was re-elected in 2014 after running an entirely positive campaign.”
Los Angeles Times: “He enters the race with relatively low name recognition compared with potential rivals including Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden — and, unlike former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Sen. Bernie Sanders, hasn’t much of a national fundraising list to draw on. But Hickenlooper, 67, is betting that his biography-driven campaign and carefully cultivated brand of progressive pragmatism will help him rise in a wide-open primary field.”
Washington Examiner: “Hickenlooper’s presidential bid quickly drew derision from the Republican National Committee on Monday. ‘John Hickenlooper is the latest tax-and-spend liberal to join the race,’ said RNC Communications Director Michael Ahrens. ‘But according to Hickenlooper, he’s actually ‘a lot more progressive’ than his far-left opponents. In a primary dominated by socialist policies like the $93 trillion ‘Green New Deal,’ that puts him way outside the mainstream.’”
FiveThirtyEight: “In early surveys of the Democratic field — which mostly reflect name recognition at this point — he is polling between 0 and 1 percent.1 Only 22 percent of Democratic respondents even have an opinion of him, according to an average of national favorability polls since the beginning of the year. And he’s not on the radar of many Democratic activists in early states, either. What Hickenlooper does have going for him is that he may be more skilled than most at getting his name out there. He’s run some of the best political ads in recent memory, including endearing spots about parking meters and his humble wardrobe, which helped him stand out in a wide-open field (sound familiar?) during his first run for mayor. And later ads in which he went skydiving and took a shower — fully clothed — were nothing if not memorable.
His quirky personality was his secret political weapon in Colorado, but it’s unclear how it’ll shake out on a national stage, where his demographics — older, white, male — may pigeonhole him as a retread.”
The Associated Press: “Though as governor Hickenlooper prided himself for staying above partisan fights, he has argued his record as a former governor and big-city mayor distinguishes him from a broad field of Democratic presidential aspirants who are backing ambitious liberal plans on health care, taxes and the climate.”
Politico: “The former Colorado governor begins at a disadvantage [in early-caucus state Iowa], with low name recognition and a smaller campaign infrastructure than most rivals. While his name is a familiar one to older Iowa voters — a cousin, the late Bourke Hickenlooper, served as a Republican governor in the 1940s and later represented the state in the Senate for 24 years — John Hickenlooper was excluded from the latest poll.”

Will Democratic Primary Voters Tolerate a Liberal? A former Colorado governor will test whether the Sandernistas have taken over the party.

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is claiming a socialist victory in the battle of ideas. Meanwhile former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is running for President and testing whether economic non-extremists can still win Democratic presidential primaries.
Sunday in Chicago, Mr. Sanders implied that people no longer view him as a Marxist kook. The Chicago Tribune reports on a Sanders speech at Navy Pier:
"Three years ago, they thought we were kind of crazy and extreme, not the case anymore," he said. "We are not only going to defeat (President Donald) Trump, we are going to transform the United States of America."
Mr. Sanders has certainly made extremism cool among Democratic presidential candidates. All of his fellow senators seeking the party's nomination have joined him in co-sponsoring the Green New Deal and its promise of government health care and the end of traditional energy sources. They have also voted for an abortion policy so expansive that it allows adults to decide the fate of children even when they are no longer in the womb.
On Wednesday this column described an opportunity for potential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden to offer a non-radical message and added that "seizing the opportunity will require him to offer not just a different tone compared to his 2020 rivals, but a different agenda." So much for a different tone. Later in the week, under leftist Twitter duress, Mr. Biden repudiated his earlier comment that Vice President Mike Pence is a "decent guy."
This brings us to Mr. Hickenlooper. The Journal's Reid Epstein writes that the former Colorado governor is "the first member of the crowded field to run by trumpeting a record of working with Republicans." Mr. Epstein adds:
"I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington, but we also need to get things done," Mr. Hickenlooper said in a video released Monday morning. "I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver."
Mr. Hickenlooper, the 14th Democrat to formally launch a presidential campaign, is a former geologist turned brewpub owner who was mayor of Denver before being elected governor.
Refreshingly in a Democratic field dominated by ideologues, lawyers and legislators, Mr. Hickenlooper is an executive and was a successful entrepreneur. He has enacted significant environmental regulation of the energy industry in Colorado, but he has not sought the industry's demise. He is a liberal, not a Marxist. Particularly on social issues, Democratic activists should find plenty to like in his record. Mr. Hickenlooper's appointees to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission have aggressively sought to force the state's bakers to make gay wedding cakes.
The Denver Post sums up his career:
In addition to leading the state during an explosive economic expansion following the Great Recession, Hickenlooper nudged the state to the left. By the time his second term ended in January, he had expanded the state's Medicaid program, signed comprehensive gun-control legislation and helped establish civil unions for same-sex couples prior to the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing marriage equality.
It seems that Mr. Hickenlooper did little to impede the state's economic expansion, partly because voters rejected his plan for a tax hike. In its 2016 fiscal policy report card on America's governors, the libertarian Cato Institute noted :
General fund spending has ballooned under Governor John Hickenlooper, rising 48 percent between 2011 and 2016. State government employment has soared 22 percent since Hickenlooper took office. Hickenlooper pushed for a large individual income tax increase on the ballot in 2013, which would have replaced Colorado's flat-rate 4.63 percent tax with a two-rate structure of 5.0 and 5.9 percent. That increase was rejected by voters, 65 to 35 percent.
In its 2018 report, Cato observed :
Under the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), strong revenue growth triggers automatic refunds to taxpayers, and state officials are expecting to issue refunds in the coming years. TABOR is a useful safeguard against government overexpansion, but Hickenlooper wants to change the law so that the state can spend more.
Colorado will receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year in extra tax revenue as a result of the 2017 federal tax law, and this money will automatically flow into the state's coffers because it is a rolling conformity state. But rather than using this windfall to reduce state tax rates, the governor and legislature have decided to spend it.
The state government also has a new source of revenue: marijuana. Citizens legalized it for recreational use on the 2012 ballot. The state is collecting growing amounts of revenue from the product, up to $247 million by 2017. Hickenlooper signed a bill raising the marijuana sales tax rate from 10 percent to 15 percent.
Now Mr. Hickenlooper, who has so far avoided calling for a federal takeover of the health care industry, is going to see if Democratic primary voters nationwide will go for a candidate promising somewhat bigger government rather than much bigger government. David Leonhardt suggests in the New York Times today that there is a market for what Mr. Hickenlooper is selling:
...Gallup found late last year that most Democratic voters — by a margin of 54 percent to 41 percent — would rather their party move to the center than to the left. (Most Republicans, by contrast, want their party to continue moving right.) In another recent poll, by Monmouth, most Democratic voters said they would prefer a nominee likely to win the general election to one who shared their views on most issues.
If Democratic activists can forgive Mr. Hickenlooper for his successful business career, they may decide he's a decent guy.

The great hypocrisy of the Green New Deal

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed. But, hey, who’s gonna turn down free money?
The economic pain of green cronyism cuts deeper than wasted taxpayer money. When Washington steers money to — or away from — “favored” businesses or technologies, private-sector investment follow. This not only stifles competition and innovation, it also centralizes control in the hands of politicians, elites and lobbyists.
That’s the big picture. But the Green New Deal has very personal ramifications as well. It would change the way you live your life — from what car you drive, to how cool or warm you you’re your home, to what you eat.
The stench of hypocrisy makes it all that much worse.

Texto completo: John Mulaney returns to "Saturday Night Live," less than a year after his first hosting gig. And as "Transit" hits theaters, revisit Christian Petzold's 2012 character study, "Barbara."
What's on TV
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. The singer-songwriter Thomas Rhett performs a day after the release of his new single, "Look What God Gave Her," while the sparkly eyed comic John Mulaney hosts. Even with all his acting roles ("Big Mouth," "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"), Mulaney never strayed too far from his friends at "S.N.L." He wrote for the show for five years, starting in 2008, but what he really wanted was to be on camera -- so much so that he jokingly claimed to have auditioned 44 times. (He eventually landed some appearances.) Now he's returning to host for the second time; his first gig, in April 2018, featured jokes that made it into his popular Netflix special "Kid Gorgeous at Radio City."
JUST ADD ROMANCE (2019) 8 p.m. on Hallmark. Sparks flew when two aspiring chefs, Carly (Meghann Fahy) and Jason (Luke Macfarlane), met at culinary school in New York. Then Jason suddenly left the city to take care of family matters, and Carly didn't hear a peep. Now, three years later, they cross paths again as contestants on a cooking show in Chicago, and the flirtation is back on. But as they compete for the chance to have their own restaurant, the contest gets in the way of their chemistry.
LOVE & MARRIAGE: HUNTSVILLE 10 p.m. on OWN. Three couples try to bring life back to Huntsville, Ala., through a joint real estate venture while navigating their relationships in this reality show. In the first season finale, their enterprise and their personal lives are on shaky ground. As Martell prepares for surgery, Melody warns him that she may not be able to look past his cheating and that things will change after his recovery. And Tisha's hopes to become a working mother put her marriage on the rocks.
What's Streaming
BARBARA (2012) stream on Mubi; rent on iTunes, Google Play, Mubi, Vudu or YouTube. Christian Petzold's new thriller, "Transit," about a refugee who flees to France and assumes a dead novelist's identity, recalls the German director's slow-burning drama, "Barbara." Nina Hoss stars as the title character, a doctor banished from a prestigious Berlin institution to a pediatric hospital in the countryside of East Germany in 1980. She takes her new post under the watchful eye of the secret police and yearns to flee to the West, but she is soon torn by her devotion to a desperate patient (Jasna Fritzi Bauer) and a bubbling romance with a young doctor (Ronald Zehrfeld). Manohla Dargis named the film a Critic's Pick in her review for The New York Times, writing that "while Barbara may just look like she's letting down her defenses, what you witness is the revelation of a moral imperative that is itself profoundly political."

Texto completo: Research that could make flu viruses more dangerous, and that the government suspended in 2014 because of safety concerns, has been approved to begin again, federal officials have confirmed.
The government did not publicly announce its decisions in recent months to allow two labs to resume their projects. The new go-ahead was first reported in the journal Science.
The lack of information about the decision and how it was made have provoked outrage from some scientists, who oppose the research because they say it could create mutant viruses that might cause deadly pandemics if they were unleashed by lab accidents or terrorism. The research sparked worldwide fears when it was first revealed in 2011.
Two research teams, in Wisconsin and the Netherlands, have been told by the Department of Health and Human Services that their work is eligible for research funding from the United States government. The Wisconsin group was notified in October, and the Dutch group in January, a spokeswoman for H.H.S. said in an email.
Despite requests from The New York Times on Thursday and Friday, officials from H.H.S. did not explain why they had not announced their decisions on the two labs at the time they were made.
Spokeswomen for H.H.S. and the National Institutes of Health said the decision to lift the moratorium had already been announced in December 2017 when N.I.H. disclosed that the studies would be allowed, but only after newly created expert panels judged each proposal to be safe and scientifically sound.
At that time, the government had not yet approved any specific projects.
The N.I.H. said it does not generally issue news releases to announce new research grants, but does post them on its NIH Reporter website.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was a sound decision to let the research resume. The money for some of the Wisconsin research -- $605,206 -- will come from his institute.
"Look, everyone said we needed a system for this kind of research to be vetted, vetted by outsiders who were experts," he said. "So we got a system."
Marc Lipsitch of Harvard and Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins University said the workings of that system should be made public.
"Making decisions to approve potentially dangerous research in secret betrays the government's responsibility to inform and involve the public when approving endeavors, whether scientific or otherwise, that could put health and lives at risk," the scientists wrote in the Washington Post on Wednesday.
In an interview, Dr. Lipsitch said lab accidents do occur, often involving human errors that biosafety and security measures cannot prevent. In several cases, he said, people mistakenly sent germ samples from a lab thinking they had been inactivated when the samples were actually live and dangerous.
"This is a global issue, and standards we set in the United States will be imitated, whether they are high or low," Dr. Lipsitch said. "The people at risk are not only Americans. If there's a big pandemic, it's a big pandemic for everybody. This needs to be decided at the global level, between governments and the World Health Organization."
A global furor erupted in 2011 when two labs revealed that they had altered a deadly type of bird flu virus in a way that made it more contagious among ferrets, which catch the flu in much the same way people do and are used to study how it might spread among humans.
One lab was led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, and the other by Ron Fouchier, at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam.
That particular bird flu, a type called H5N1, rarely jumps from birds to humans, but is highly lethal when it does. Infected people do not seem to spread the disease to others, but if it did become transmissible between humans, it could cause a pandemic with an enormously high death rate.
Flu viruses in nature mutate a lot, sometimes changing how contagious and how deadly they are. Researchers say that manipulating those traits in the lab could identify specific genetic changes that make a virus more dangerous.
Some scientists strongly defended the importance of the research cleared to proceed.
"Dr. Kawaoka's goals for the project include understanding what molecular changes to the virus could render it capable of becoming pandemic in people so that public health officials can monitor for these changes in nature and begin to stockpile vaccines and antivirals to combat it," Rebecca L. Moritz, a microbiologist specializing in biosafety and biosecurity who works with Dr. Kawaoka, said in an email.
"The project could also yield further insights into highly pathogenic influenza viruses and lead to the development of new vaccines or antiviral drugs."
Ms. Moritz said there were many layers of security at the university lab in Madison to prevent release of the virus. She said the research was regulated by about a half dozen boards from the government and the university. Employees have to pass a background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and be approved by a federal agency that specializes in dangerous pathogens.
People experimenting with the viruses work in a closed lab, completely covered by spacesuit-like garments and hoods with their own purified air supply. They must take a decontaminating shower before leaving the lab.
Ms. Moritz said local fire departments were directed not to enter the virus lab for any reason and if there was a fire, to let it burn. If someone working in the virus lab has a medical crisis, "first-responders are not able to reach them until they have been decontaminated by qualified lab staff," she said.
The bird flu studies have not yet resumed. Once H.H.S. approves such projects, the National Institutes of Health decides whether to pay for them. N.I.H. has agreed to support the Wisconsin work, but has not yet decided on the studies in the Netherlands.
Dr. Fouchier could not be reached for comment by The Times. He told Science that the N.I.H. decision was expected after an inspection of his lab, scheduled for March.
Dr. Fauci said of Dr. Kawaoka: "Yoshi went through the appropriate vetting exercise. It went through multiple layers of review and examination. It wasn't as if we all changed our minds and said, 'Oops, never mind, go ahead and do it.' They got very appropriately vetted with all the appropriate caveats."

EXCHANGE --- Human Capital -- The Captain Class: Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Boss? --- Former aides claim Sen. Amy Klobuchar is hard to work for. But there's a case to be made that not every leader has to be nice

Texto completo: After declaring her candidacy for president in a howling blizzard on an 18-degree day, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar probably assumed the next storm she'd face would be something less dramatic, maybe a rigorous public vetting of her legislative record.
Instead, the forecast got worse. Several of her former Senate aides gave anonymous interviews in which they accused her of being a demanding, disrespectful and demeaning boss -- the kind who flings binders across the room in fits of pique.
To bolster their claims, they cited figures that suggest her employee turnover rate is among the highest in the Senate.
Some of these unnamed critics also said nice things, and several of Sen. Klobuchar's current staffers spoke in her defense. She later addressed the reports at a CNN town hall event. "You have to know that I love my staff," she said. "Am I a tough boss sometimes? Yes. Have I pushed people too hard? Yes. But I have kept expectations for myself that are very high. I've asked my staff to meet those same expectations."
Some people thought this unconventional line of criticism, rarely directed at male senators, reeked of sexism. Maybe so. For me, one of the strangest angles of the story came from another set of Congressional data nobody mentioned.
In a five-year period from 2014 to 2018, according to GovTrack.us, Sen. Klobuchar's allegedly browbeaten staff helped her co-sponsor 1,967 bills -- more than any other senator except Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal. Another study, conducted in 2016, ranked her No. 1 in the Senate in lending her name to bills that were enacted into law. Perhaps her former staffers wouldn't have become so disgruntled if they'd gotten more sleep.
Another factor that hasn't been thoroughly explored is something Sen. Klobuchar flicked at on CNN. Before winning her first election in 1998, she spent 14 years in the private sector managing teams at law firms. If she learned about leadership in a rough-and-tumble corporate performance culture, it's probably safe to assume that she runs her Senate shop a bit differently than a career politician.
Most young Senate staffers don't arrive on Capitol Hill with vast experience inside hard-driving businesses. In that context, I'm not sure a boss who once ripped her staff for giving her a salad to eat on a plane without a fork, as the New York Times reported, or remarked one day at the Capitol that she'd happily trade three of them for a bottle of water, would seem unusual enough to single out.
A spokeswoman for Sen. Klobuchar declined to comment.
In any event, these allegations should not be dismissed. The sheer number of anecdotes raises the possibility that there are even more to come. They're also timely: In the wake of the #MeToo movement, the business world has been agonizing over toxic workplaces and gargoyle bosses, and many executives have been subjected to harsh public reviews. Whether or not Sen. Klobuchar deserves this, one thing is certain: Too many bosses treat employees like dirt, and it's time we started thinning the herd.
This, of course, is easier said than done.
Before deciding where the future line should be drawn, it's worth exploring a nagging question. Are difficult bosses more likely to succeed, or inevitably doomed to fail?
There's no question that every so often a demanding, even belittling boss will possess enough raw leadership talent to achieve outsize results. Apple's Steve Jobs, who famously lit into employees, reducing some to tears, generated profits hand over fist. It's hard to argue that these unicorns should be discarded.
At the same time, it's often difficult to distinguish between a "tough" boss and an outright abusive one. The best yardstick, according to Stanford University professor Robert Sutton, author of "The No-Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't," is a leader's emotional impact on others. On that front, he says, research overwhelmingly suggests that bullied workers suffer greatly.
They're more likely to quit and call in sick, and to battle depression and anxiety. They're less liable to challenge the boss, point out errors, tell the truth, take risks or go the extra mile. "There might be some exceptions," Dr. Sutton says, "but you have to look at the weight of the evidence."
Another question is how often mistreated employees will themselves become abusive managers. There's plenty of evidence that churlish behavior is contagious, but a recent study on this topic in the Journal of Applied Psychology yielded a surprising result.
Sometimes, the authors found, workers respond to an abusive boss by resolving to do better. In fact, they'll go to great lengths to show subordinates that they're nothing like the ogre upstairs. By reframing their experience and trying to prevent it from infecting their own behavior, they become better leaders.
In other words, bad bosses often fail and inflict emotional damage along the way, but they're not always a virus that spreads.
The final question is whether there's any version of gladiatorial leadership that's worth tolerating.
Nearly all managers, at some point, "are going to have episodes that others perceive as bad behavior," Dr. Sutton says. Yelling at people all the time isn't good, but "there are times when a strategic temper tantrum works." If constructive conflict is the hallmark of any great team, then occasionally dressing someone down, especially if they're not accustomed to it, can have a strong motivating effect.
The problem with prosecuting individual cases of bad behavior is that it may force an overcorrection. If we criminalize toughness, Dr. Sutton says, people might start to view the most benign criticism as a personal attack.
There's some evidence that we're already headed down that road. Many companies are softening their approach to employees; offering perks, conducting frequent satisfaction surveys and focusing on "engagement." Some firms have tried to expunge the unbending "pay-your-dues" cultures of the past. As I wrote in November, some prominent companies have avoided chief executives with big personalities and sharp elbows in favor of unassuming, low-key managers in the mold of Mr. Rogers.
In my view, personality is overrated. Human beings are born with different temperaments: some burn hot, others run cool. But the instincts that make people extraordinary leaders are randomly distributed.
Sen. Klobuchar is clearly wired to be a demanding boss. It's also possible that the spotlight of the presidential campaign will reveal her to be a genuinely defective one. Either way, she's likely to lose some employees. Trust and loyalty are fragile, and a single ugly episode can shatter them forever.
The important question for voters to ponder is whether Sen. Klobuchar's management style is unacceptable, or whether it generally falls inside the range of what's tolerable for most people. If the former is true, she shouldn't be elected. If it's the latter, however, there's a strong argument for letting her be.
A time then when good leaders are hard to find is a terrible moment to toss out every candidate on the aggressive side of the spectrum.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The House Oversight Committee on Friday renewed its request to the White House for documents related to the administration's security-clearance processes, following reports that President Trump ordered his former chief of staff to grant his son-in-law a top-secret security clearance.
In a letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the panel's chairman, Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), said this was the committee's last request for voluntary compliance, suggesting he could seek to compel the administration's cooperation if the White House didn't turn over the documents.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Mr. Trump had overruled concerns expressed by intelligence officials and former White House counsel Don McGahn and ordered former chief of staff John Kelly to grant Jared Kushner—his son-in-law and a senior adviser—a top-secret clearance. Mr. Kelly wrote an internal memo about the episode at the time, the Times reported.
Mr. Trump has denied involvement in Mr. Kushner's or any other official's security-clearance process. When Mr. Kushner received a top-secret clearance in May, his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said that his client's application had been "properly submitted, reviewed by career officials, and went through the normal process." Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and Mr. Kushner's wife, said in an ABC News interview last month: "The president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband's clearance, zero."
The White House declined to comment on the report. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Lowell, said in a statement: "Whatever the accuracy or not of recent news stories, Mr. Lowell was not aware of nor told of any request for or action by the President to be involved in the security clearance process. Again, officials affirmed at the time that the regular process occurred without any pressure."
Mr. Cummings on Friday asked the White House if memos by Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGahn existed, Democrats serving on the committee said Friday on Twitter. "WH staff refused to confirm or deny—three times," they wrote.
Mr. Cummings, in his letter, wrote: "If true, these reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee."
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is tasked with conducting background checks on White House officials before they are granted permanent clearances. To begin that process, officials must submit a form called SF-86 that lists, among other matters, all of their foreign contacts within a certain time period. Mr. Kushner initially omitted any contacts with foreign individuals from the form, and later updated it at least three times to include what he has said were more than 100 contacts with foreigners from more than 20 countries
Mr. Kushner in February 2018 saw his interim clearance downgraded from Top Secret/SCI-level to Secret, an administration official said at the time. The move limited the amount of classified information that could be accessed by Mr. Kushner, who has played a central role in crafting White House policy toward China, Mexico, Canada and the Middle East. His permanent security clearance was restored three months later.

Report: Trump ordered clearance for Kushner
President Trump last year ordered officials to grant top-secret security clearance to his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, according to a report published Thursday by The New York Times.
Kushner was granted the high-level clearance last May after a lengthy background check.
The Times, citing anonymous sources, said Trump demanded Kushner's clearance despite the concerns of intelligence officials, then-Chief of Staff John Kelly and then-White House counsel Don McGahn.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
Kraft pleads not guilty to soliciting prostitutes
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has pleaded not guilty to two counts of misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution in a Florida case, according to court documents released Thursday.
Kraft's attorney Jack Goldberger filed the written plea with the Palm Beach County court on Wednesday. Kraft, 77, is requesting a non-jury trial.
Kraft was among hundreds of men charged in a crackdown on massage parlor prostitution and an investigation into human trafficking at Florida spas. Ten spas have been closed and several people, mostly women originally from China, have been charged with running the operation.
If Kraft is convicted, he would be required to complete 100 hours of community service and pay a $5,000 fine. He could also get jail time, but that is unlikely.
BETHESDA, Md.
Bush's service dog to help wounded vets
Sully, the service dog who symbolized devotion lying by former President George H.W. Bush's flag-draped casket, has a new mission.
The 2-year-old yellow Labrador retriever on Wednesday joined Walter Reed National Military Medical Center's dog program to help wounded veterans. Sully offered his paw as he was adminis tered an oath streamed on Facebook to "support, comfort and cheer warriors and their families."
The service dog was named for retired airline pilot Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger III, who became famous for landing a damaged passenger jet on the Hudson River in 2009.
Sully served Bush for six months until the former president died last November.

Texto completo: Flip open the covers on the half a dozen books listed here, and pretty soon you'll start hearing voices.
But that's O.K. when those voices are as provocative, thoughtful, funny and fascinating as are those in the six nonfiction titles that we've assembled in honor of Black History Month.
One voice belongs to a woman whose career in public service would seem at cross-purposes with that of her crime lord husband. One belongs to a man who nearly gave up hope when he was sentenced to life in prison as a teenager - and now is free and owns businesses that give ex-offenders a fresh start. And one voice belongs to a 19th-century white guy from Kentucky - John Marshall Harlan, the only U.S. Supreme Court justice to declare in a landmark court case that segregation by race was illegal.
All the titles below were written by local authors. Five have been published in the past month, and one comes out in April. And all will illuminate this particular corner of the world; five of the books are set in Maryland, while the sixth is a national story with profound local ramifications.
Here they are, in alphabetical order by title:
"Baltimore Civil Rights Leader Victorine Q. Adams: The Power of the Ballot," by Ida E. Jones
Victorine Q. Adams, the first African-American woman to serve on the Baltimore City Council, was a force so imposing that she couldn't be overshadowed by any man - not even by her husband, the Baltimore gambling kingpin, William "Little Willie" Adams.
When some suggested that she won the 1967 election solely because her wealthy husband financed her campaign, she wrote the following rebuttal, published on Dec. 25, 1971, in the Baltimore Afro-American: "I should be regarded not only as the wife of Willie Adams but as a woman who has used her influence and affluence to better the community in which she lives."
The author is the archivist for Morgan State University, which holds Victorine Adams' papers. Jones writes in the biography's preface that she sought to document all the various "lines" that her subject crossed - racial, gender and voter registration - in her remarkable 93-year life.
"Baltimore Civil Rights Leader Victorine Q. Adams: The Power of the Ballot" was published Jan. 21 by Arcadia Publishing and The History Press. 128 pages, $21.99.
"The Master Plan: My Journey from Life in Prison to a Life of Purpose," by Chris Wilson
Baltimorean Chris Wilson put together his "master plan" of all the things he intended to accomplish and the steps he'd have to take to get there at age 19 while he was serving a sentence of life in prison. But the 40-year-old Wilson no longer is behind bars. He was released in 2012 and subsequently founded the Barclay Investment Group, which seeks to employ former felons.
Wilson's story began with a childhood characterized by hunger, neglect and physical abuse. His story is so unusual that it earned him two invitations to the White House and has been featured by such publications as Forbes, Fortune and The Baltimore Sun. "It really feels good to help people to earn an honest living," Wilson wrote for The Sun in 2015. "I can't help but to wonder where I would be if so many people hadn't put their faith in me and helped me be a better person."
"The Master Plan: My Journey from Life in Prison to a Life of Purpose" was released Feb. 5 by G.P. Putnam's Sons. 432 pages, $27.
"Plantations, Slavery & Freedom on Maryland's Eastern Shore," by Jacqueline Hedberg
Jacqueline Hedberg is a retired history teacher whose family has lived in Dorchester County for 350 years. When she read a 2015 article about a shameful episode in her birthplace's past of which she was unaware - the forced migration of enslaved people from Maryland to such Southern states as Louisiana and Mississippi - she was shaken.
"Why didn't I know that story?" she wrote in the book's preface. "Why didn't I know about coffles - those trains of slaves, chained together, forced to walk more than one thousand miles from the Chesapeake to the slave markets of the South?"
For the next few years, Hedberg pored over wills, deeds, bills of sale and other public records. She read roughly 100 books, journals and other documents, seeking to learn all about the slave trade on Maryland's Eastern Shore. She taught what she found to the students in her adult education classes at Towson University, and then condensed it into this book.
"Plantations, Slavery & Freedom on Maryland's Eastern Shore" was published Jan. 21 by Arcadia Publishing and The History Press. 160 pages, $21.99.
"Separate: The Story of Plessy V. Ferguson, and America's Journey from Slavery to Segregation," by Steve Luxenberg
The second published book by Baltimore author Steve Luxenberg has only been out for a few days and it's already generating buzz. This deeply researched story of the people involved in what is widely considered to be among the worst Supreme Court rulings of all time received a long and mostly laudatory review from The New Yorker and was named by The New York Times as one of 12 new books to watch for in February. Luxenberg also participated in NPR's "On Point" on Feb. 8 in an hourlong discussion of race relations in the U.S.
Many books have been published previously about the Plessy v. Ferguson case, which permitted "separate but equal" treatment based on race. Luxenberg, a former editor for The Baltimore Sun, decided instead to focus on three of the main players and to explore their contradictions: Albion Tourgee, a white civil rights advocate, designed the legal strategy for Plessy. A New Englander, associate justice Henry Billings Brown, wrote the majority opinion that declared segregation to be legal. The sole dissent was written by a Southerner, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan.
"Separate: The Story of Plessy V. Ferguson, and America's Journey from Slavery to Segregation," was published Feb. 12 by W. W. Norton & Company. 624 pages, $35.
"Uncle Tom's Journey from Maryland to Canada: The Life of Josiah Henson," by Edna M. Troiano
The image of an "Uncle Tom" that exists now in popular culture - of a servile black man - couldn't be further from the truth about the real-life human being behind the stereotype.
Josiah Henson was born into slavery in 1789 in Charles County. As an adult, he escaped to Canada with his wife and children, established a settlement for fugitives and repeatedly returned to the U.S. to lead others to freedom along the Underground Railroad. Henson published a bestselling autobiography and became an acclaimed preacher and lecturer, as well as the inspiration for the title character in Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
In recent years, several books have resurrected the story of this once-forgotten man. Troiano writes in the book's preface that she set out to explore how Henson disappeared from history and why his name isn't typically mentioned alongside those of more celebrated Maryland abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.
"Uncle Tom's Journey from Maryland to Canada: The Life of Josiah Henson" was published Jan. 21 by Arcadia Publishing and The History Press. 179 pages, $21.99.
"We Speak for Ourselves: A Word from Forgotten Black America," by D. Watkins
Baltimore's D. Watkins is the kind of guy who during a five-minute conversation will bring up 15 unrelated big ideas, nearly all of them interesting. His third book, an essay collection, is chock full of the author's blunt opinions about how to engage in productive conversations about race in America.
Watkins is the self-admitted former drug dealer turned author and college professor who became nationally known in 2014 after his essay about life in East Baltimore, "Too Poor for Pop Culture," went viral.
You'll have to wait to read his new book - "We Speak for Ourselves" won't be published for a few months - but the essay titles and chapter headings seem to indicate that success hasn't mellowed Watkins. A few samples: "Intellectually Curious or Racist?" "The Sad Truth is Black Lives Really Don't Matter" and "Did You Know There are Different Types of Black People?"

Texto completo: One of the many memorable things Willie Nelson has written is that it's funny how time slips away. Willie didn't mean funny ha-ha. He meant funny odd. And in our hyperpoliticized time what's funny is how liberal outrage slips away.
It was only yesterday that Virginia's three highest officials were on their way out for capital crimes against the racial and sexual dogmas of modern liberalism—Gov. Ralph Northam for the blackfaced and hooded Klan figures in his medical-school yearbook, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax for two sexual-assault allegations and Attorney General Mark Herring, who outed himself for a blackface transgression nearly 40 years ago.
Here is how the New York Times teed up Mr. Northam the day of the yearbook revelation: "He faced intense pressure on Friday night to step down, as Democrats moved swiftly to send a zero-tolerance message."
Swiftly? The Democratic Party's presidential candidates nearly killed each other in a stampede to repudiate Gov. Northam: Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Julián Castro said he had to go. So did Mr. Northam's predecessor as governor, Terry McAuliffe, who has pretenses to a presidential run in the Democrats' not-too-visible "moderate" lane. So did most of the state's Democratic congressional delegation and various other party celebrities.
Then on cue came more liberal outrage after the accusations against Mr. Fairfax, who is black, and again after Mr. Herring's confession. For a while it looked as if the Democrats would have to perform identity-politics triage to stop the state's No. 4 official, Republican House Speaker Kirk Cox, from floating into the governorship.
The most legally serious charges were against Mr. Fairfax. But if the Democrats threw a black man over the side for sexual abuse, they couldn't protect two white guys for racial violations. Sex and race have separate progressive constituencies, so the Democrats would have to appease both camps.
The logical fall guy was Gov. Northam. His yearbook offense was a twofer: the blackface figure and, worse, someone in a Klan hood. (He admitted then denied he was one of the pictured young men.) That would have let Mr. Herring, the least bad abuser, keep the party's hold on the statehouse.
Say goodbye to all that. The outrage has receded to a trickle. The three men remain in office, and the chances any will leave are about zero.
You have to hand it to someone—Mr. Northam or the identity-politics crisis team he hired (naturally it has spawned an industry)—who figured out that the smart play was to gut it out, albeit with a now-mandatory display of groveling and apologies.
Hypocrisy? Of course, and on a grand scale. A double standard? Who can doubt it? If this were happening to the top three Texas Republicans—Greg Abbott, Dan Patrick and Ken Paxton—the national media wouldn't have let up for a day until they quit.
But maybe there is a third way to view what has become of these Virginia episodes. Why not call it a return to sanity about what should qualify as cause to obliterate an individual's career?
Let it be noted that Lt. Gov. Fairfax has demanded a legal investigation into the two women's complaints against him, and presumably something like that will be undertaken.
Opinion Live Event
Join us on March 4 as WSJ Opinion's Paul Gigot leads a "State of TV News" panel discussion including Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo, CBS's Christy Tanner and "Network" actor Tony Goldwyn. Included in your admission to the event is a ticket to see "Network" on Broadway at a subsequent date.
Viewed rationally, the refusal of the Virginia officials to quit should force the left's off-with-their-heads ideologues to come up with an approach more in keeping with the traditional legal and cultural norms of American life—such as due process, temporary suspension, rehabilitation and forgiveness.
As it stands, the identity-obsessed left is importing into U.S. politics the techniques of the French Revolution—a routine march of their enemies to the guillotine. Exhibit A remains the destruction of due process in the Brett Kavanaugh nomination.
Virginia, like the retribution against many offending liberal professors on campuses, makes clear that the identity brigades are indiscriminate. Which explains the obeisances paid them by the Democratic presidential contenders, most notably Ms. Harris, who is becoming the Automatic Agreer on such issues. Ask Justin Fairfax.
Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, head of the Democratic Governors Association, said Saturday, "At this point, it's up to the people of Virginia." It was an attempt to get the guvs off the hook, but her point about Virginia's voters is a good one.
Opinion polls say a plurality of Virginians don't want the three men to resign. Quinnipiac's poll interestingly found 56% of black voters saying Gov. Northam should stay.
What this suggests is that the identity-politics left—for all the media play it gets and despite its intimidation of national Democrats—is operating in an alternative universe from many voters.
It never made sense that most Americans would share the left's taste for purification rituals or its compulsion to annihilate offenders of its identity orthodoxies, not least by overturning elections.
If Ralph Northam deserves a reprieve, and he does, then so do others, including Republicans and conservatives. Fat chance.

Tax Lawyer Confirmed
As IRS Chief Counsel
The Senate confirmed Michael Desmond as chief counsel of the IRS, filling an administration vacancy that had lasted for more than two years.
Mr. Desmond, a California tax lawyer and former Treasury official, will hold one of two presidentially appointed positions at the Internal Revenue Service. He will oversee the lawyers who write regulations, provide internal legal advice during audits and defend the agency in litigation.
The Senate confirmed Mr. Desmond on an 83-15 vote.
No Republicans voted against the nomination. The no votes included presidential candidates Cory Booker (D., N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.).
President Trump nominated Mr. Desmond in March 2018 and then renominated him this year after the previous Congress adjourned without voting on his nomination.

FEDERAL RESERVE
Powell Says Runoff
Set to End This Year
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank is close to announcing plans for ending the runoff of its $4 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets this year.
"We're going to be in a position . . . to stop runoff later this year," Mr. Powell told members of the House Financial Services Committee.
Mr. Powell said Fed officials are near agreement on a plan. "My guess is we'll be announcing something fairly soon," he said. The Fed's rate-setting committee next meets on March 19-20.
Officials began shrinking their crisis-era holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities in 2017 and they plan to continue reducing their mortgage-bond holdings after the runoff ends, leaving primarily Treasurys.

D.C. ATTORNEY GENERAL
Inaugural Committee
Receives a Subpoena
The District of Columbia attorney general's office has subpoenaed President Trump's inaugural committee for documents related to an investigation into whether the fund's spending was "wasteful, mismanaged" or "improperly provided private benefit."
The subpoena, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, is the third such request to the committee, which is also the subject of investigations by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the New Jersey attorney general.
"The Presidential Inauguration Committee is in receipt of the subpoena issued by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, and is in contact with staff regarding this inquiry," a spokesman for the committee said.
The subpoena was first reported by the New York Times.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine's subpoena appears more narrowly focused than the other two subpoenas the committee has received, signaling an interest by investigators into dealings between the inaugural committee and Mr. Trump's family business.

CFPB
Financial Abuse
Of Elderly Increases
Financial institutions are reporting an increasing number of suspicious activities involving financial abuse targeting older adults, according to a new government analysis.
Financial companies in 2017 filed 63,500 reports with the Treasury Department of suspected cases of financial exploitation of older adults -- though the age range is undefined -- up 19% from a year earlier, and nearly three times the level reported in 2014, according to a report released Wednesday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The financial damage related to suspected activities in 2017 totaled $1.7 billion, the CFPB report said. And when a monetary loss occurred, seniors lost $34,200 on average: In 7% of the cases, the losses exceeded $100,000.

Playing Cat and Mouse With a Surveillance State

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Paul Mozur, a technology correspondent based in Shanghai, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your most important tech tools for reporting in Shanghai, especially with a government known for surveillance?
In China, evading the watchful eyes of the government sometimes feels like an exercise in futility. The place is wired with about 200 million surveillance cameras, Beijing controls the telecom companies, and every internet company has to hand over data when the police want it. They also know where journalists live because we register our address with police. In Shanghai, the police regularly come to my apartment; once they demanded to come inside.
That said, China is big, and the government less than competent. Sometimes the police who come to my door have no idea I'm a journalist. Usually the higher-ups who deal with my visa don't know about the house visits. The lack of coordination means one of the best things to do is to try to slip through the cracks. Basically, protect yourself but also leave an innocent trace.
I use an iPhone because Apple tends to be more secure than Android. That's especially true in China, where the blocks against Google mean there are a huge number of third-party Android stores peddling all kinds of sketchy apps.
It's also important to realize that because Beijing controls the telecoms, your domestic phone number can be a liability. For secure apps like Signal, I toggle the registration lock so that if they try to mirror my phone, my account still has a layer of protection.
To get around the Great Firewall, I use a few different VPNs, which I won't name because when we do bring them up they usually get new government attention.
In some parts of China, the police will demand to check your phone, usually to delete photos. Having two phones helps with this -- to make it even trickier, I have the same case on both phones. But it's also good to have other ways to protect your data. I use a few apps that disguise themselves as something innocuous but in fact hide and protect data. It's also always handy to have a USB drive that can plug into your phone and be used to save stuff quickly.
What do you do to keep sources secure?
As my colleague Li Yuan noted, WeChat is a reporter's best friend in China. Everyone spends huge amounts of time on it. But WeChat is also closely monitored, so when a sensitive topic comes up, I try to guide people to use more secure apps.
That can also be a problem, though, because setting up an encrypted messaging app can alert the authorities to the person. In light of that, personal meetings also work. Often that means leaving the phone at home, since a device's microphone can become a listening device. There are also special Faraday bags, which block communications signals and can help you go dark with your phone on you. Sometimes all the surveillance here makes me want to put one on my head.
In some cases, it's not possible to get around the government, and you have to make a judgment call about whether the source understands the risks and how severe the punishment might be. Sometimes we go places and it's not possible to safely interview people, so we don't. The government frequently wins.
What is the oddest surveillance tech you've seen in China?
China is a gadget-loving nation. Often technology that doesn't totally work is embraced with alacrity. I think my favorite example was the facial-recognition sunglasses that made the rounds last year. The police were rocking these glasses, with a camera that plugged into a smartphone-like minicomputer. The idea was the glasses could identify people as the police looked at them. When I got to try them on, I found out they didn't work all that well.
In some ways, that doesn't matter. If you convince people you know everything about them, they're less likely to break rules. The police officer told me about how they had used the glasses to intimidate a drug smuggler into a full confession. It shows you that tech doesn't always have to function in order to work.
I actually was talking about that with my editor the other day. When he calls from Hong Kong, there's a pause of several seconds before the phone connects. It could be the government listening in, or maybe it's just a slow network. We can't be sure, but we sure are paranoid, and we often joke about it.
What kind of protections do you take when you travel in China?
The Chinese police are famous for showing up in hotel rooms. They don't always do it, but it happens enough that when you're in China, you shouldn't leave your devices in your room unattended. In 2009, when I returned to my room while reporting out of the western region of Xinjiang, I found a police officer reclining on the bed, smoking a cigarette and casually swiping through the photos on my digital camera.
To avoid lugging a laptop everywhere I go, I now just travel with two phones and a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard I can use to quickly write up notes or articles directly on the phone. It's not entirely secure, since there are devices that intercept Bluetooth communications, so for passwords I type directly on the phone.
Other than that, I figure that if the Chinese authorities want to intercept my Bluetooth keyboard signal, they'll just get an appreciation of how little work my editors have to do to my sterling copy.
It should also be said that for all these precautions, there's no doubt the authorities have plenty of ways into our communications. It's almost impossible to stop a determined state actor, but it's worth making it more difficult.
How do people in China view the privacy awakening in the United States after the Cambridge Analytica scandal and other data snafus?
The privacy situation is dreadful in China. Personal data of all stripes leaks from companies and government alike. While there's an assumption of some level of monitoring, many Chinese are as appalled as Americans when it affects them.
Amusingly, even the government doesn't trust the government. In reporting on data sharing between different ministries, I've found that it's not uncommon for one part of the government to distrust another to the point it won't share data. At other times, a government branch might not even trust itself to handle data.
For a country trying to become a superpower of artificial intelligence, big data, cyberspace, innovation and whatever buzzword dominates tech next, it's a pretty big problem.
Then again, when it comes to poor privacy protection, the United States seems to be doing its best to take on China.
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.

Texto completo: Others have noticed what a foolish thing the Utah Legislature did in rolling back the Medicaid expansion that was approved by the voters in November.
— Stupid Medicaid tricks: Utah figures out how to spend more to cover fewer people — Michael Hiltzik | The Los Angeles Times
"It has become obvious over the past few years that the Affordable Care Act has the power to cloud Republicans’ minds.
But few are as befuddled as the legislature and governor of Utah, who just enacted a partial expansion of Medicaid under the ACA that will cover 60,000 fewer residents while costing the state more than full expansion. ...
" ... What’s more, the measure represents flagrant defiance of the people’s will. At the November polls, Utahans approved a full expansion of Medicaid by a solid 53%-47% vote.
“ ‘I do not accept the characterization that SB 96 ignores the will of the people,’ Gov. Gary Herbert said of the bill that superseded the November initiative. ‘I see this as a thoughtful effort to implement the will of the people.’
“Sure it is. ...”
— Utah Against Health Insurance: The state’s politicians have rejected the will of the voters and taken coverage from 60,000 Utahns. — David Leonhardt | The New York Times
"In November, the people of Utah voted to provide health insurance for about 150,000 state residents who lacked it. Last week, Utah’s legislators overruled their own constituents and took away insurance from about 60,000 of those 150,000 people.
The legislators claimed they were trying to save money, but that’s not a credible rationale: The federal government would have covered the bulk of the cost . The true reason — which the legislators weren’t willing to admit publicly — was a philosophical objection to government-provided health insurance. ...
" ... The offending politicians have been mostly Republican, as they are in Utah. ‘You see a rising, disturbing trend here of equivocation, if not worse, in the commitment to democratic norms on the part of a growing number of Republicans,’ Larry Diamond, a Stanford University democracy expert, told my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick. ‘Is this what the Republican Party wants to be? The anti-democracy party?’ ..."
— Utah voters chose Medicaid expansion. Republican politicians decided they knew better. — Chris Cillizza | CNN
"The Utah legislature passed a measure that would restrict the state’s ability to accept Medicaid expansion money from the federal government under the Affordable Care Act -- a move that essentially undid a ballot initiative -- Proposition 3 -- approved by voters last November.
“Which is a very weird thing for politicians, who depend on channeling the public will, to do. In search of some explanation for this bizarre behavior, I reached out the the Salt Lake Tribune’s Benjamin Wood , who has been all over this Medicaid expansion fight. ...”
— Our Utah representatives are not representing us — Madison Nagel | For The Tribune
" ... But despite the clear wants of the majority, our Legislature is working hard to tear down the initiatives that voters passed in November. Why have we seen such backlash on both initiatives from our own representatives, even in spite of evident public support? The term “representative” implies that Utah’s Legislature should do just that: represent their voter base. And although the legislators’ constituents have made their feelings on both propositions known, Utah’s Legislature seems hellbent on reducing both initiatives to a mere fraction of what voters demonstrated they support. ..."
— The GOP Keeps Changing The Rules After It Loses Elections — Jeffrey Young | Huffpost
“Last Election Day , 555,651 Utahns ― 53 percent of voters ― backed a measure to expand Medicaid to low-income adults in the state. Last Monday, 79 Republicans made it clear they don’t care what those voters wanted. ...
" ... Americans often complain that it feels like their votes don’t matter. Taken together, this pattern of conduct by Republicans sends an overt message to these voters that they’re right."
— Pass. Repeal. Repeat: The GOP Cycle of Defying Voters on Medicaid Expansion — Mattie Quinn | Governing magazine
" ... While some Republicans in Georgia, Oklahoma and Wyoming are exploring the possibility of Medicaid expansion in their states, Idaho and Utah are undoing ballot measures that voters passed in November to expand Medicaid. ..."
— A Utahan Who Needs Chemotherapy on What Happens If Her State Rejects Medicaid Expansion Again — Amanda Schaffer | The New Yorker
" ... I am anguished at the thought of the expansion being repealed. I can’t believe that lawmakers would completely ignore what the voters said they wanted. That’s the point of our government. That’s the point of voting! It’s a Republican trait to want to save money, but we have a surplus this year. There have been marches, there have been protests, there have been petitions — I don’t know what it would take to convince legislators. They’re looking at how much it will cost instead of seeing that there are people they can save. I’m one of those people.”

Never mind 'Green Book.' Listen to Don Shirley.

Texto completo: Let's look on the bright side of "Green Book." It has revived Don Shirley's music.
Like a lot of people, I wasn't crazy about the movie, a buddy pic with a racial twist and a smiley face. In it, a white, racist nightclub bouncer from the American North is hired to drive a black classical pianist through the American South on a 1962 performance tour, using the guidebook that let black motorists know where they were allowed to eat and stay.
Along the movie's scenic highways and byways, the two men bond. The tough-talking white chauffeur helps the effete black musician mellow out, protects him from bad white guys and in the process sheds his own bigotry.
When the two motor back to New York City -- spoiler alert -- the chauffeur's previously racist relatives greet the previously unwelcome black man with open arms.
Abracadabra and kumbaya.
On Sunday night, this cartoonish version of race and friendship won the Oscar for Best Picture, provoking a collective howl from people who hated it. I didn't quite hate it, and I know people, a couple of them black, who liked it a lot. It's visually pleasing, well-acted and its vision of an America in which we all learn to get along is no doubt well-intentioned.
But such a complex topic isn't served by such a simplistic telling, and the cheery, caricatured "Green Book" version of our history seems off-key in 2019.
Forget all that for a moment. Let's focus on the music.
Shirley's music has been largely left out of the "Green Book" discussion, which is a shame. Reintroducing the music may be the movie's greatest achievement.
Like most people, I didn't know Shirley's playing until recently, but having found it, I'm mesmerized. I heard it first on the radio, before I'd seen the movie. I was driving when I tuned in mid-song to some piano playing that felt slightly different from anything I'd ever heard. It was so riveting I slowed down to listen.
The station played a couple more songs in the same style -- rhythmic and melodic, upbeat yet meditative -- before the announcer named the player: Don Shirley.
I went home and found more, and in a column a couple of weeks ago, I briefly recommended the album "Don Shirley's Best." I've been hearing from readers ever since.
"Wow," wrote one, "thank you for the introduction to Don Shirley and his music! I enjoy music, but certainly not an aficionado, so had never heard of this artist. Interestingly, an acquaintance saw the movie 'Green Book' and loved it, but never mentioned Don Shirley."
Another wrote to say that he'd been inspired to turn off the Sunday political TV talk shows and listen to Don Shirley instead.
"I think the calming music and avoidance of politicians is just what the doctor ordered," he wrote.
When Shirley died in 2013, his New York Times obituary said he "invented what amounted to his own musical genre."
Classical, jazz, pop, show tunes, spirituals. They all find a home in his playing. Some of it might be called "easy listening," though it's not tepid listening.
I'm particularly fond of his versions of "Stand By Me" and "If I Had a Hammer." I've listened to "Water Boy," probably his most popular song, hundreds of times, and every time my blood pressure drops.
In a recent L.A. Times piece, the musician Anthony Weller, a friend of Shirley's, said "he was so relentlessly inward-looking that he found depth everywhere."
Weller also said that race was never far from Shirley's mind. He quoted from one of Shirley's record jackets:
"It is only in his music, which Americans are able to admire because a protective sentimentality limits their understanding of it, that the Negro in America has been able to tell his story."
Don Shirley's story has many elements. "Green Book" reopened that story to the world, even if its telling was incomplete.
Over the weekend, I saw a friend who needed cheering up so I recommended she find Shirley on Amazon Prime. She texted me a while later:
"Having a Don Shirley fest today! What a pleasure!"
No matter what its failures, "Green Book" gets credit for alerting so many of us to that pleasure.

The Media Will Re-Elect Trump

Texto completo: Donald Trump's tenure has been a pleasant surprise compared to expectations, which isn't saying much. His administration has been as chaotic as predicted, driven by his habit of saying unscripted things. But it also has been productive of a few things: corporate tax reform, curbing regulation, injecting a semi-useful ferment into our foreign policy.
The remainder of his term was always likely to be dominated by the enormous baggage he brought with him -- his business and personal history.
What was not foreseeable is the extent to which the FBI's meddling in the 2016 presidential race, using Russia's meddling as an excuse, would become a counter thread in the narrative of alleged Trump corruption.
There is a humongous irony here. Not expecting to win, Mr. Trump allowed his organization's desultory pursuit of a Trump tower in Moscow to continue during the 2016 campaign. Make no mistake, though a report that he instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about this matter has been debunked by none other than special counsel Robert Mueller, it remains true that Mr. Cohen lied to Congress. The lack of any other crime will not stop this episode from being central in a Democratic House impeachment hearing resting heavily on hints that there is something fishy about Mr. Trump's attitudes about Russia.
But what is true of Mr. Trump is also true of James Comey. He also expected Mr. Trump to lose. The FBI's own highly questionable actions during the campaign, which inadvertently helped elect Mr. Trump, he and his Obama colleagues also expected to go unexamined.
Thus we find ourselves in a place where the Mueller report will settle nothing. It can't prove a negative, so the hunt by Democrats and the media for collusion will go on. Read any liberal pundit: Collusion now means if Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin both wanted Mr. Trump to be president, Mr. Trump is guilty. (Never mind that this stance essentially gives Mr. Putin's trolls and hackers a veto over who can be president.)
Under Democratic leadership, the House Intelligence Committee is well on its way to becoming a Warren Commission for an alternative universe in which JFK spent a nice day in Dallas. Rep. Adam Schiff has signaled that he intends to rake through Mr. Trump's business and bank records searching for the motive for collusion crimes that exist only in his imagination.
All this will be cheered on by backward-rationalizing pundits in the New York Times, justifying their own hysteria by portraying the routine, predictable and typically opportunistic partisan opposition faced by Mr. Trump as somehow exceptionally heroic.
A more honest rendition would notice that Mr. Trump -- in many ways an accidental president -- is also an unusually inexperienced and weak president, lacking even meaningful institutional roots in his own party.
It takes no heroism to oppose him. His statements are easily mocked for not conforming to the expected hypocrisies. He supplies his enemies more extracurricular targets than Bill Clinton did. He is universally reviled by elite institutions, including the media. Except for his knack for turning their hatred into lemonade, his only asset is his rapport with an unrich, unconnected voter segment that falls far short of a majority.
Indeed, it is hard to explain how Mr. Trump can simultaneously be such a menace and such a pushover that every Democratic officeholder in the country thinks, "If only I can stumble into the nomination, I'm sure to be the next president."
The answer, of course, is pundit vanity: Mr. Trump is a threat to democracy because writers opposing him then are very important people.
Our wonderful English language gives us a perfectly good word for major media interpretations of the Trump phenomenon. That word is fatuous. When historians weigh his well-advertised nature vs. the fantastic overreaction to his election, their first question will be: How did he become president? Voters must have had something in mind when they pulled the lever for somebody so seemingly unsuitable.
But even deeper into the night they will wonder: How did so rich and complex a society as ours survive a pundit class so devoid of judgment, so incapable even of identifying what was interesting about the times they live in?
So here we are. The media will eventually take notice of the strange acts of the U.S. intelligence community and their role in the 2016 election. Either that, or the story of the decade will continue to be told by alternative media outlets that, for all their faults, at least provide a venue for ignored realities to be taken account of.
In the meantime, imagine you're one of the millions who thinks four years of the Trump show is probably enough. You can only marvel at the obliviousness with which his enemies are working to assure (and even necessitate) his re-election.

Why is Obama allowed ‘executive discretion’ on immigration, but Trump isn't?

Texto completo: As House Democrats vote Tuesday to stop President Trump’s emergency declaration on the southern border, congressional Republicans should ask themselves: Why is it that every other president is permitted by courts to exercise “executive discretion,” and yet Trump isn’t?

A New York Times report on Monday set up the scene for weak-willed Senate Republicans, writing that, “The [Democrat-controlled] House’s vote on a declaration of disapproval will force Republicans to choose between the congressional prerogative over federal spending established in the Constitution and a president determined to go around the legislative branch to secure funds for a border wall that Congress has refused to grant.”

This is, on its face, a false choice, though some in the GOP are stupidly buying into it.

Trump’s emergency declaration earlier this month does nothing more than free up little bits of money already allocated to the executive branch so that he can build more wall barriers on the border, stunting the overwhelming flood of illegal immigration from Latin America.

It’s every bit of a crisis today as it was when former President Barack Obama called it that in 2014, and the media happily played along. Trump’s official declaration only means he’s using his last option to address the issue.

This isn’t an choice between fidelity to the Constitution or blind loyalty to a president; though I’ll note the executive branch is part of that newly appreciated document, and Congress has already given the president the authority to do exactly what Trump is pursuing. This is a choice about relinquishing authority to Democrats to set immigration policy even while a Republican president is in office.

Obama made up his own law in 2012 that said nearly 1 million eligible illegal immigrants in the U.S. would not only be overlooked by law enforcement but could come out, declare themselves to the public, and receive indefinite legal protection.

Take for granted that the program was created out of compassion — plus Obama’s upcoming re-election — for young immigrants who may only know the U.S. as their home, but it should then also be taken for granted that if one president can dictate immigration policy within the authority Congress has given them, the same right belongs to every other president. Or, at the very least, every other president should be able to exercise power in moving to limit the influx of foreigners by erecting limited structures on the border.

Not so fast, says the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit!

The federal court ruled in November that the Trump administration could not end the Obama-era program with the argument that it was never legal to set it up in the first place. And yet, in the court’s unanimous opinion, it repeatedly acknowledged that the executive branch has the right to determine enforcement of immigration law by way of “executive discretion.”

Page 10: Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals “was a permissible exercise of executive discretion.”

Page 27: The Reagan administration “exercised executive discretion to defer the deportation of the minor children of non-citizens” and “extended voluntary departure, the mechanism through which these individuals were allowed to remain in the United States is, like deferred action, a creature of executive discretion.”

Page 69: “We therefore conclude that DACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion.”

Who with a straight face could argue that it’s acceptable “executive discretion” for one president to carve out an exception for up to 1 million people not legally entitled residence in the U.S. but that it’s unconstitutional for another duly elected executive to eliminate that same exception? The 9th Circuit did it.

Now Trump’s emergency declaration is, as everyone knew it would be, tangled up in court. That order didn’t even affect anyone in the U.S., whether legally here or not. It did nothing more than cobble together funds available to the executive so that Trump might add on to the existing walls and barriers at the southern border, slowing down the drug dealers, human traffickers, and child molesters from Central America.

Skittish Republicans can keep this in mind when presented with the fake dilemma that they must either choose between the Constitution and the president. They can instead choose reality.

Lettuce funk at the Stanley Concert Hall







This past weekend Stanley Live and AEG Presents hosted the funk band Lettuce, who are on the 2 nd leg of their Vibe Up Tour.  To get an idea of their popularity consider that they have been touring for two decades and playing shows with as many as 20,000 guests - like at last year's Summer Camp Festival in Chillicothe, Il.
The Stanley Hotel, on the other hand, offers one of the most intimate concert settings in the nation. Their concert hall only holds a few hundred people. And after the show the band typically performs in The Whiskey Bar at The Cascades Restaurant, which is a great opportunity to get a photograph with members of the band.
Lettuce is a fusion of six talented musicians: drummer Adam Deitch, guitarist Adam “Shmeans” Smirnoff, bassist Erick “Jesus” Coomes, keyboardist and vocalist Nigel Hall, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet player Eric Bloom. Their music is a fusion of smooth jazz and up-beat jives – aka Funk.
As Arleigh Carl, 58 from Fort Collins said, “It's like a jazz rave!”
She was riding the rail Friday night and said that she was checking out Lettuce so she could take her 80 year-old father to Lettuce's Rage Rocks, Red Rocks show on June 15 th .
           All kinds of people can be found at these Stanley Hotel shows.
Jesse Fenner, 36 from Wheatridge, said, “Lettuce brings the people together like they blend the music.”
It is easy to agree with that statement, however, the blend of people is just as attributable to the venue as the band. At The Stanley Hotel there can be gentleman getting groovy in suits and ties, next to dreadlocked dudes without shoes on.
Fenner, quoted above, is a father of a little girl, and was on a date night with his wife. James Frie, 29 from Golden, is a chemist who makes CBD and THC distillate. Douglas Jones, 31 from Arvada, was there to support his friends in the band, he is a professional snowboarder for Smokin Snowboards.
The crowd clearly loved Lettuce, from start to finish the dance floor stayed full. This was surprising because Lettuce was rocking the place hard. Playing classics like “Sounds Like a Party to Me” and “Trillogy,” watch our recap video for more!
The Stanley Hotel has a reputation for paranormal activity. It is always interesting to see if the musicians find inspiration in that environment.
Nigel Hall said, “It's not as freaky as people make it out to be.”
Even so, for some in the crowd, the electric-feel of Hall's keyboard and the slow march beat of Zoidis' saxophone was like an invitation for a disturbance. Perhaps all the opening acts by Ghost Note during this Vibe Up Tour rubbed off on them.
Lettuce slowed it down for “Keep that Same Old Feeling” and relative to the original by The Crusaders it maintained slick bass lines by Coomes and smooth trumpeting by Bloom.
After the show Bloom said, “Show up to every moment like you're meant to be there.”
Let us remember that.           
Lettuce band members have an extensive pedigree outside of the band. Adam Deitch is a member of Break Science and has played with John Scofield, 50 Cent, Talib Kweli, and Wyclef Jean. Erick Coomes is also a producer who has worked with Kanye West and Dr. Dre and has toured as the bassist for Britney Spears and The Game.
Lettuce has garnered praise by the likes of New York Times, NPR, Billboard, Consequence of Sound, Relix, Red Bull Music and more. It is a treat to get such talent in the most intimate venue around.
Finishing the show with a Redrum Punch at the Whiskey Bar, while recapping with friends or dancing to the after-party entertainment is the cherry on top. After both Friday and Saturday's three-hour sets the band stayed for another 2 hours at the bar, playing music till the early hours of the morning.
Thanks for funking it up!

Texto completo: The rise of social media characters dedicated to plying the malleable fringe of the electorate with dubious claims and disinformation has paced the onus on the news media and reputable sources to combat their efforts.
The left needs to take accountability, too
By CJ Pearson
We live in a time in which there is a war on truth. We live in a time in which the "truth" most comforting is the truth most acceptable. We live in a time in which the truth — most unfortunately — is discardable.
In January, the students of Covington Catholic High School traveled to our nation's capital unknowing of the debacle that would follow. In short order, their lives would be upended by a social media mob with no regard or concern for the truth.
Innocent teenage boys — whom I have since come to know quite well — would soon be labeled racists and bigots. They would be accused of disrespect and incivility. They would face death threats and doxxing. All due to one video clip, taken severely out of context, which took the internet by storm.

I watched firsthand as my friends at Covington Catholic were crucified and marred by nameless online trolls whom they had never met. I watched firsthand as my friends at Covington had death wished upon them. I looked on as grown men and women — with little to any evidence — denigrated, defamed and slandered children. And I looked on as new evidence came to light that exonerated my friends but was ignored by some of the same left-wing actors that had sought to ruin their lives.
Evidence was ignored for one reason: to keep alive the baseless and salacious narrative that had been perpetuated. The narrative that all supporters of President Donald Trump — young and old — are racist and bigoted.
This is not the only instance in which those on the left have disregarded the truth in an effort to proliferate a lie.
Last week, actor Jussie Smollett was charged with doing just that: filing a false police report in connection to a hate crime that allegedly never even happened. Smollett alleged that while walking the streets of Chicago, he was attacked by two white men wearing Make America Great Again hats. He also claimed to have been verbally accosted with a barrage of homophobic and racial slurs. And that he was left bruised and badly beaten on a sidewalk near a Subway restaurant.
However, this is now in question. According to the Chicago Police Department, Smollett staged this attack, paying two actors $3,500 to carry it out. He allegedly did so because he was dissatisfied with his salary of as much as $125,000 per episode.
If he concocted this hoax, Smollett has defamed Trump's millions of supporters and did so unashamedly. If this is a hoax, Smollett did nothing more than confirm the prejudices held by those on the left toward those on the right.
Apparently, he not only sought to plant seeds of division, he also sought to profit from them — truth be damned.

What others are saying
Gordon Pennycook and David Rand, The New York Times: "Reasoning can exacerbate the problem, not provide the solution, when it comes to partisan disputes over facts. Further evidence cited in support of this of argument comes from a 2010 study by the political scientists Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler, who found that appending corrections to misleading claims in news articles can sometimes backfire: Not only did corrections fail to reduce misperceptions, but they also sometimes increased them. It seemed as if people who were ideologically inclined to believe a given falsehood worked so hard to come up with reasons that the correction was wrong that they came to believe the falsehood even more strongly. "
Brett Bruen, CNN. com: "In many ways, information warfare is harder to detect than nuclear, chemical, or biological agents. Like a mythical creature, it is able to constantly change forms. Not having a group standing watch together creates gaps, delays and difficulty in developing a high-performing team. . . . Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest need to start working together to tackle this threat. I have yet to see them take steps to break down communications, coordination and collaboration barriers between the companies. Instead, they remain stuck in a competitive race where consumers continue to come a distant second. "
Matthijs Tieleman, The Washington Post: "As in the 18th century, there are invisible forces that try to incite our passions, whether that is for geopolitical gain, ad income or even something as innocent as seeking our votes. If we want to keep the free society most of us cherish, it is our responsibility to be reasonable and not rush to judgment, to consume news from multiple perspectives and be open to changing our minds every now and then. "
What our readers are saying
My dad taught us at a very young age, don't believe anything you read and only half of what you see. We are being manipulated by all sorts of information coming from all sides. We need to do better at not being so reactive and quick to make judgments without vetting the information.
— Courtney Jarrell
We have become so dependent and misinformed by Facebook and Twitter. We accept any information that appears semi-legitimate and are too lazy to research for ourselves!
— Todd Brown
I think there should be consequences for promoting lies about political candidates. I know there's free speech, but spreading lies to smear a good, viable candidate is just wrong.
— Maggie Gabriele
Why is the spread of misinformation even legal? Take the people who do this down. Ban them from Twitter and Facebook, already. The last thing we need is extremists filling social media with lies to stir up more hatred and division.

Don Shirley's family dismayed by 'Green Book' Oscar wins, calls portrait of pianist false

Texto completo: It’s hard to package history, race and truth in one cinematic box.
Hollywood claims to have done this with “Green Book,” which won three Academy Awards Sunday night, including best picture.
The story was based on the friendship between Anthony “Lip” Vallelonga, an Italian-American bouncer from the Bronx and renowned African-American musician Don Shirley, whom Vallelonga in 1962 chauffeured through the Deep South.
As he accepted the best picture Oscar, "Green Book" director Peter Farrelly said the film that featured Mahershala Ali as Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Vallelonga was about “love” at a time when race, class and prejudice divided much of the country.
But there is no love for Vallelonga from members of the Shirley family, who say they and their potential contributions to the film were shut out.
When Ali won the supporting actor Oscar, Shirley's family was on Skype.
“Everybody was happy for Mahershala Ali and the first words out of his mouth was thank you to Dr. Don Shirley," said Shirley’s niece, Jasmin Shirley.
But jubilation turned to anger when it was announced that "Green Book" received an Oscar for best original screenplay, and then best picture.
“I was livid. . . . There was no recognition of my Uncle Donald or our family,” Jasmin Shirley said. Indeed, director Spike Lee seemed ready to walk out of the Dolby Theatre after the best picture win - "the ref made a bad call" he quipped backstage - and Twitter seemed miffed that Hollywood picked what some described as a white savior film over "Black Panther" and Lee’s "BlacKkKlansman. "
Farrelly and co-writer Nick Vallelonga didn't mention the Shirley family in their acceptance speeches, but Vallelonga, son of Anthony Vallelonga, addressed the controversy when he spoke to journalists backstage at the awards show.
"If you're discussing the Don Shirley family thing, that falls on me; but Don Shirley himself told me to not speak to anyone. He told me the story that he wanted to tell," Vallelonga said. "He told me, 'If you're going to tell the story, you tell it from your father, me. No one else. Don't speak to anyone else. That's how you have to make it. ' And, also, he told me, 'Don't make it until after I pass away. ' So I just kept my word to that man. I wish I could have reached out to Don Shirley's family. I didn't even know they really existed until after we were making the film, and we contacted his estate for music; and then the filmmakers, we invited them all to screenings and discussions. But I personally was not allowed to speak to his family, per Don Shirley's wishes. . . . I kept my word to the man, and that's the reason for that. "
'Finally the door is wide open': Oscars' big winner is diversity
More: Spike Lee slams 'Green Book' as best picture: 'The ref made a bad call!'
Members of Shirley’s family say the depiction of Shirley is inaccurate. For starters, they say Vallelonga was hired to drive Shirley on a tour of historically black colleges and universities, not a tour of segregated venues across the South. The lens through which the story is framed is another issue.
“The thing that bothers our family is the focus of the film is all about a white man who was an extreme racist who was still a racist at the end,” said Karole Shirley Kimble, daughter of Shirley’s brother Maurice. “Clearly, our family has a legacy of black excellence and family pride. Our concern is that (this) white director presented one person’s perspective. ”
On Sunday, Vallelonga talked about the effect the pianist had on both him and his father.
"I met Dr. Shirley when I was a kid. I went to his home. I went to Carnegie Hall. . . . I saw his beautiful African robes, and I saw the man that he was. And I saw the change in my father when he came home and over the years how he brought us up. So when he told me the story, because he was so angry when he went on this trip with Dr. Shirley (about) what he saw and witnessed, that's what changed him. . . .
"It's about their relationship and how they changed each other in a time when it was crazy, obviously. So I think we brought great honor to Dr. Shirley. His name is out in the world. We brought great honor to the 'Green Book'. People know about the 'Green Book'. And Pete (Farrelly) directed a magnificent film, and here we are. "
USA TODAY reached out to Universal for additional comments from Farrelly and Vallelonga. After his Golden Globes win in January, Ali said he had reached out to the family. "At the end of the day you wish everyone was happy and you don’t want to offend anyone in any capacity,” he said according to a Deadline report.
Oscars 2019: 'Green Book' wins best picture, overcomes backlash with three awards
Video: Donald Shirley, in his own words
What is not in dispute is that Vallelonga used the guidebook to find places for he and Shirley to eat and sleep. "The Negro Motorist Green Book" was created by Victor Green, a New York city postal worker, and published between 1936 and 1967. It was as cherished as the family bible for many African-American families who often made long trips across the country on dark highways lined with segregated corridors and hate.
The book grew in popularity and size thanks to J. D. Rockefeller and his Esso gas stations, but fell out of favor in the 1960s once accommodations were integrated. A Smithsonian Channel documentary, “The Green Book Guide to Freedom,” featuring home movies of African-American families, debuted Feb. 25.
Kimble said had the movie makers asked the family, they could have given filmmakers a more realistic view of Shirley’s tour.
“They didn’t (include) my family," Kimble said. "They didn’t listen to the other side of the story. They listened to other whites talk about my uncle. ”
Donald Walbridge Shirley was born in Pensacola, Florida, on Jan. 29, 1927. His parents were Jamaican immigrants. His father, Edwin, was an Episcopal priest and his mother, Stella, worked as a schoolteacher. She died two days after delivering Shirley's brother, Maurice, who eventually became a psychologist. Two other brothers, Calvin Hylton Shirley and Edwin Shirley Jr. , became physicians. Donald Shirley earned three doctorates.
“Grandfather Shirley believed that there was a time to work and a time to play. He believed in the scripture that obedience is better than sacrifice, and he molded his children and grandchildren in that way,” said Kimble, adding that after their mother died, the brothers worked hard at cooking and cleaning so that their father wouldn't get married again. But Edwin Shirley did marry again after he moved the family to Fort Lauderdale, and he and his new wife had a daughter, Edwina.
A prodigy, Shirley began playing piano at age 3. By 9, he was studying music theory at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music. He started playing professionally in 1945 at age 17 with the Boston Pops, performing Tchaikovsky’s "Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat. "
“At every stop, his family was there,” said Jasmin Shirley, adding that he learned to play from his mother, who was the organist at St. Cyprian Episcopal Church in Pensacola.
The Shirleys lived in St. Cyprian's parsonage, in the shadows of the Belmont-DeVilliers neighborhood, a booming African-American business corridor in 1930s Pensacola. The area was filled with churches, business owners, medical professionals, funeral homes and large family homes.
“I remember the Shirley boys playing in this house,” said Maggie Polkinghorne Wilson, 84, whose brother was Lt. James Porkinghorne, a Tuskegee Airman and World War II pilot.
Shirley attended the Catholic University of America as well as the University of Chicago, and earned doctorates in music, psychology and liturgical arts. But he became disenchanted with musical performance.
In a 2018 video from a planned, never completed documentary with the working title of “Let It Shine: Don Shirley," he was filmed in his New York City apartment above Carnegie Hall, where he talked about his goals.
“I was dead set on being, all my life, what I was trained to be, although I had to go through the back doors of the nightclub,” Shirley said.
Despite performing with symphonies in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and other cities, Shirley ended up taking the advice of New York theater producer Sol Hurok, who told him that white audiences in the United States were not ready for a “colored” playing classical piano on the concert stage. He was better received in overseas venues from Africa to Europe.
“He was a child prodigy but he couldn’t be a classical pianist because of the color of his skin. You can hear the pain in his voice. You can see his anger. He was angry because he was disrespected,” Jasmin Shirley said of the documentary.
The film portrays Shirley as a lonely man who was estranged from his family. But Kimble said Don Shirley kept up with his family until he died on April 6, 2013.
“His biggest treat was traveling to Milan, Italy, and performing at La Scala, the world’s largest opera house,” Kimble said. "Do you realize I am the first black to perform at La Scala?" Shirley said in the video.
Shirley recorded hundreds of pieces, and two of his favorites was a remake of “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” and “This Little Light of Mine. ”
Shirley blended classical music with jazz and pop music to create his own style. But to his own frustration, most of his performances were in nightclubs instead of concert halls, and he sought to differentiate himself from regular nightclub performers.
“They smoke while they're playing, and they'll put the glass of whisky on the piano, and then they'll get mad when they're not respected like (classical pianist) Arthur Rubinstein," Shirley said in a 1982 New York Times interview. "You don't see Arthur Rubinstein smoking and putting a glass on the piano. . . . The black experience through music, with a sense of dignity, that's all I have ever tried to do. ”

Texto completo: I can't stop thinking about a photograph that has been making the rounds on social media: David Hockney and Joni Mitchell holding hands earlier this month as they walk through Hockney's new exhibition at L.A. Louver Gallery in Venice. (Just put those names into a search engine and the image will come up.)
There's Hockney -- colorful in an unstructured blue jacket, lime-green cardigan and pink and red-striped tie -- looking like a figure from one of his own paintings. Mitchell wears an elaborately knitted sweater and holds a cane. They are instantly recognizable, and yet no longer quite their iconic selves.
One reason the photo has stirred such interest is that its subjects are emblematic Los Angeles celebrities -- and celebrity, as all good Angelenos recognize, remains among the city's strongest currencies. But Mitchell and Hockney are now far removed from their luminary younger incarnations, the artists' images we probably think of when we hear their names.

Hockney is 81; Mitchell is 75. They are legends, yes, but legends who -- miraculously, transcendently -- look their age.
Hockney was born in Bradford, England, and fell in love with California watching Laurel and Hardy on the screen. "I knew even as a child," he told the New York Times in 2001, "that it was sunny in Los Angeles because even though Laurel and Hardy wore overcoats, they cast long shadows. There were no long shadows in Bradford. I noticed that."
Mitchell grew up in Saskatchewan, Canada; she contracted polio at the age of 9, and later had a child out of wedlock. "I wouldn't have pursued music but for trouble," she has said. In a very real sense, she came "home" to Los Angeles: "Oh California," she has sung, "I'm your greatest fan."
Each of them landed here during the 1960s and quickly began producing work that defines Southern California -- then and now. Think of Hockney's swimming pool paintings, and Mitchell's albums "Ladies of the Canyon" or "The Hissing of Summer Lawns." The confluence of place, time and talent, it seems, enabled them to become what they arrived in Los Angeles hoping to be.
Still, what happens to an icon when he or she grows old?
It's a valid question in a city where age has long been treated as anathema. Just think of all those plastic surgery disasters (or successes), all those midlife-crisis cars. Think of the way very famous and accomplished people suddenly drop off the radar, as if their shelf life has expired.
In his 1947 essay "Hollywood," Truman Capote offered a trenchant observation of the mid-20th century Los Angeles' discomfort with the subject. "A teacher here," he wrote, "recently gave a vocabulary test in which she asked her students to provide the antonym of 'youth.' Over half the class answered 'death.'"
This is, of course, as big a cliche as the one about strivers like Hockney and Mitchell seeking fame and fortune on the edge of the continent. But that doesn't mean it also isn't true. Cliches aren't necessarily inaccurate; they just don't tell us anything new.
And so it charms us, shocks us even, to see Hockney and Mitchell embrace age. He had a minor stroke in 2012; his hearing has been impaired for more than 40 years. She suffers from Morgellons disease, and in 2015 a brain aneurysm required her to learn to walk again.
Nonetheless, his opening at L.A. Louver was packed to the rafters, while a two-night celebration of her 75th birthday in November at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion -- featuring performances by, among others, James Taylor, Norah Jones, Los Lobos and Chaka Khan -- drew sellout crowds.
Their staying power derives, at least in part, from their singularity. They were always offbeat idols: too angular, too interesting to be merely stars. Now that they are older, this only feels more heightened and profound. The photograph evokes their eccentricities and their signature style, from Hockey's cap and round glasses to Mitchell's sharp cheekbones and long braid.
The response to their image on social media may be a sign -- or so I'd like to imagine -- that Los Angeles is becoming more angular and interesting as well. It couldn't happen soon enough. The time is long since past for the city to set aside its obsession with the new and shiny and think beyond the voluptuous lure of the next big thing.
Hockney and Mitchell in 2019 may serve to open up our vision to what is possible, as they have done throughout their creative lives, illustrating the grace with which we might build a continuum between the present and the past. Even a place as relentlessly forward-focused as Los Angeles can't deny the charisma of these artists; it can't restrict its icons to the latest wave.
Youth, in other words, is important, but so is endurance. Mitchell and Hockney endure.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The House Judiciary Committee believes it has evidence that President Trump asked Matthew Whitaker, at the time the acting attorney general, whether Manhattan U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman could regain control of his office's investigation into Mr. Trump's former lawyer and his real-estate business, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Berman, a former law partner of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani who in 2016 donated to the Trump campaign and whom the president personally interviewed for the U.S. attorney job, last year had recused himself from involvement in the matter . He didn't give a reason, but legal experts said his interim status at the time the probe began would have made his involvement appear improper. The investigation began as a probe of the business dealings of Michael Cohen , Mr. Trump's former lawyer, and has broadened to examine the Trump Organization.
Mr. Cohen on Wednesday is set to deliver public testimony for the first time before the House Oversight Committee, in which he is expected to talk about his decade of working for Mr. Trump and about the hush-money payments he arranged during the 2016 campaign to women who alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to charges including campaign-finance violations and lying to Congress, and last year he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Federal prosecutors have directly implicated the president in the payoff scheme, referring to him in court papers as "Individual-1," alleging publicly what The Wall Street Journal previously had detailed in its reporting on those payments.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing.
There is no sign Mr. Whitaker acted on any request from Mr. Trump, which the New York Times reported last week . But the House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Mr. Whitaker may have perjured himself in his appearance before the panel earlier this month , according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Whitaker told the panel: "At no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel's investigation or any other investigation."
Any evidence that Mr. Trump sought to intervene in the federal prosecutors' probe could propel further lines of inquiry by lawmakers into whether he has tried to obstruct the investigation into his business dealings.
Mr. Trump, a person close to the president said, is expected to aggressively defend himself after Mr. Cohen's Wednesday testimony, which the former Trump lawyer postponed following threats he alleged were made by the president against his father-in-law. But the timing of the testimony will also pose a complication: Mr. Trump will be in Vietnam , preparing for a second summit the next day with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
During his Feb. 8 hearing, Mr. Whitaker also denied news reports that Mr. Trump had lashed out at him after federal prosecutors in late November obtained a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen, and he refused to say whether he had ever spoken to the president about the case. The Judiciary Committee said in a letter to Mr. Whitaker this month that it had identified individuals with direct knowledge of phone calls from Mr. Trump in which he had expressed frustration over Mr. Cohen's guilty pleas.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), the House Judiciary chairman, tweeted last week that the panel wanted the former acting attorney general to return and "clarify his testimony."
Mr. Whitaker declined to comment. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec also wouldn't comment on Mr. Whitaker's private conversations with the president, saying Mr. Whitaker stood by his committee testimony. Mr. Trump last week called reports of the conversation about Mr. Berman "fake news."
Mr. Trump in the past year has had frequent private discussions with advisers and allies in which he has complained about federal prosecutors, whose investigations into Mr. Trump's business and inaugural committee are examining dealings by some of the president's closest associates.
Several congressional committees have also said they plan to probe the hush-money payments Mr. Cohen arranged during the 2016 campaign to women who alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump.
People close to the president said he believes Mr. Cohen's coming testimony will be a distraction from his talks with Pyongyang. "What the president is doing with North Korea is a very, very big deal," one of the people said. "For that to be sidetracked for nothing other than a partisan shitshow—it'd frustrate any president," the person said.
The White House declined to comment.
White House advisers have privately expressed relief that the hearing will take place while the president is limited in his ability to monitor the coverage. "You're not going to have a president who is up in the White House residence watching the hearing and then watching the coverage for 24 hours straight," a person close to the president said. Even on the lengthy flight back to Washington, this person added, "that's one of the few places where the president doesn't have the full TiVo replay capacity that he does in the White House and residence."
Mr. Trump has also expressed irritation that Congress is now examining Mr. Cohen's business dealings, after federal prosecutors in New York spent months building a case and charging his former lawyer. "He's frustrated that Congress wants to keep peeling at this," one of the people close to Mr. Trump said.
Early last year, Mr. Trump was watching television in his private dining room in the White House as he vented about prosecutors' apparent growing interest in his and his associates' finances.
Talking to advisers, Mr. Trump appeared concerned that an "out-of-control prosecutor" examining a person involved in large business transactions would easily be able to find a "technical violation," a person close to the president said.
"If they really want to, they can always find something on anyone," Mr. Trump said, according to this person.

He was called the "greatest athlete of the first half of the 20th century." The King of Sweden went further, calling him "the greatest athlete in the world." One of the most accomplished all-around athletes in history, Jim Thorpe had a strong tie to Marion County. For a brief period--two seasons in 1922-1923--he played for and coached the Oorang Indians, making LaRue, Ohio, the smallest town ever to have been the home of an NFL franchise.
Thorpe's life began in 1887, born on a reservation in Oklahoma. His father, Hiram Thorpe, was a farmer, and his mother, Mary James, a Pottawatomie Indian and descendant of the last great Sauk and Fox chief Black Hawk, a noted warrior and athlete. He lived up to his given name -- Wa-Tho-Huk -- which means "Bright Path."
In 1904, Thorpe started school at Carlisle Industrial Indian School in Pennsylvania. It was here that he began his athletic career, both playing football and running track. In football, coached by iconic football legend Glenn "Pop" Warner, he was named a two-time All-American and considered a marvel of speed, power, kicking, and all-around ability.
He was selected for the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, where the records he set in the pentathlon and decathlon would stand for decades. He was the first Native American to win a gold medal and returned home to that most American of honors--a ticker-tape parade in New York City.
The following year, the Olympics Committee learned that he had played two years of semi-professional baseball prior to the Games, determined that this violated their rules for amateur status, stripped him of his gold medals, and removed his name from the record books.
While that was the end of Thorpe's Olympic experience, albeit temporarily because his medals and records were reinstated posthumously in 1983, it was the beginning of his professional athletic career. He signed on and played six seasons of professional baseball with the New York Giants, Cincinnati Reds, and Boston Braves.
However, neither track and field nor baseball were the only sports in which he excelled. He was proficient in such diverse sports as boxing, lacrosse, swimming, and hockey. During much of his baseball years, Thorpe was also immersed in professional football. Between 1915-20, he played for the Canton Bulldogs, helping win three professional championships.
It was at this point in his illustrious career that he became acquainted with Walter Lingo, who put the novelty team, the Oorang Indians, together to market his dog kennels. Lingo raised Airedales and, because LaRue was once the site of an old Wyandot village, believed that a supernatural bond existed between the Indians and the dogs. The partnership was based on Lingo purchasing a football franchise and Thorpe running the team, which Lingo saw as a way of touring the country's leading cities to advertise his dogs.
All of the Indians players were Native American, with Jim Thorpe serving as its leading player and coach. Of the 20 games they played over two seasons, 1922-23, only one was played at "home" in Marion – at Lincoln Park. Thorpe would go on to form and lead the American Professional Football Association, the precursor to today's NFL. In all, Thorpe played with six different teams during his football career and, since 1955, the Jim Thorpe Trophy has been awarded annually to the NFL's most valuable player.
Even after his athletic career waned, Thorpe was a celebrity, working as an extra in movies, public speaker, and as a vocal advocate for Indian affairs. His athletic talents and the records he set continued to be acknowledged. In 1950, he was named "the greatest American football player" and the "greatest overall male athlete" by the Associated Press. ABC's Wide World of Sports named Thorpe the "Athlete of the Century." The Pro Football Hall of Fame inducted him as part of its inaugural class in 1963.
When Thorpe died in the spring of 1953, The New York Times ran a front page story, remembering the athlete, stating that Thorpe "was a magnificent performer" and describing him as an athlete of strength, speed, coordination, and incredible stamina.
LaRue native Bob Whitman, now living in Marysville, has donated newspapers, photos, letters and a variety of items relating to Jim Thorpe and his family, the National Football League Oorang Indians team, and Walter Lingo, who sponsored the team and owned the Oorang Dog Kennels that specialized in Airedales.

Inside View: Superheroes Are Rescuing Hollywood

Texto completo: I've been around the special effects and movie business for decades as an adviser and investor and had a front-row seat to the development of computer-generated imagery. On a tour of the back lot at Paramount Pictures in the early '90s, my host pointed to a shallow pool and said: "Here's where Charlton Heston parted the Red Sea in 'The Ten Commandments.'" I was impressed -- but playing my role as an annoying Silicon Valley visitor, I replied "Someday this will all be replaced by CGI." I was right. CGI has been the best thing to happen to the movie business -- and a curse.
Take a look at the top 10 domestic grossing films of 2018: "Black Panther," "Avengers: Infinity War," "Incredibles 2," "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom," "Aquaman," "Deadpool 2," "The Grinch," "Mission: Impossible -- Fallout," "Ant-Man and the Wasp" and "Solo: A Star Wars Story." Not a single one would have even been greenlit without computer graphics. I had to go back to 2014's "American Sniper" to find a top-10 grosser that wasn't CGI dependent. Even this year's dramatic films needed CGI, like re-creating 1985's Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in "Bohemian Rhapsody."
Except for "Mission: Impossible" they're all superhero movies and animations. The plots are similar and shallow: Outsmart villains, save the world, fight a giant monster, and resolve somebody's daddy issues. But they entertain. Movies are supposed to transport you somewhere else for 110 minutes, then drop you back into your mundane existence. You want to see something you've never seen before -- hence the success of watery "Aquaman" and vapid "Venom." Audiences want faraway galaxies, explosions and a little humor. And when that gets old, just have the superheroes fight each other.
The rest of Hollywood looks down their noses at comic-book movies, but they should be thankful. "Avengers: Infinity War" grossed more than $2 billion world-wide. In a decade, 20 Marvel superhero movies have grossed a total of more than $17 billion. That pays for a lot of dull arty films, flatulence-joke comedies and oversexed, cliched rom-coms that nobody goes to. It's as if Hollywood has forgotten how to make movies people want to go see. Whose idea was it to make the 2017 Matt Damon eco-dud "Downsizing," or Jennifer Lawrence's allegorical "Mother!"? I'd like my four hours back.
My wife hates watching movies with me. At the right moment each time, I lean over and say: "Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back," or some derivation. And when it inevitably happens, I say, "And there's the message."
The so-called dramatic films are just as bad. At the Oscars, the word "best" in best picture has been watered down to be almost meaningless. Same with "based on a true story." They're almost all message movies doing battle in America's overblown culture wars, and they either rehash past cultural transgressions, are antibusiness, or both. The CGI-heavy comic-book movies that pay the bills are filled with masculinity, toxic and otherwise, and it's almost as if the rest of the movies are pro bono work so Hollywood can sleep at night.
The acting is usually terrific and sometimes there's a decent plot, but often it's -- again -- daddy issues, as in "A Star Is Born." Hardly anyone watches one of the message movies these until it's been nominated as "best."
And of course, they have to have the right message. Ryan Coogler's terrific "Black Panther" was criticized for being too conservative. Its theme of "let's all work together" was considered not revolutionary enough. Really? Jeez, everyone's a critic. The last truly pro-business movie was "Ghostbusters," in 1984. When the villain from the Environmental Protection Agency orders the ghostbusters' "Containment Unit" shut down, Dr. Egon Spengler says: "Excuse me, this is private property!" Ah, the good old days.
Don't get me wrong -- I like many of today's films (well, not "A Star Is Born"). But when they fade to black I'm left with a bad feeling, sensing that I've been manipulated into a social-justice guilt trip. There's the message! Take last year's "Vice": a fun flick, but a shameless hit job on Dick Cheney (does he really sound like Batman?) and red meat for the "resistance." The 1984 mockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap" was more believable. "Bohemian Rhapsody" would have been just as good without the identity politics. Even the Disneyfied "Star Wars" franchise is no longer immune. When I want preaching, I'll go to a house of worship or read the New York Times.
CGI has killed straightforward moviemaking for art's sake. Consumers have new ways to spend time and dollars: streaming, binge-watching, posting cat videos. Make whatever movie you want, realistic or CGI-based fantasy, but viewers aren't dumb, and the preachy proof is at the box office. Outside superhero movies and few others, nobody goes. By the way, the videogame "Fortnite" grossed $300 million last April alone, and some $2.4 billion last year. Now that's entertainment.

Texto completo: We've all heard the cliched stories of an actor's struggles before a career breakthrough: living hand to mouth, waiting tables, temping, couch surfing and generally scraping by before landing that major role.
The star of "A Dog's Way Home," now in theaters, has a hard-luck tale that could top them all. Before her big break, she was living in a landfill, rooting through garbage for her next meal.
Meet Shelby, the tan-and-black mutt who portrays Bella, occupying the screen, often solo, for much of the film's 97 minutes - and whose trash-to-riches saga could itself be a gripping cinematic yarn.
Shelby's big break came in April 2017, when animal-control officer Megan Buhler was driving in Cheatham County, Tennessee, a rural area about 25 miles from Nashville. Out on an unrelated call, Buhler spotted and approached what she recalled was a noticeably skittish dog emerging from the dump.
"So I knelt down and just said, Oh, come here, baby,' said Buhler, 29. "There were lots of cars driving by - I mean, it was heavy traffic. She was so scared, and she finally came right up to me, and I was able to put her in my truck.
The pair headed to the county animal shelter, where the staff took to calling the new resident Baby Girl.
Buhler and TJ Jordi, then the shelter's animal-control director, had no inkling that 2,000 miles away, Hollywood was looking for a dog to play Bella in a film written by Cathryn Michon and W. Bruce Cameron and based on Cameron's book.
A central story line involves breed-specific legislation or local laws that prohibit certain dog breeds from living within municipalities or counties. In this case, the focus was Denver's ban on "pit bull breeds.
Cameron is a prolific author who specializes in dog books, perhaps most notably "A Dog's Purpose, which was on the New York Times bestseller list for nearly five months and was made into a 2017 movie starring Dennis Quaid. (A sequel to that film, "A Dog's Journey, opens May 17.)
Cameron and Michon, who are married, are unabashed dog lovers and say part of their passion is expressed by advocating for homeless dogs whenever possible.
"We started off in the very beginning saying that the dog that is the star of the movie will have to be a rescue, because we were trying to prove something, Cameron said. "We think we're making a difference in the animals' lives when they are adopted, and we're trying to reveal to the world that rescue dogs are wonderful animals.
The filmmakers hired trainer Debbie Pearl, whose company Paws for Effect functions as an animal talent agency of sorts, one known for finding adoptable dogs and training them for on-screen roles.
Pearl then assigned the find-a-Bella job to Teresa Ann Miller, a freelance trainer whose credits include "White God, an acclaimed 2014 Hungarian film that features more than 200 dogs. Miller's mission was to search shelters nationwide for a dog that could play Bella - and then give her the acting chops to do it.
"We initially started looking for a kind of Rottweiler/shepherd/pit bull mix, Miller said. "That's kind of what (Cameron's) book cover looked like to me.
Meanwhile, back in Tennessee, Baby Girl was already getting diva treatment. The shelter's staff believes that shooting stellar photographs of its animals immensely boosts their adoption prospects. Jordi, the former animal-control director, recalled being so encouraged by the results of the earliest photos that he "eventually built things up to the point we actually had a full studio setup.
One day, Miller spotted Baby Girl's adoption photo, which Jordi had taken.
"Honestly, it was a really good picture, and she was flat-out smiling, Miller said. "I mean, it was beautiful.
Still, Miller was wary. Two promising canine candidates already hadn't panned out, and a third possible Bella had been adopted out of a Los Angeles shelter the night before Miller was scheduled to meet and videotape the dog.
But the Miller-Baby Girl summit proceeded without a hitch, spanning two hours, with the trainer assessing her new friend on personality, temperament and the ability to respond to simple commands. Miller was sold.
Within two weeks, Cameron and Michon traveled to Tennessee, met Baby Girl and developed the same crush. In an email, Michon said that she was struck by "the extraordinary sweetness of her soul. Baby Girl, she added, "was loving, smart, oh-so-eager to please, and we knew instantly we had found our Bella.
In short order, Miller adopted Baby Girl from the shelter on behalf of Pearl and Paws for Effect, renamed her Shelby ("a really cute Southern name) and took her to California for training.
Miller said her approach reflects the style of her late father, a well-known Hollywood animal trainer, eschewing quick commands in favor of talking in sentences to elicit more relaxed behavior.
"Instead of saying, Come, sit, stay,' - you know, all these sharp commands where the dog's looking at the trainer - we might say: Can you come over here? Hey, what are you doing?' Miller explained. "She'll stop and she'll look around a little bit more, and I'll say, Why don't you go ... go lie down, put your feet up.' And she'll start to do it, and I'll say, That's good.' ... So it's kind of a different type of training technique.
Miller and Shelby trained for just over three months before filming began. Then they were together each day on the set. Most of the film's reviews, thumbs up or down, have lauded Shelby's performance. Variety wrote that the film "is at its best when relying on Shelby and her trainers: It's amazing how much of the humor, drama and emotion is carried on her canine shoulders.
Has its heroine gone Hollywood? Sunglasses at night? Not Shelby. After additional training, she's now working as a therapy dog on location at places that include veterans' facilities, hospitals and schools attended by students with special needs.
Shelby now lives with Pearl in Huntington Beach, California. And at age 2

Superheroes Are Rescuing Hollywood; You can thumb your nose at CGI slugfests, but their success buoys the sinking industry.

Texto completo: I've been around the special effects and movie business for decades as an adviser and investor and had a front-row seat to the development of computer-generated imagery. On a tour of the back lot at Paramount Pictures in the early '90s, my host pointed to a shallow pool and said: "Here's where Charlton Heston parted the Red Sea in 'The Ten Commandments.'" I was impressed—but playing my role as an annoying Silicon Valley visitor, I replied "Someday this will all be replaced by CGI." I was right. CGI has been the best thing to happen to the movie business—and a curse.
Take a look at the top 10 domestic grossing films of 2018: "Black Panther," "Avengers: Infinity War," "Incredibles 2," "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom," "Aquaman," "Deadpool 2," "The Grinch," "Mission: Impossible—Fallout," "Ant-Man and the Wasp" and "Solo: A Star Wars Story." Not a single one would have even been greenlit without computer graphics. I had to go back to 2014's "American Sniper" to find a top-10 grosser that wasn't CGI dependent. Even this year's dramatic films needed CGI, like re-creating 1985's Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in "Bohemian Rhapsody."
Except for "Mission: Impossible" they're all superhero movies and animations. The plots are similar and shallow: Outsmart villains, save the world, fight a giant monster, and resolve somebody's daddy issues. But they entertain. Movies are supposed to transport you somewhere else for 110 minutes, then drop you back into your mundane existence. You want to see something you've never seen before—hence the success of watery "Aquaman" and vapid "Venom." Audiences want faraway galaxies, explosions and a little humor. And when that gets old, just have the superheroes fight each other.
The rest of Hollywood looks down their noses at comic-book movies, but they should be thankful. "Avengers: Infinity War" grossed more than $2 billion world-wide. In a decade, 20 Marvel superhero movies have grossed a total of more than $17 billion. That pays for a lot of dull arty films, flatulence-joke comedies and oversexed, clichéd rom-coms that nobody goes to. It's as if Hollywood has forgotten how to make movies people want to go see. Whose idea was it to make the 2017 Matt Damon eco-dud "Downsizing," or Jennifer Lawrence's allegorical "Mother!"? I'd like my four hours back.
My wife hates watching movies with me. At the right moment each time, I lean over and say: "Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back," or some derivation. And when it inevitably happens, I say, "And there's the message."
The so-called dramatic films are just as bad. At the Oscars, the word "best" in best picture has been watered down to be almost meaningless. Same with "based on a true story." They're almost all message movies doing battle in America's overblown culture wars, and they either rehash past cultural transgressions, are antibusiness, or both. The CGI-heavy comic-book movies that pay the bills are filled with masculinity, toxic and otherwise, and it's almost as if the rest of the movies are pro bono work so Hollywood can sleep at night.
The acting is usually terrific and sometimes there's a decent plot, but often it's—again—daddy issues, as in "A Star Is Born." Hardly anyone watches one of the message movies these days until it's been nominated as "best."
And of course, they have to have the right message. Ryan Coogler's terrific "Black Panther" was criticized for being too conservative. Its theme of "let's all work together" was considered not revolutionary enough. Really? Jeez, everyone's a critic. The last truly pro-business movie was "Ghostbusters," in 1984. When the villain from the Environmental Protection Agency orders the ghostbusters' "Containment Unit" shut down, Dr. Egon Spengler says: "Excuse me, this is private property!" Ah, the good old days.
Don't get me wrong—I like many of today's films (well, not "A Star Is Born"). But when they fade to black I'm left with a bad feeling, sensing that I've been manipulated into a social-justice guilt trip. There's the message! Take last year's "Vice": a fun flick, but a shameless hit job on Dick Cheney (does he really sound like Batman?) and red meat for the "resistance." The 1984 mockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap" was more believable. "Bohemian Rhapsody" would have been just as good without the identity politics. Even the Disneyfied "Star Wars" franchise is no longer immune. When I want preaching, I'll go to a house of worship or read the New York Times.
CGI has killed straightforward moviemaking for art's sake. Consumers have new ways to spend time and dollars: streaming, binge-watching, posting cat videos. Make whatever movie you want, realistic or CGI-based fantasy, but viewers aren't dumb, and the preachy proof is at the box office. Outside superhero movies and few others, nobody goes. By the way, the videogame "Fortnite" grossed $300 million last April alone, and some $2.4 billion last year. Now that's entertainment.

Honest dialogue needed about health care for all

Texto completo: It's been nearly 10 years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act — one of the most sweeping health care overhauls in the nation's history. The law has brought the number of uninsured people in America to an all-time low, secured protections for people with pre-existing conditions and advanced the notion that health care is a human right.
But the system was never perfect, and its fractures and stress points have become too great to ignore. The number of people who are uninsured or underinsured is rising again after two years of sabotage to the current law by the Trump administration. A Republican-led lawsuit that once seemed like a lark is threatening Obamacare's protections for pre-existing conditions. And high out-of-pocket costs, absurd hospital billing practices and ever-rising prescription drug prices have forced too many people to skip crucial treatments, avoid emergency rooms and ration life-sustaining medications.
America may be a country rich in medical innovation — a place where robots perform surgery — but it's also one where tens of thousands of people die every year because they can't afford basic care.
Both parties seem certain to make health care a significant election issue over the next two years. There are no fewer than six Democratic bills floating through Congress that would address these problems. And "Medicare for all" — a concept that describes only some of those proposals — has become both a rallying cry and a test of progressive credentials.
Most other countries use negotiating power to control health care costs; that's why prescription drugs cost so much less elsewhere than they do in the United States. But those countries accept a trade-off, inherent in this approach, that the United States has so far resisted: They forgo access to certain innovations, like pricey new drugs and medical devices whose benefits are found to be minimal.
The fight to once again remake American health care will almost certainly be brutal. Before voters can decide if they want to have that fight, candidates will need to clarify what they are selling. Only then can the nation have an honest dialogue about the risks, benefits and trade-offs ahead.

Not so fast, California high-speed rail

Texto completo: Welcome to Inside Desert Politics, your guide to the happenings in Coachella Valley, California and national politics. I'm Marie McCain, your host.
In this week's edition, the U.S. ambassador to Germany makes a plan; Gov. Newsom and President Trump declare war over high-speed rail funds; and Bernie Sanders says he'll pledge to go blue in order to win it all in 2020.
It's official: Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, this past Tuesday, began his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in the hopes of ultimately unseating incumbent Republican President Donald Trump.
Making his announcement in a recorded video, Sanders, whose plain-spoken directness and underdog popularity made him a household name and ultimately landed him in second place behind Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Dem nomination, is still hell-bent on taking down what he calls the "billionaire class."
"Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice," he said in his video announcement. "This campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life."
Calling Trump the "most dangerous president in modern American history," Sanders appears to have banished any residual distrust of the Democratic National Committee, which blatantly favored Clinton in 2016.
A day after Sanders' announcement, his senior campaign adviser told CNN that Sanders would sign a pledge to run as a Democrat and also serve as one, should he win the office.
For real though ... Part-time Palm Springs resident Richard Grenell, who serves as the Trump administration's U.S. ambassador to Germany, is pledging to work to decriminalize homosexuality around the world.
He reportedly discussed his plans during a dinner this past week at his Berlin residence with "about a dozen gay and transgender activists from around Europe," according to The New York Times. He also posed for photos with some of the attendees, who posted a couple of the pictures on Twitter.
But Grenell, who is openly gay, apparently neglected to share his plans with his boss.
Yahoo News reported that when President Trump was asked about Grenell's plans during a media availability in the White House, he appeared to genuinely have no clue.
According to Yahoo News a reporter asked him: "Mr. President, on your push to decriminalize homosexuality, are you doing that? And why?"
Trump indicated he didn't hear the question, so the reporter repeated it.
His response: "I don't know which report you're talking about. We have many reports. ... Next question."
However, that same day, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted: "This is a really big deal and with @richardgrenell at the helm it will get done!!!" He attached a link to an NBC story about Grenell's plans.
Later, a State Department spokesman reportedly said Grenell's plans are "a continuation of longstanding American policy."
Huh?
Not so fast California Gov. Gavin Newsom traded taunts this week with Trump over billions in federal funding California has received and is still set to receive in order to build a proposed high-speed rail system that was originally supposed to span the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
However, Newsom, in his Feb. 12 State of the State address, said the project would be scaled back to a rail system that would, instead, link Bakersfield to Merced.
He also stated that despite the change, California would keep the $3.5 billion in federal funds earmarked for the plan (i.e.: $2.5 billion already spent and another $929 million that was still to come).
But the president had different plans. The U.S. Department of Transportation announced, earlier this week, it would cancel the remaining allotment of money.
Newsom has vowed to fight the decision.
Insult meet injury Piggybacking on the Trump administration's plans to take back the funds for California's proposed high-speed rail system, state Sen. Jeff Stone, R-La Quinta, announced proposed legislation that would make it illegal for state authorities to sell any remaining general obligation bonds for use in the construction of a high-speed rail project, as authorized by voters under 2008's Proposition 1A.
"California's High-Speed Rail is nothing more than the construction of an unsustainable and unachievable boondoggle dream," Stone said in announcing his plan. "Voters approved this project with the hope of funding economic transformation. ... it seems clear now is the time to cut bait and admit the fantasy has failed."
Making a choice Delegates are gathering this weekend in Sacramento for the California Republican Party's convention where they will cast their votes for the party's new chair.
There are three candidates on the ballot: 2018 Republican gubernatorial candidate Travis Allen, veteran GOP activist Steve Frank, and state party vice chair David Hadley.
Check back next week to learn who won.
In other news ... On Friday, Feb. 22, Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia, D-Coachella, and California Secretary for Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot had a sit down with members of the Salton Sea Authority. They also toured the San Jose Mobile Home Park in Thermal to view the eastern Coachella Valley's water infrastructure disparities.
At 2 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 23, Democrats of the Desert will hold elections for positions on the group's board of directors at the Date Palm Country Club, 36-200 Date Palm Drive in Cathedral City. Seats up for grabs: president, treasurer, membership chair, political action chair, fundraising chair. For more information call the group's office at (760) 808-4446.
On Tuesday, March 5, Yucca Valley Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes' New Way California, an organization "committed to building trust and achieving bi-partisan solutions," will hold its second annual summit in Sacramento. Confirmed speakers include former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and former Assemblywoman Catharine Baker. Information: newwayca.org/summit

Texto completo: The American Contemporary Music Ensemble, better known by its acronym, ACME, came to Portland on Thursday evening to offer a varied, if remarkably concise, overview of modernist styles, ranging from Morton Feldman's 1960's experiments in textural sparseness and Charlemagne Palestine's 1974 essay in gradually expanding Minimalist repetition, to Philip Glass's post-Minimal neo-Classicism and a tape-loop-driven sound picture by Clarice Jensen, the ensemble's artistic director and cellist.
The concert, which was presented by Portland Ovations, was also a collaboration with the Institute of Contemporary Art at the Maine College of Art, and took place in the school's Lunder Gallery, amid the artworks in the institute's "Drawing Now."
There is a long tradition of staging contemporary music in galleries, where artists' and composers' sensibilities often dovetail affectingly. In Portland, for example, new-music concerts are more typically presented at Space, just a few doors from MECA. It's good to see the school getting into the contemporary concert business as well, and in this case, the exhibition's works, many of them black and white, and starkly geometrical, suited the music perfectly.
Jensen opened the program on her own, with the second (and longer) movement of "For This From That Will Be Filled," the title work of her 2018 solo recording. The work's backdrop is an electronic score, built of drones, looped sounds, ambient recording made at Grand Central Station in New York and other sounds that are difficult to distinguish but create a solid, sometimes aggressive fabric.
Against all that, Jensen's solo lines alternately weave through the din and soar over it, but if you're looking at the cello line as the sole source of musical development, you're looking in the wrong place: Much of the action actually happens in the dense electronic score, where subtle shifts of color and weight periodically give way to more sudden and striking change. The cello line, by contrast, seems almost a quaint throwback to an earlier era, asserting itself, not always successfully, within the high-tech texture.
Glass's String Quartet No. 5 (1991) seemed tamely conventional by comparison, and in a way, it is: Glass, by this point, had abandoned the "additive process" approach that defined his early work - a style in which musical lines were repeated many times, yet subtly altered by the addition of notes or phrases after a certain number of repetitions. That process, fresh and effective in its day, saddled Glass with a reputation as a composer who did nothing but repeat himself.
Even in the early days that was not quite accurate, but by the time of the Quartet No. 5, repetition was hardly his signature move. That's not to say that there isn't any, but phrases may be repeated two or three times before giving way to something entirely different, rather than 40 or 50 times before being gradually altered. Here, he begins with a sweetly harmonized theme with an almost Gallic accent, and makes his way quite far afield, over 23 minutes, touching on blues figures, shimmering fast textures, a brief (and startling) pizzicato episode and even an allusion to the ascending and descending "rocket" figures heard in "Einstein on the Beach."
Feldman is sometimes thought of as a proto-Minimalist, not because he used repetition (he didn't, and Minimalism was always about more than that), but because he tended to reduce his musical materials to the bare essentials - quiet, sustained pitches, silences, gentle dissonances - explored over long stretches of time, sometimes as much as five hours.
Feldman's "Durations II" (1960), for piano, violin and cello, and the pointillistic "Durations IV" (1961), with a vibraphone replacing the piano, are outliers in that they each run less than five minutes. But all the other elements are intact in these graceful, alluring works, which exert a hypnotic effect and all but demand that the listener examine each tone and combination of timbres from multiple perspectives.
As its finale, ACME played Jensen's arrangement of Charlemagne Palestine's "Strumming Music" (1974), a work in which repetition is a motivating force, with a generally (but not absolutely) steady rhythm heard throughout, almost as a pulse. It was the only work performed by the full ensemble - violinists Ben Russell and Ravenna Lipchik, violist Caleb Burhans, pianist Peter Dugan, Jensen on cello and Chihiro Shibayama on vibraphone - and it involved constantly recalibrated, consistently attractive textures.
There is no such thing as a definitive performance of a work like "Strumming Music." Palestine was liberal about tempos, durations and even scoring (the piece was originally for piano, and he created a version for strings). His own recording runs about 54 minutes. ACME's version was about half that length.

In our opinion: Opportunity zone investment is a solid policy approach for Utah

Texto completo: Discussions about addressing wealth inequality typically lead to costly, government-heavy solutions. A market-based proposal, however, is already in place and gaining momentum.
It involves investment by large money interests in so-called “opportunity zones” designated by state and local governments, often in partnership with private philanthropic organizations. Such investment has been made attractive by a component of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that offers sizeable tax breaks to those who invest in troubled communities in ways that might end up improving infrastructure, creating jobs or increasing the availability of affordable housing.
So far, there are 8,100 designated opportunity zones, including 46 in Utah. On the investment side, at least 80 “opportunity funds” have been created while fund organizers have reportedly raised nearly $20 billion. There is an altruistic component, but the investments are also potentially very lucrative for those with large amounts of investible assets. The tax plan allows those who invest in such funds to exempt up to 15 percent of the original capital gain from the funds invested, depending on how long they maintain their involvement. In addition, no taxes would be owed on gains in the value of the investment.
The plan has sparked widespread interest in hedge fund circles, potentially leading to a healthy pipeline of investment from Wall Street to Main Street. A recent conference in Salt Lake City on the growing interest in opportunity investment was profiled in an article in The New York Times.
The “opportunity investment” approach to combating poverty does indeed involve taxpayer subsidy, but it comes in the form of tax breaks as opposed to continuously funneling money for social programs. It's a welcome contrast from the idea of “new socialism,” involving a government-led assault on social and environmental problems, not unlike what the country saw during the New Deal in the 1930s, and the War on Poverty decades later.
Both eras witnessed a surge of social programs dependent upon large government involvement, including the construction of sprawling housing projects in urban areas. In the current context, there is a compelling argument to incentivize the private sector to grab a stake in the fight against things like intergenerational poverty, rather than levying higher taxes on the wealthy to finance what would inevitably become a bureaucratic front in that battle.
As a real-world example, a chronic shortage of affordable housing along the Wasatch Front is leading cities and counties to offer various subsides for residential development. If private investors were to swoop into the seven “opportunity zones” outlined by Salt Lake City’s economic development office, the need for those subsidies would, in a word, subside. Tax money would still be involved, but market-based influences would determine the nature of development in a way that would be arguably more efficient and responsive to long-term needs.
Society is better off when both the public and private sector find unique solutions to difficult problems. Opportunity zones provide a way to tap private money to help a community.

Texto completo: Peace talks between the Taliban and the U.S. have brought back memories of the negotiations that led to the end of America's war in Vietnam. They're also reminiscent of an earlier effort by the U.S. to bring about a peace deal in Asia -- specifically, in China after World War II. That effort ended in complete failure.
The U.S. goal in China was to save a pro-American ally, the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, from being overthrown by Mao Zedong's communists. The Truman administration didn't want to go to war to save the Nationalists, so it turned to diplomacy -- pretending neutrality and dispatching Gen. George C. Marshall to broker a deal to produce a democratic coalition government.
Today's Afghan government bears disconcerting similarities to the Chinese Nationalists. It is preferred by the U.S. but appears unable to survive without American military support. The Taliban, like the Maoists, are determined and fanatically ideological.
The U.S. effort in China began on Aug. 27, 1945, two weeks after the Japanese surrender, when American Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley escorted Mao to China's wartime capital of Chungking for talks with Chiang aimed at averting the threatened civil war. From Hurley's point of view, things got off to a promising start. After five weeks of talks with Chiang, Mao proclaimed his own wish to "stop [the] civil war" and "unite under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to build modern China."
Mao didn't mean it. As soon as he returned to his headquarters in China's northwest, he assured colleagues that what he'd said in Chungking was "words" with nothing to do with "reality." Mao was following a strategy that Marshall's chief interlocutor, Zhou Enlai, summed up in the phrase "talk talk fight fight."
Mao and his men made all the right gestures to deter the U.S. from increasing support of Chiang. Zhou made a show of what Marshall called the communists' "desire . . . for the establishment of a coalition government." The communists assured American diplomats and journalists, with whom they cultivated warm relationships, of their admiration for American democracy and their disavowal of Soviet-style dictatorship. Talk talk.
Fight fight: At the same time, the communists mounted guerrilla attacks against U.S. Marines stationed in China, killing 13 in an implicit warning to the U.S. of the cost if it interfered on Chiang's side in a civil war. For all his faults, Chiang understood -- as many American diplomats and journalists didn't -- that the communists' unalterable objective was to use their army to achieve complete power in China and then to effect a revolutionary transformation of Chinese society. That's exactly what they did after they came to power in 1949, dropping the pretense that they admired democracy.
Is the Taliban also playing talk talk fight fight? The main question is whether it would really share power with the Kabul government -- the only favorable outcome the negotiations could produce. Will they really, as they're promising, respect the rights of girls and women? Or is that just talk? Given their past ruthlessness and determination, there would seem to be little reason to doubt that the Taliban are driven by ideological zeal and a thirst for power, as the Chinese communists were.
Is the Taliban's goal to induce the U.S. to withdraw its remaining troops, and, once that's done, to resume its bitter, long-term struggle for total power? It worked for Mao.

AJC TRENDS THE KONMARI METHOD: KonMari mania sparks joy in consignment world: Boosted by TV show, industry sees surge in clothing, other goods.

Texto completo: January is always a busy month for consignment stores as homeowners, hoarders and everyone in between clear their closets for the new year. At Finders Keepers Fashions in Avondale Estates, Jan. 26 was the deadline for winter drop-offs. Luckily, owner Bonnie Kallenberg staffed two locations a little more than usual for the yearly rush.
"We had well over 100 dropoffs and not only was it 100 dropoffs, it was 100 huge drop-offs," Kallenberg said.Consignors came in dragging bags full of clothing and accessories for "drop and runs," which means that even if the store can't sell it in 60 days, the consignors don't want it back.
Kallenberg wasn't sure what prompted the bigger-than-usual drops until she listened closely to the chatter. Almost everyone, it seemed, was speaking the same language.
"People let go of things that did not spark joy," Kallenberg said, using the words made famous by Marie Kondo, the 34-year-old Japanese organizing consultant and author whose new Netflix series has led to a resurgence of Kon-Mari mania.
With the series debut on Jan. 1, Kondo is experiencing a second run of fame that began five years ago, with the U.S. release of her book "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing." The book lived on the New York Times best-seller list as Kondo built her KonMari lifestyle brand, but the Netflix series "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" has taken her message even deeper into the masses. The result is an onslaught of clothing, home goods and other items delivered with love to consignment and thrift stores across the country as more Americans try to live that KonMari life.
Kondo speaks little English (on the Netflix series, she travels with a translator and some of her advice is subtitled), but that hasn't stopped Americans from adopting her philosophy and declaring themselves Konverts to a method that some organizing pros have criticized as both draconian and the same thing they have been doing for decades. In 2016, Kondo began certifying consultants in her tidying methods. Today, there are more than 100 certified KonMari consultants in the U.S. though none are based in Georgia.
The KonMari mystique isn't just about discarding stuff, it is also the manner in which that work is done. Kondo wants us to lovingly interact with our mess -- touching and talking to items as we decide if they make us happy and setting them free when they don't. Organizing, she says, should be done by category and in a specific order (clothing, books, etc.) rather than room by room. What we keep should be sorted and folded in a way that is visible and accessible.
Those are strategies that Dr. Darria Gillespie employs in her own home. As an emergency room doctor based in Atlanta, everything in her life has to be timesaving, she said. Unorganized stuff only takes up valuable brain space, and the Kon-Mari Method is a great starting point to free your mind.
"The more you organize your house, whether it is clothes, food or books, the less you have to remember," said Gillespie, author of "Mom Hacks: 100+ Science-Backed Shortcuts to Reclaim Your Body, Raise Awesome Kids, and Be Unstoppable."
While her refrigerator isn't picture-perfect, Gillespie has posted images of her very visible vegetables -- chopped, stored and ready to eat. "Once you have done those things, you have opened up brain space, and you can use that for creativity, moments of quiet and being more intentional about your goals," she said.
Kallenberg has seen only one episode of Kondo's Netflix series, but she was already a KonMari fan, having gifted the book to several family members. "There are so many truths to it and I think it really helps people," said Kallenberg. "I have always felt like we need to put things back into the universe for someone else to find and love."
In her stores, she has seen the Kondo effect take hold not just among consignors but among shoppers as well. "They are thinking a little more before they are buying. If you don't love it, why are you buying it?" Kallenberg said.
Viewers of "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" know the transformative power of an organized home. Not an episode goes by without tears shed and revelations uncovered about relationships with people and stuff. Kondo makes appearances over a month or so offering encouraging lessons and a kind smile. As families struggle to let go of items with sentimental and monetary value, Kondo makes it clear that she is not there to do the work for them.
Under the KonMari Method, where the main criteria for keeping something is the joy it brings, plenty of worthy goods are being sent out of the house. Victoria and Mark Schutter, owners of Consignment Furniture Depot in Chamblee, have noticed their younger clients casting away traditional furniture inherited from their parents that does not spark joy. A generation obsessed with minimalist style has no use for china cabinets and other traditional furnishings that once commanded top dollar in their store. Those items are now mostly fodder for the set designers of local filming productions, Mark Schutter said.
At Queenie's Consignment in Decatur, the Kon-Mari madness has worked in favor of shoppers seeking high-end accessories. If that David Yurman jewelry isn't sparking joy, it still has to go, and KonMarid women are giving it up, said owner Vickie Bracewell. On a recent afternoon, one consignor brought in a beautiful silk Chanel scarf to consign. "She said it wasn't bringing her joy," Bracewell said. The scarf sold the same day for $250 to someone who was surely joyful to get it for hundreds of dollars less than retail.
Bracewell and her staff are usually able to process drop-offs the same day, but in recent weeks, they have been at least a day behind. They have had to work extra hours to sort through the additional inventory coming into the store. Not only are core consignors bringing in more and higher-quality items, there are more new consignors in February. The increase is unique in that at least half if not more of the new customers are the result of Kondo's Netflix show, Bracewell said.
On a near-daily basis, someone mentions Marie Kondo or says the words "sparking joy." Bracewell got so used to hearing the phrase, she began using a version of it herself -- telling customers, "If it doesn't bring you joy, bring it to Queenie's."

How to Liberate Amazon Workers; A $150,000 salary goes a lot further in Virginia or Tennessee than it would in high-tax New York City.

Texto completo: Progressives are touting Amazon's decision to cancel its plan to build a headquarters in New York as a great victory over "corporate greed," "worker exploitation" and "the richest man in the world." This may well turn out to be a victory for workers, exploited or otherwise, but perhaps not in the way progressives intend. As Amazon disperses its 25,000 employees earning an average of $150,000 annually to other locations, let's take a look at what it could mean for those employees who end up living in regions more capitalist than socialist.
Amazon is proceeding with its previously announced expansion plans for a 25,000-employee headquarters in Arlington, Va., and a 5,000-employee operations center in Nashville, Tenn. As CEO of CKE Restaurants, I moved our company headquarters to the Nashville area from California in 2016, so it's a subject with which I am personally familiar.
Opinion Live Event
Join us on March 4 as WSJ Opinion's Paul Gigot leads a "State of TV News" panel discussion including Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo, CBS's Christy Tanner and "Network" actor Tony Goldwyn. Included in your admission to the event is a ticket to see "Network" on Broadway at a subsequent date.
For Amazon employees, the income-tax benefits can be significant. A single person living in New York City and making $150,000 a year would pay $9,252 in state income tax plus a municipal income tax of $5,379. In Arlington, that same employee would pay only $8,142 in state income tax—$6,489 lower. Tennessee has no income tax, for a saving of $14,631 compared with New York.
And those dollars go further in Virginia or Tennessee. BestPlaces.net has a calculator that compares the cost of living between cities (including taxes). For a single, childless homeowner, the cost of living in Queens—site of the scrapped Amazon New York headquarters—is 4.4% higher than in Arlington and 80.4% higher than in Nashville. To have the same standard of living $150,000 would in Arlington would take $156,628 in Queens. The equivalent of $150,000 in Nashville is $270,580 in Queens.
Across the East River in Manhattan, the cost of living is 51.8% higher than in Arlington and 173.1% higher than in Nashville. Thus the equivalent of $150,000 in Arlington and Nashville, respectively, is $227,700 and $409,710.
Both Virginia and Tennessee pride themselves on being business-friendly. Amazon is familiar with governments that are less friendly from its headquarters in Seattle, one of the most progressive U.S. cities. Last May, Seattle's City Council unanimously passed a $275-an-employee tax on businesses making more than $20 million a year. Amazon vigorously opposed the tax, and the City Council repealed it, to the chagrin of progressives across the country. The New York Times called it "a warning to cities bidding for the retailer's second headquarters that the company would go to the limit to get its way." Apparently, New York didn't get that message. There's no danger of that in Arlington or Nashville.
Unions were also an issue for Amazon's New York site. Under the National Labor Relations Act, workers have a well-established federal right to unionize and, within limits, employers can oppose unionization. No matter where Amazon locates, the employees have the right to unionize if they so choose.
The problem for unions is that their popularity is waning. Private-sector union membership stood at 16.8% in 1983 when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the data. It has steadily declined to a record low of 6.4% in 2018.
With this decline, the unions have resorted to using their political power to hobble business resistance to unionization. The day before Amazon withdrew its plan for a corporate headquarters in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo held a meeting between Amazon executives and labor leaders to negotiate—in effect, to limit—how aggressively Amazon would urge its employees to resist unionizing. The next day, Amazon announced that it was abandoning it plans for New York.
Again, there is little chance of a union dust-up in business-friendly Virginia or Tennessee. Both are right-to-work states, meaning even if a majority of employees vote to unionize, every worker is free not to join the union. Not many private-sector employees choose to join unions in either state. In both Tennessee and Virginia, only 3.2% of private-sector workers belong to unions. In New York state, the figure is 13.2%.
Given the substantial tax and cost-of-living benefits that come from living in states with capitalist free-market policies like Virginia and Tennessee, it could well be that workers don't see the need for unions. They might even be afraid that progressives and their union allies could drive businesses like Amazon, and their good paying jobs, out of the state. I wonder where they got that idea?

Texto completo: Peace talks between the Taliban and the U.S. have brought back memories of the negotiations that led to the end of America's war in Vietnam. They're also reminiscent of an earlier effort by the U.S. to bring about a peace deal in Asia—specifically, in China after World War II. That effort ended in complete failure.
The U.S. goal in China was to save a pro-American ally, the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, from being overthrown by Mao Zedong's communists. The Truman administration didn't want to go to war to save the Nationalists, so it turned to diplomacy—pretending neutrality and dispatching Gen. George C. Marshall to broker a deal to produce a democratic coalition government.
Today's Afghan government bears disconcerting similarities to the Chinese Nationalists. It is preferred by the U.S. but appears unable to survive without American military support. The Taliban, like the Maoists, are determined and fanatically ideological.
The U.S. effort in China began on Aug. 27, 1945, two weeks after the Japanese surrender, when American Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley escorted Mao to China's wartime capital of Chungking for talks with Chiang aimed at averting the threatened civil war. From Hurley's point of view, things got off to a promising start. After five weeks of talks with Chiang, Mao proclaimed his own wish to "stop [the] civil war" and "unite under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to build modern China."
Mao didn't mean it. As soon as he returned to his headquarters in China's northwest, he assured colleagues that what he'd said in Chungking was "words" with nothing to do with "reality." Mao was following a strategy that Marshall's chief interlocutor, Zhou Enlai, summed up in the phrase "talk talk fight fight."
Mao and his men made all the right gestures to deter the U.S. from increasing support of Chiang. Zhou made a show of what Marshall called the communists' "desire . . . for the establishment of a coalition government." The communists assured American diplomats and journalists, with whom they cultivated warm relationships, of their admiration for American democracy and their disavowal of Soviet-style dictatorship. Talk talk.
Fight fight: At the same time, the communists mounted guerrilla attacks against U.S. Marines stationed in China, killing 13 in an implicit warning to the U.S. of the cost if it interfered on Chiang's side in a civil war. For all his faults, Chiang understood—as many American diplomats and journalists didn't—that the communists' unalterable objective was to use their army to achieve complete power in China and then to effect a revolutionary transformation of Chinese society. That's exactly what they did after they came to power in 1949, dropping the pretense that they admired democracy.
Is the Taliban also playing talk talk fight fight? The main question is whether it would really share power with the Kabul government—the only favorable outcome the negotiations could produce. Will they really, as they're promising, respect the rights of girls and women? Or is that just talk? Given their past ruthlessness and determination, there would seem to be little reason to doubt that the Taliban are driven by ideological zeal and a thirst for power, as the Chinese communists were.
Is the Taliban's goal to induce the U.S. to withdraw its remaining troops, and, once that's done, to resume its bitter, long-term struggle for total power? It worked for Mao.

Alabama publisher calls for Klan's return

Texto completo: The editor of a small-town Alabama newspaper published an editorial calling for "the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again" against "Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats (who) are plotting to raise taxes in Alabama."
Goodloe Sutton, who is the publisher of the Democrat-Reporter newspaper in Linden, confirmed to the Montgomery Advertiser on Monday that he authored the Feb. 14 editorial calling for the return of a white supremacist hate group.
"If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D.C., we'd all been better off," Sutton said.
Asked to elaborate what he meant by "cleaning up D.C.," Sutton suggested lynching.
"We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them," Sutton said.
When asked if he felt it was appropriate for the publisher of a newspaper to call for the lynching of Americans, Sutton doubled down on his position.
"... It's not calling for the lynchings of Americans. These are socialist-communists we're talking about. Do you know what socialism and communism is?" Sutton said.
In the newspaper editorial, Sutton wrote:
Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats are plotting to raise taxes in Alabama. They do not understand how to eliminate expenses when money is needed in other areas. This socialist-communist ideology sounds good to the ignorant, the uneducated and the simple-minded people.
When asked if he recognized the KKK as a racist and violent organization, Sutton disagreed, comparing the Klan to the NAACP.
"A violent organization? Well, they didn't kill but a few people," Sutton said. "The Klan wasn't violent until they needed to be."
Sutton, 79, said he didn't know any Klan remaining in the area, stating most died out after the 1960s.
The editor said he welcomed people to call him, write him a letter or boycott him.
Sutton was in the Democrat-Reporter newsroom on Tuesday, a small white building with a newspaper box out front. Stacks of the weekly newspaper, sold individually for $1, were piled on the front counter.
Sutton declined to speak to an Advertiser reporter, stating he was too busy to talk on Tuesday but could meet later in the week.
Sutton, who has worked at the paper since 1964, inherited the publication from his father. Sutton and the newspaper received national acclaim in the 1990s for their reporting on a corrupt local sheriff. Sutton and his wife, Jane, reported a series of stories of misused funds and abuse of power.
The New York Times in 1998 reported Sutton and the Democrat-Reporter lost advertising dollars and subscribers over their reporting.
In 2007, Sutton was inducted into the University of Southern Mississippi's School of Communication Hall of Fame for the couple's anti-corruption articles and editorials.
After the Advertiser reported on Sutton's recent editorial and comments, the university removed him from the Hall of Fame.
"Within the last few hours, the School of Communication at the University of Southern Mississippi learned of Mr. Goodloe Sutton's call for violence and the return of the Ku Klux Klan," a USM release stated. "Mr. Sutton's subsequent rebuttals and attempts at clarification only reaffirm the misguided and dangerous nature of his comments. The School of Communication strongly condemns Mr. Sutton's remarks as they are antithetical to all that we value as scholars of journalism, the media, and human communication. Our University's values of social responsibility and citizenship, inclusion and diversity, and integrity and civility are the foundation upon which we have built our School and its programs."
Locals in west Alabama say the Democrat-Reporter has a history of inflammatory, racist and offensive language on the editorial page. A review of archived print editions reveal headlines such as "Homosexuals take black spotlight" and an editorial which stated "Slavery was a good lesson for Jews."
In 2015, the paper ran a headline titled: "Selma black thugs murder Demopolite Saturday night." At that time, the paper had about 3,000 subscribers.
The paper also regularly republishes what appear to old editorials from the 1930s and 1940s, which include multiple instances of racist slurs.
Justin Coleman, a 38-year-old who calls the Linden and Demopolis area home, said the Democrat-Reporter has "called for violence against minorities for years."
"It has gone unchecked for decades," said Coleman, who is African-American.
Coleman said people in the community have "become numb" to the weekly newspaper. But he's frustrated by the idea that outsiders might have of Marengo County, which was about 51 percent black and 46 percent white, according to 2018 U.S. Census numbers.
Linden is located about 100 miles due west of Montgomery near the Mississippi border, deep in the rural Alabama Black Belt.
"People usually say we don't know any better, we're country bumpkins," Coleman said. "And if you're black and live here, people think you don't have a problem with racism. Otherwise, they say you should just move."
Coleman, born and raised in the area, owns a barber shop and has no plans to leave. He said it's not uncommon for customers in his barber shop to discuss the latest Sutton editorial, and some people think he's "trolling." But Coleman said whether the editor is truly calling for violence or simply trying to stir up trouble, the behavior needs to be "called out."
"It's different now because of the climate we're in," Coleman said. "He's calling for that against politicians or D.C., and I would hate for something to morph out of that. You can't come back from that."
Chip Brownlee and Mikayla Burns — editor-in-chief and managing editor, respectively, at The Auburn Plainsman — first spotted Sutton's editorial and shared it online Monday. Brownlee on Monday published a review of of past Democrat-Reporter articles in the Alabama Political Reporter.
"As a newspaper editor myself it's disturbing to see this type of editorial printed," Brownlee said via email. "Granted, I'm the editor of a student newspaper, but all newspapers should be held to the highest ethical and moral standards. Editorials should be about new ideas, constructive criticism and opinion backed up by facts. To call for the return of domestic terrorism — no matter its form — is counterproductive and wrong. It's important to welcome and encourage differing opinions, but violence is never right."
The Alabama Press Association on Tuesday suspended The Democrat-Reporter pending further action, the trade association said in an emailed statement.
"The Alabama Press Association Board of Directors voted today to censure Goodloe Sutton and suspend the association membership of The Democrat-Reporter. The members have a right under the bylaws to address the question of expulsion of the newspaper at our next membership meeting."

Germany Reports
Large Trade Surplus
Germany's current-account surplus was the world's largest for the third year in a row in 2018, confirming deep imbalances in the global economy that have drawn ire from the Trump administration and helped justify U.S. efforts to reset global trade rules.
The data come at an awkward time for European officials, who are negotiating a new trade agreement with the U.S.
Since his election, President Trump has warned he might impose a 25% tariff on European car imports if the negotiations don't bear fruit.
Germany's current-account surplus, a measure of excess savings in the economy, was $294 billion in 2018, or 7.4% of economic output, think tank Ifo said.
That puts Germany ahead of Japan, with a $173 billion surplus. Russia came third with $116 billion. China fell out of the top three due to increased imports of machinery.

Authorities denied entry to a New York Times journalist, detaining him at Cairo's international airport before putting him on a flight to London, amid a government clampdown on the media.
David D. Kirkpatrick, a former Cairo bureau chief for the newspaper, was detained at the airport for seven hours without explanation, the Times said. Mr. Kirkpatrick declined to comment.
Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt's State Information Service, said he had no information about the incident.
The U.S. said it has raised concerns with Egyptian officials.
President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi has presided over a crackdown on press freedom. Egypt leads the world in the number of journalists held on charges of so-called false or fake news, according to advocacy group the Committee to Protect Journalists.

To Lose Citizenship
Shamima Begum, a London teenager who left Britain four years ago to join Islamic State, is to be stripped of her U.K. citizenship by the government, her family's lawyer said. Attorney Tasnime Akunjee tweeted that the family is "considering all legal avenues to challenge this decision."
ITV News reported the family received a letter from the Home Office, which oversees immigration, saying the order revoking Ms. Begum's citizenship had been made. The letter said she could appeal the decision.
Ms. Begum left London with two friends in 2015, when she was 15, traveled to Syria and married an Islamic State fighter. Now 19 and living in a refugee camp, she has given birth to a baby and wants to come home.
In interviews, she has criticized some aspects of Islamic State but said she does not regret going there.

Clarence Thomas Urges Easing Standards for Suing News Organizations; Supreme Court Justice conveys skepticism of rules set down under landmark 1964 press-freedom ruling

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Justice Clarence Thomas issued a solo opinion Tuesday urging his colleagues on the Supreme Court to consider making it easier for public figures to sue news organizations.
Justice Thomas made his argument in an opinion that, technically, agreed with the court in refusing to consider reinstating a defamation suit against Bill Cosby, the comedian convicted last year of sex crimes. A woman who publicly accused Mr. Cosby of rape, Kathrine McKee, sued Mr. Cosby after his attorney allegedly sent and leaked a confidential letter to a newspaper disputing her credibility.
Lower courts dismissed the suit, holding that Ms. McKee, having injected herself into a public debate, had to meet a higher burden to demonstrate her injury. The Supreme Court laid out that standard in 1964, when it unanimously threw out a $500,000 award a Montgomery, Ala., commissioner had won in state court against the New York Times.
The newspaper had published an advertisement paid for by the Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South. Although the ad didn't name the commissioner, the commissioner contended readers would infer it blamed him for the "wave of terror" local authorities had unleashed against civil-rights activists. The Alabama court based its award on several factual errors in the ad, such as an assertion that black students protesting at the state capitol had sung "My Country 'Tis of Thee" when in fact it had been "The Star-Spangled Banner."
On Tuesday, Justice Thomas agreed that the 1964 decision, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, correctly dismissed the suit against the newspaper. But he complained that the opinion went astray by issuing rules for lower courts in assessing defamation lawsuits. Public figures, such as the Alabama commissioner, would have to prove the defendant's "actual malice"—that is, it made the defamatory claims knowing they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth.
Writing for the court in 1964, Justice William Brennan said the First Amendment reflected "a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."
Justice Thomas, however, said Tuesday that officials and other public figures had great leeway to sue publications when the First Amendment was ratified in 1791 and suggested that they should enjoy the same privilege today.
"Far from increasing a public figure's burden in a defamation action, the common law deemed libels against public figures to be, if anything, more serious and injurious than ordinary libels," Justice Thomas wrote, because they undermined confidence in government authority.
The precedent Justice Thomas challenged "gives the press wide flexibility to comment on and criticize people in power. Since 1964, Times v. Sullivan has become part of our fabric, not only in First Amendment law, but American democratic principles," said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University.
President Trump frequently has complained that constitutional standards make it too hard to sue news organizations, but some scholars have noted that the high bar for First Amendment lawsuits may help protect Mr. Trump from liability for some of his own provocative remarks.
No other justice joined Justice Thomas's opinion.
Justice Thomas has taken several positions at odds with Supreme Court precedent that have found little support among his colleagues. In 2014 , he suggested that under the original understanding of another First Amendment clause, prohibiting an establishment of religion, states could create their own official churches.

Texto completo: CAIRO—Egyptian authorities denied entry to a New York Times journalist, detaining him at Cairo's international airport before putting him on a flight back to London early Tuesday, an unexplained move amid a government clampdown on the media.
David D. Kirkpatrick, a former bureau chief for the New York Times in Cairo, was detained at the airport for seven hours without an explanation, the newspaper said. Mr. Kirkpatrick declined to comment.
Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt's State Information Service, said he had no information about why Mr. Kirkpatrick was detained and turned away.
"We have dozens of cases in which authorities in the United States, in which British authorities, French authorities, German authorities refused journalists or citizens to their lands. It's a right of any state," Mr. Rashwan said.
The U.S. raised concerns with Egyptian officials, said Sam Werberg, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. "We're concerned about reports of the unexplained refusal of entry to Egypt of a U.S. citizen New York Times journalist," he said.
President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, a former general who came to power after the military ousted an elected government in 2013, has presided over a crackdown on Egypt's press freedom.
Since the military takeover, authorities have shut down news organizations and blocked about 500 websites including those of independent media, as the government attempts to prevent a repeat of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak.
With at least 25 journalists behind bars, Egypt is the third-largest jailer of media workers in the world, trailing China and Turkey, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a leading advocacy group in New York.
Egypt leads the world in the number of journalists imprisoned on charges of so-called false or fake news, according to CPJ.
Michael Slackman, international editor for the New York Times, placed the incident in the context of threats to press freedom around the world.
"This is a disturbing development. We have correspondents in many places facing pressure from authoritarian governments, but Egypt is a country where we have operated for well over half a century without this kind of restriction," said Mr. Slackman in an email to staff that he forwarded to The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Kirkpatrick, 48 years old, was based in Cairo from 2011 to 2015. He covered the revolution that toppled former President Mubarak in 2011 and the military coup that removed President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. He is the author of a book about Egypt's post-revolutionary turmoil.
Egyptian officials frequently criticized Mr. Kirkpatrick's coverage, which included investigations of the war on Islamic State in the Sinai Peninsula and coverage of Egypt's crackdown on political opponents.
Mr. Kirkpatrick is now based in London. The New York Times didn't say why he was traveling to Egypt or what if any visa he had been issued.
The development comes roughly a year after Egyptian authorities expelled Bel Trew, a British journalist for the Times of London after detaining her following an interview in Cairo. Ms. Trew was one of the most established foreign reporters based in Egypt.
Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abou Zeid, known as Shawkan, has been imprisoned for more than five years after being arrested while documenting a lethal police crackdown on protesters in 2013.
Mr. Abou Zeid was slated to be released in September 2018 but continues to be held without explanation. According to his family, he was transferred to a police station this week before his possible release.

In Kashmir, Militants Kill At Least 4 Indian Soldiers

Texto completo: NEW DELHI -- Militants in Kashmir struck again on Monday, killing an Indian Army major and at least three other soldiers just days after orchestrating a devastating bombing that left dozens of Indian security forces dead.
Fears are now rising that Kashmir, a disputed region that lies between India and its regional rival, Pakistan, could be sliding into an especially deadly phase again.
Diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan are breaking down; Kashmiri students are being rounded up and attacked; other young people have been charged with sedition for criticizing the Indian Army; and Indians are lashing out at Pakistani civilians, including Bollywood actors.
The recent violence in Kashmir -- a majority Muslim region that is mostly controlled by India, a predominantly Hindu nation -- has uncapped a wave of jingoism that is sweeping across India. The orange, white and green national flag is going up everywhere, and many people say they want revenge.
Pakistan has a long history of supporting militant groups in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir. India has accused Pakistan of orchestrating the recent violence and vowed to retaliate. But India has few good military options, analysts say -- and the public seems to sense this.
"There is a real sense of frustration and anger because Pakistan is in the picture," said Gurcharan Das, an Indian writer. "A lot of Indians feel that India has failed with regard to Pakistan and that it has not been tough enough and has appeased Pakistan."
"But," he added, "I don't think anybody really wants a war."
The trouble on Monday started around 2 a.m. Under the cover of darkness, Indian soldiers in the Pulwama District of the Kashmir Valley surrounded a house that was thought to be a militant hide-out.
The militants opened fire on the approaching contingent, killing a major and three soldiers and critically wounding at least one other soldier. At least one civilian was killed in the crossfire.
Indian officials said the militants inside the house were members of Jaish-e-Muhammad, or the Army of Muhammad, the separatist group that claimed responsibility for the bombing last week that killed at least 40 Indian soldiers -- one of the deadliest attacks in the region in decades.
By midafternoon, Indian officials said two militants had been killed. But security forces were struggling to get closer to the house because hundreds of Kashmiri civilians were hurling rocks in an effort to shield the militants, who are widely seen in Kashmir as legitimate freedom fighters.
Pakistan has denied involvement in the recent bombing in Kashmir, for which Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has promised "a befitting reply."
Retaliation would carry huge risks, however. Both nations field nuclear arsenals, and regional dynamics are especially sensitive right now. United States officials have been calling on regional powers to support a peace plan for an American withdrawal from Afghanistan, where Pakistan has long been a powerful influence.
But India is headed into major elections in the next few months, and Mr. Modi hardly wants to look weak.
Pakistan's security services have a long history of supporting Kashmiri separatists and other militant groups, often using them as a proxy force against India. The United States considers the Army of Muhammad a terrorist organization; the group is officially banned in Pakistan, but Indian and American officials say it still operates there under different names.
The status of Kashmir has been disputed for decades, with India and Pakistan claiming large chunks of the mountainous region. Many of the militants in Kashmir are young men who have spent their entire lives in the Indian-controlled areas and have been shaped by years of heavy occupation by Indian troops. Security analysts say many militants still receive money and weapons from Pakistan.
On Thursday, a Kashmiri militant slammed a truck containing an unusually powerful bomb into a convoy of Indian troops moving across the Kashmir Valley. More than 40 paramilitary officers were killed, and Indian officials say they believe the bomb maker slipped in from Pakistan.
Since then, Indian security forces have been searching for accomplices, often going house to house.
Kashmiri civilians are also being targeted. At a university in Dehradun, someone used WhatsApp to threaten Kashmiri students, saying: "We will not leave you alive."
A board outside a mobile phone shop read: "Dogs are allowed, but Kashmiris are not allowed."
Witnesses said that mobs swept through Dehradun, beating up Kashmiri students and forcing scores to flee.
"I am very scared," said Junaid Ayub Rather, an engineering student who managed to hire a car to leave Dehradun.
He cited years of conflict and misery in Kashmir, where tens of thousands of civilians have been killed over the decades as India, Pakistan and various militant groups have fought for control.
"Tell me," Mr. Rather said, "have you ever heard of Kashmiris attacking or threatening civilians from other parts of the country who reside in Kashmir to avenge that?"
Diplomatically, the two countries are pulling apart. On Friday, India recalled its ambassador to Pakistan. On Monday, Pakistan did the same.
Across India, more than a dozen people have been arrested, lost their jobs or were expelled from school for writing social media posts that were seen as critical of the Indian military or interpreted by the authorities as siding with the attackers.
Surabhi Singh, a senior coordinator for the Center for Advocacy and Research, a nonprofit that works with marginalized communities, wrote a post on Facebook shortly after the bombing, criticizing the Indian Army's record.
She wrote: "If Attack on Armed Soldiers is Cowardly ... Attacking Unarmed Civilians including Hapless Children must be an Act of Bravery."
Over the weekend, she was fired.
"I was targeted," said Ms. Singh, who has also worked as a translator for international news organizations, including The New York Times. "You're not allowed to think freely anymore. You have to toe the line of the majority. It is jingoistic."
Even actors are being punished. A number of Indian film organizations announced a boycott of Pakistani actors working in India's film industry, by far the biggest in South Asia.
Suresh Shyamlal Gupta, the president of the All Indian Cine Workers Association, said India needed to attack Pakistan "from all sides."

Texto completo: "Brayden's so excited that he has that number. He's so proud
to give it out."
Krista Eckel
Whose son now has the phone number that once belonged
to his late father
When someone dies, the physical items they leave behind can hold a kind of magic for their loved ones — glasses, an old car, worn shoes. But what about something as intangible as a phone number?
This story begins on June 30, 2013, when 19 wildland firefighters died fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire.
And the story continues now, with Fernanda Santos, Debbie Mazzella and Krista Eckel, all sitting together at Krista's home in Paulden.
It's about 65 miles north of where Krista's first husband, Travis, was overrun by flames, along with all but one of the Granite Mountain Hotshots.
The next morning, she had to tell her 6-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter their dad wasn't coming home.
"That's probably the part that gets me the most, to this day," Krista said, crying and breathing hard. "I can talk about all of it, but as a mother, you carry that burden more for your kids than you do for yourself."
Everyone in this room knows that pain. When Debbie's first husband, Jay, died 15 years ago, she also had two children. She's now married to a firefighter in the same region. He's the one who told her about the deaths of the Granite Mountain Hotshots.
"I'll never forget. I was on the side of my bed, and I fell to my knees," she said, "and I just started praying for the families."
Not long after, Fernanda became close with many of those families. Back then, she was a Phoenix-based writer for the New York Times. So many people connected to the tragedy trusted her with their stories, which she poured into articles — then into a book.
"And then my husband died," she said. "So, Mike died Nov. 1, 2017."
It was just a month after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Their daughter, Flora, was 8.
"I felt like nobody, even the people who meant really well, didn't really understand," she said.
Except there were some who did: the firefighters' families. Fernanda had kept in touch, and on a hot day this August, she was invited to a barbecue in Prescott at one of their homes. That's where she finally met Krista, the hotshot widow, who'd mostly steered clear of media in the past.
"And then we started talking," Fernanda said.
They talked about all kinds of things, including the financial reality of being widowed. Krista had canceled her late husband's cellphone. Fernanda had, too, but told Krista she was paying $5 a month to preserve the number, so her daughter could use it someday.
"And then you were like, 'What?'" Fernanda said, smiling at Krista.
"I know!" Krista replied. "I was shocked. I did not know you could do that."
If Krista had known, she would have saved her husband's number for their son, Brayden, who was now 12 — and begging for a phone. But it was five years too late. So she did the only thing she thought she could. She sent a text message to the number, asking if whoever had it would be willing to give it to her son.
She posted about it on Facebook. And waited.
Debbie replied — and still has the text on her phone. She's the woman who had felt so connected to the hotshots right after the tragedy.
"Perhaps it will be meaningful for your son to know that his dad's number was given to another firefighter's wife all this time and to someone who has prayed to God to mend and heal your broken hearts over these years," Debbie read from her phone. "I would gladly give up my number. Would you allow me a little time to make the arrangements with my carrier?"
Now, a few months later, Krista says she doesn't think words can describe the difference those few digits have made to her son.
"Brayden's so excited that he has that number. He's so proud to give it out," she said. "'That's my dad's old number!' He says that to everybody he gives it to."
He has the number. And now Krista, Debbie and Fernanda have one another — their families, too.
Fernanda cuddled Krista's smiley, cooing 10-month-old daughter, Cheyenne.
"Oh, I love babies," Fernanda said.
It was actually the first time all three women had met in person, after connecting mostly through calls and texts. But they said they're all going to stay in one another's lives.
Debbie, who still cries over her first husband's death 15 years ago, leaned in close to Fernanda.
"You will survive this," she said, in a hushed, comforting tone, "and it doesn't feel like it all the time."
"No," Fernanda said.
But all three know it's true. They also know how important it is to keep to the memories alive of the men they've lost. Friends and acquaintances will often avoid talking about their late husbands.
Don't do that, these women say. Instead, say the names.
"Jay Mianecki," said Debbie.
"Mike Saucier," said Fernanda.
"Travis Carter," said Krista.
Then, in tears, they embraced, each hugging a woman who understands.

Lee Radziwill dies at 85

Texto completo: Socialite and fashion icon Lee Radziwill, the stylish younger sister of the late First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died in her Manhattan home at the age of 85.
No other details were released about the Friday death of the globe-trotting Radziwill (photo), whose coterie of friends included Truman Capote, Rudolf Nureyev, Leonard Bernstein and Andy Warhol.
The ever-elegant Radziwill's fashion sense was best illustrated by her work as an interior decorator and her time spent in a variety of positions working for Giorgio Armani.
"We are heartbroken and I will miss our dear friend," tweeted fashion designer Tory Burch, an unabashed admirer. "Rest in Peace, Lee Radziwill."
She was a 1996 inductee to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame. And Radziwill released two books of photos depicting her world travels, tony homes and famous friends.
"She was the height of elegance, a true icon - an incredibly attractive woman who always adapted to whatever the circumstance," Mathilde Favier, public relations director in charge of VIPs at Christian Dior, told WWD.
"She was never overdressed or underdressed. . . . She was incredibly elegant and inspiring, and always ahead of her time because she was a fashion visionary. It's very sad. It's the end of an era."
Caroline Lee Radziwill was considered the "the pretty one" and her sister Jackie "the smart one" as the two were growing up. In her memoir "Happy Times," Radziwill recounted her childhood admiration for her older sibling.
With the 1961 arrival of President John F. Kennedy in the White House, Jackie and Lee reigned as the world's best-known sisters - America's new "It Girls."
She was married three times, with her wedding to Polish aristocrat Prince Stanislaw Albrecht Radziwill turning Radziwill into a temporary princess and a mother of two. Their 1959 marriage came between her unions with publishing executive Michael Canfield in 1953 and film director Herbert Ross in 1988.
The first marriage was annulled, and the latter two ended in divorce.
Her sister Jackie passed away at age 64 in 1994, and her son Anthony died of cancer in 1999 - barely a month after the plane crash death of his cousin John F. Kennedy Jr.
In a 2013 interview with The New York Times, Radziwill bemoaned the loss of so many people throughout her life.
"When I was young, I used to think that everyone should die at 70," she said. "But my closest friends, like Rudolf and Andy and to an extent Capote, let along most of my close family, didn't even reach that age.
"There is something to be said for being older, and memories."

Texto completo: Journalists shadowed 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris on Saturday as she shopped for clothes while touring local businesses in Columbia, S.C. — generating a debate among media members about the appropriate proximity to candidates during campaign coverage.

Among the reporters with Harris, the California senator, as she visited women-owned small businesses were Caitlin Huey-Burns of CBS News, CNN’s Maeve Reston, and Melanie Mason of the Los Angeles Times.

In a short video posted to Twitter, Huey-Burns indicated that Reston picked out a jacket for Harris to try on.

Mason, in her own tweet, said Harris bought the coat.

Conservative commentators accused the reporters of engaging too closely with Harris, among a swath of progressive Democrats in the primary fight for the right to challenge President Trump in November 2020.

“This is just embarrassing,” said Brit Hune, Fox News senior political analyst, in a Twitter post. “So now journalists are going shopping with Harris, helping pick out clothes and then putting out glowing tweets about it.”

Fellow campaign reporters, however, defended the journalists, arguing the interaction was a welcome contract to recent presidential campaigns that have not provided reporters sufficient access.

“I took it as a hopeful sign that her handlers aren’t shielding her and are offering the sort of access recent pres campaigns (R and D) have not,” Jonathan Martin of the New York Times wrote on Twitter. “As you know, this was once much more commonplace. And I don’t think it precludes skeptical coverage.”

AJC SEPIA BLACK HISTORY MONTH: Billie Holiday: The unforgettable Lady Day had rough youth: Born to teen parents, singer became one of the most famous in jazz.

Texto completo: The gutsy Billie Holiday, fondly remembered as Lady Day, would have been 104 years old come April. Her discernible voice -- sultry, mellow and strikingly melancholy -- earned the "Strange Fruit" singer an indelible posthumous legacy.
Born Eleanora Fagan to a pair of poverty-stricken teenagers, her personal life was plagued with tragedy and scandal from the very start.
Her stage name, Billie Holiday, was a tribute to movie star Billie Dove and her father, jazz guitarist Clarence Holiday, who was only 15 when his daughter came into the world on April 7, 1915. Her mom, Sadie Fagan, was 13. The union didn't last long.
Growing up, Holiday would run errands for a Baltimore brothel in exchange for a chance to listen to jazz icons Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith, two legends who inspired her most. But it was ultimately desperation -- not desire -- that led Holiday to song, according to her obituary in The New York Times.
Upon moving to New York, her mom fell into a debilitating depression and was unable to find work. A teenage Holiday went down to Harlem "looking for any kind of work," the Times reported.
Both mother and daughter had ultimately turned to prostitution.
After a stint in prison for solicitation, Holiday landed her first singing gig at Harlem's Jerry Preston's Log Cabin, where the amateur had been turned down as a dancer. For $2 a night, six nights a week, you could hear Holiday serenade audiences with "Trav'lin All Alone" or "Body and Soul."
In 1933, she entered the studio to sing "Your Mother's Son-in-Law" with Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa, Joe Sullivan and Benny Goodman, who had heard of her talents through producer John Hammond.
Her time with the group catapulted her to fame as Lady Day, a nickname later given to her by Count Basie tenor saxophonist Lester Young.
With her head tilted back and white gardenias in her hair, Holiday's famous 1939 performance at New York's Café Society introduced the world to two of her most renowned songs, "God Bless the Child" and "Strange Fruit," the latter of which left witnesses stunned then -- and still resonates with many today.
Ahmet Ertegun, the legendary record producer, called the song, which Holiday first sang 16 years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus, "a declaration of war the beginning of the civil rights movement," Times critic David Margolick wrote in 2000.
Written by Jewish poet Abel Meeropol (pseudonym Lewis Allan), "Strange Fruit" was a protest song about lynching, "the first to shoulder an explicit political message into the arena of entertainment," The Guardian reported in 2011. But "it was not, by any stretch, a song for every occasion. It infected the air in the room, cut conversation stone dead, left drinks untouched, cigarettes unlit. Customers either clapped till their hands were sore, or walked out in disgust."
The biting depiction, further haunted by Holiday's vulnerable performance and the measured cadence of her finger snaps, came at a time when lynching was on the decline in the country but still common in the South.
When she'd sing "Strange Fruit," she said she always thought of her father, who died at age 39 after being denied treatment at a "whites only" hospital in Texas, according to her 1956 autobiography, "Lady Sings the Blues." While touring in the South, she was banned from sitting with white vocalists and was asked to use a hotel's freight elevator so as not to offend white clientele.
"Political songs legendarily age poorly, yet even with listeners desensitized to 'Strange Fruit,' the song has acquired a painful and unwanted freshness in the age of Walter Scott and Eric Garner," The Atlantic wrote in 2015.
Holiday's rise to fame in a world still ripe with racism further crumbled with her own growing battle with heroin. She was arrested for a narcotics violation in 1947, a conviction that kept her from retaining the cabaret license required to perform in New York's nightclubs. Her entanglements with a series of abusive men and inescapable drug and alcohol abuse through the 1950s exacerbated the fall. Self-destruction eventually stole the luster from Holiday's hardening voice.
On July 17, 1959, Holiday was arrested and handcuffed for drug possession as she lay dying of pulmonary edema and heart failure at New York's Metropolitan Hospital. She was 44 years old. Her last album, "Recording," was released just four months before her death. At the end of her short life, Holiday had just 70 cents in her bank account, and most of her recordings were out of print.
More than half a century later, you can find them all. With a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Grammy to her name, spots on both the Grammy and the Rock and Roll Halls of Fame and much more acclaim associated with her work, Lady Day's enduring legacy lives on.

Amazon Fiasco Splits New York's Left; Not every city Democrat is an antibusiness progressive like Bill de Blasio and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Texto completo: From 30,000 feet, Amazon's abandonment of its proposed new headquarters in New York City might seem a chance, as Bostonian snobs like to put it, for the light to dawn on Marblehead.
Slathering on tax abatements and infrastructure promises to lure new development may be irresistible for communities, but is always a second-best idea. For New York it was especially unnecessary given all the city's attractions. The city would be better off giving all businesses a tax cut.
But the eagerness of certain progressives to celebrate the loss of Amazon jobs as a triumph of "the people" is a chance to see things in new light.
One newly enlightened resident of Marblehead, since retiring his 2020 presidential hopes, is Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Unlike some of his allies, Mr. Cuomo hasn't been backpaddling to get on the right side of the left after the Amazon fiasco.
Compare this to Mayor Bill de Blasio, as much an architect of the Amazon deal as Mr. Cuomo was. Now he says: "We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world. Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity."
Here Mr. de Blasio echoes an emergency talking point adopted by many liberals last seen mau-mauing the company for accepting a deal proffered by liberals. Suddenly they're not so sure they want credit for the forfeited jobs and tax revenues. Solution: Blame the company for letting their over-the-top rhetoric drive it away.
Do they have half a point? Maybe. Amazon obviously holds to a mind-set native to much of America: A deal is a deal. A handshake settles matters. It's not a signal for a new negotiation, complete with vilification of Amazon for agreeing to the terms you just put before it.
But New York is New York. It would have meant overcoming some bad blood but Jeff Bezos could have done worse than consult a certain Donald Trump, an expert in New York-style bargaining who has been through the rigadoon many times with the city himself.
He might have advised Mr. Bezos: Put on a plastic grin. Let the ninnies have their shriek. Hey, there's no such thing as bad press in New York. And be open to some adjustment here and there, for which you can expect to receive down-low compensation in the future once the storm has passed.
Mr. Bezos might have been wise to entertain such advice since he's in danger of dominating the news lately in more ways than are desirable. But then we'd be missing something salutary: an explosion of genuine and vociferous debate among Democrats in one-party New York. It almost sounds like democracy coming alive.
If there's a downturn between now and 2020, possibly even the U.S. Congress might have to do without the services of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now bragging about her success in killing Amazon jobs. How she became the representative of a community that needs opportunity and economic development more than it needs campus lefty attitudinizing was always a bit of a mystery. Except for her ethnic background, she doesn't fit the district that propelled her to overnight stardom. I bet many of the area's residents, as they assess what her latest coup has cost them, are starting to feel the same way.
Our strange new respect for Mr. Cuomo has it limits, but he has allowed himself lately to notice that New York state's high taxes are a deterrent to business. They drive high-earning taxpayers away. He finds it convenient to blame Mr. Trump for accentuating the problem by limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes. But being able to shift some of the cost of New York's punitive tax rates to other states hardly proved a solution to upstate's long economic decline.
In a pungent statement on the governor's own website, Mr. Cuomo not only acknowledged New York's fiscal unattractiveness and the reality of tax competition with other states. He skewered the disingenuous and just plain dumb critics who portrayed his Amazon deal as a net giveaway when Amazon would have brought New York $9 in tax revenues for every $1 in tax relief it enjoyed.
The governor especially unloaded on the New York Times, which has its own sterling history of extorting tax breaks and zoning exceptions from the city and state.
The world would be a better place, and New York would do better by its long-suffering job creators, if it spent less time dishing out favors to a handful of big-name companies. Political capital could be more intelligently employed making the state and city hospitable to businesses of all kinds, especially the smaller businesses that create most jobs.
You could possibly even have that debate once you thin out a political class for which progressive sloganeering is a weightier reality than the jobs and incomes and personal welfare of millions of citizens.

Texto completo: At the start of the crowded Democratic 2020 primary campaign, the biggest election issue for some candidates may be an elocution issue. The presidential hopefuls are trying to get voters to learn how to pronounce their names.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is often called "Kristen." Another candidate with a complicated name—Pete Buttigieg—asks voters to simply refer to him as "Mayor Pete."
On the "Tom Joyner Morning Show" last week, journalist Roland S. Martin opened an interview with California Sen. Kamala Harris with this query: "Is it 'COMMA-la,' or 'KUH-ma-la?' "
"It's 'COMMA-la,'" Ms. Harris replied with a laugh. "Just think of 'calm.' At least I try to be most of the time."
The names of presidential candidates in the past have tended toward the bland and monosyllabic. This year's Democratic field is especially diverse, offering multiple opportunities to mangle the names of the people vying to become the next commander in chief.
Down in Texas, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke hasn't announced a presidential campaign yet , but his childhood nickname—pronounced "BET-oh"—comes up a lot. "Beto" is often used in Mexico, across the border from Mr. O'Rourke's hometown of El Paso, as a nickname for Roberto.
Beto's full name is Robert Francis O'Rourke, which is something his 2018 Republican opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz, wanted voters to know about. Mr. Cruz's campaign produced a radio ad with a country-music-inspired jingle that said Mr. O'Rourke "changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin."
Mr. Cruz, whose full name is Rafael Edward Cruz, narrowly defeated Mr. O'Rourke in the Senate race.
For some, the name game has been a matter of political survival. When Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska ran for re-election as a write-in candidate in 2010, her ads explained to voters how to fill in a write-in ballot and spell her name correctly. Her campaign distributed tens of thousands of rubbery blue wristbands that featured her name, and the senator ended some events by leading the crowd in a spelling lesson—"M-U-R-K-O-W-S-K-I." She won.
Political names also can turn into punch lines. Former House Speaker John Boehner, pronounced "BAY-nur," confessed during a 2017 Reddit "Ask Me Anything" that his German last name should have been pronounced "Boner." He said it didn't carry a derogatory connotation for his ancestors.
"I believe my grandparents were the first ones to change the pronunciation," he said. "But their parents were against the idea because the family had built up the 'Boner' reputation and everybody loved us 'Boners.' "
Ms. Harris, the child of immigrants from Jamaica and India , writes in her recent book, "The Truths We Hold," that her first name means "lotus flower" in Sanskrit. But pronouncing it is hardly a walk in the park. She's been called "Ka-MILLA," "CAM-a-la" and "KUH-ma-la." Donald Trump, in a recent interview with The New York Times, referred to her as "Kameela."
Ms. Gillibrand is facing double jeopardy. Her last name is pronounced "JILL-a-brand," and she launched her campaign last month with a video that features a Google search that initially misspells her first name—"Kristen"—and then the correct version is typed into the search field.
During a stop in Ames, Iowa, last month, state Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell told the crowd at a coffeehouse that she had the "honor today of introducing Senator, uh, Kris-Kirsten Gillibrand."
After a quick rundown of Ms. Gillibrand's résumé, Ms. Wessel-Kroeschell turned over the program to the featured speaker. "Please join me in welcoming, Senator...," Ms. Wessel-Kroeschell said, pausing. "KEER-sten JILL-a-brand," the senator interjected, prompting the crowd to applaud.
Mr. Buttigieg might be able to relate. The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., is a dark-horse candidate for the Democratic nomination. He is a Rhodes Scholar, veteran of the Afghanistan war and openly gay.
His Maltese last name is often the way he breaks the ice. On his Twitter handle, the mayor notes that his last name is pronounced "BOOT-edge-edge," which sometimes gets blended into "BOO-da-jedge."
After explaining that to Iowa voters in December, he resorted to his fallback position: "Just call me Mayor Pete."
Julián Castro is the former U.S. Housing and Urban Development secretary who is vying to become the nation's first Hispanic president. He made an unusual discovery last December when he announced his presidential exploratory committee : He couldn't add an accent mark to his first name online.
So Mr. Castro printed out his paperwork from the Federal Election Commission and added an accent over the "a" with a pen. An identical twin whose brother is a Texas congressman, Mr. Castro has been fielding questions about the pronunciation of his first name—"Who-lee-AHN"—for a while.
In a 2010 interview on "The Colbert Report," he said people often called him by the English-sounding "JOO-lee-in" until he attended Stanford University. Once in college, he embraced his Hispanic background. "From then on, I always referred to myself as Julián, never Julian," he wrote in his 2018 book, "An Unlikely Journey."
Barack Obama, for his part, saw his own unusual name as a potential liability. Some adversaries tried to compound the issue by adding references to his foreign-sounding middle name, Hussein. "When your name is Barack Obama, it's always tight," he joked about election contests during one TV appearance.
With the exception of Mr. Obama, recent presidents have had last names with one or two syllables: Trump, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Carter, Ford and Nixon.
That might not bode so well for John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who has been considering a presidential campaign.
The former Denver mayor and brewpub owner often goes by the same nickname as his father, "Hick," and frequently brings up his name when he talks about his unlikely political story.
In his 2016 book, "The Opposite of Woe: My Life in Beer and Politics," he recalled getting into a dispute with the police department after he was elected mayor. A group of off-duty police officers gathered outside his office and chanted, "Chickenlooper!"
Mr. Hickenlooper wrote that it was "catchy," but he didn't think it was very original. "I'd heard that one quite a bit from kids when I was in elementary school, usually right after 'Poopenscooper' or 'Chickencooper,' " Mr. Hickenlooper wrote, "which, if you ask me, are far more inspired."

Texto completo: The New York Times on Thursday reported that the FBI's New York field office is looking into whether singer/songwriter Ryan Adams committed a crime by sexting with an underage fan.
The allegations are part of a larger story The Times published Wednesday that details Adams' history of championing aspiring female artists and then manipulating and harassing them. In one instance, he is said to have had phone sex and exchanged graphic texts with an underage girl. Seven women and more than a dozen associates were interviewed for the story.
USA TODAY has reached out to the FBI for comment.
"This Is Us" star Mandy Moore says she empathizes with the women who have accused her ex-husband of exploiting and then stifling female artists' ambitions because she experienced it herself during their six-year marriage.
“Music was a point of control for him,” Moore told The Times. “His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time – my entire mid-to-late 20s. " They divorced in 2016.
.
"What you experience with him – the treatment, the destructive, manic sort of back-and-forth behavior – feels so exclusive,” Moore said. “You feel like there’s no way other people have been treated like this. ”
But through the reporting of the Times story, Moore and other women scarred by their relationships with Adams say they have formed a support system and spoken out together in hopes of protecting others.
After the Times story was published Wednesday, Moore posted a message on Instagram about the importance of speaking up.
"Speaking your truth can be painful and triggering but it’s always worth it," she captioned an image of herself used for the Times' story. "My heart is with all women who have suffered any sort of trauma or abuse. You are seen and heard. #sisterhoodforever"
On Thursday, model and musician Karen Elson spoke out about her own experience with Adams, although she didn't offer details.
“I also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams,” she wrote on Instagram.
“While I’m not quite brave enough yet to speak about my specifics. I’m encouraged that many women have bonded and helped each other heal. … The trauma that lingers is often a very powerful silencer of women as is the business that enables these men to thrive without ever facing consequences. ” she added.
Elson, who is also a singer-songwriter, performed as an opening act for Adams on some tour dates in 2017.
Adams, 44, who the Times described as "equal parts punk-rock folk hero and romantic troubadour," comes off as a manipulative boor in the Times' reporting, someone who championed upcoming female artists, especially young ones, and promised career advancement while also pursuing them for sex.
If he didn't get his way, he would sometimes "turn domineering and vengeful, jerking away his offers of support when spurned, and subjecting women to emotional and verbal abuse, and harassment in texts and on social media," the Times reported Wednesday.
Late Wednesday, Adams released a statement through his lawyer, emailed to USA TODAY.
"I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly. But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false.
"I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. Period. "
The Times said the accounts of Adams' alleged behavior were corroborated by family members or friends of the women who were present at the time, as well as by correspondence from Adams reviewed by the paper.

Especially troubling was the accusation that Adams had an inappropriate online relationship with a teenage girl that began with graphic texting and moved on to video calls on Skype where Adams exposed himself during phone sex.
The paper reviewed more than 3,200 texts Adams exchanged with a girl they called Ava, who is now 20 but was 15 and 16 during a nine-month period they had an online relationship. They never met in person.
In the texts, Adams questioned Ava about her age, and she sometimes lied and said she was older than she was. He didn't seem convinced, the paper reported, but their sexual conversations continued. “i would get in trouble if someone knew we talked like this,” Adams wrote to her in November 2014.
A constant theme in their off-and-on exchanges was fretting about her age, mixed with explicit talk about his desire to touch her body parts, the Times reported.
Adams is denying these accusations, according to his lawyer, Andrew Brettler, a member of a major celebrity legal firm in Los Angeles. Brettler told the Times the singer did not recall these exchanges with Ava, and if she had been underage, he didn't know it.
“Mr. Adams unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage,” Brettler said.
The Times said laws covering sexually explicit communication with a minor vary from state to state and are separate from age-of-consent laws, which involve physical contact.
In Ohio, where Ava lived, it’s a felony to solicit, exchange or possess any content that shows a minor under 18 engaging in sexual activity. In New York, where Adams was during some of his exchanges with Ava, there are similar laws regarding children younger than 17. Federal statutes use 18 as the age of adulthood. The Times quoted legal experts who said that prosecuting such cases involves disputes over jurisdiction and whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age.
As for the "extremely serious and outlandish" accusations by the adult women, Brettler said Adams doesn't have the power to make or break careers. The lawyer said Adams believes some of the allegations are “grousing by disgruntled individuals” who blamed Adams for personal or professional disappointments and were now out to harm him.
The Times report is another in a series of reports that have spurred the #MeToo movement to call out sexual misconduct across multiple industries, especially in media and entertainment. So far, not many music stars have been among the named and shamed, probably because few people expect rock stars to be Boy Scouts.
"But many in the business say that harassment and inequitable treatment of women is pervasive and that the 'sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll' ethos has shielded men from being held to account," the Times reported.

According to the Times, Adams became a solo star in the early 2000s, with the album "Heartbreaker" and songs like "New York, New York," at the same time he was bedeviled with notorious addiction and mental health issues.
He was an "early adopter" in reaching out directly to his audience via social media, and used Twitter and Instagram to scout and meet female artists. "It was on Twitter that he found Ava, who excitedly messaged him to say hello after she followed him and he followed her back.
“I was really alone,” Ava told the Times, “and he was really friendly and cool. ”
The Times named some of the women it interviewed, including Phoebe Bridgers and Courtney Jaye, two musicians who were initially beguiled by Adams' energy and enthusiasm for their career prospects. But they were shaken after he became obsessive and abusive in pursuit of sex. Two other female singer-songwriters described similar patterns but were not identified.
In his statement, Adams said he was saddened by what the women in his past life said, and promised to do better.
"As someone who has always tried to spread joy through my music and my life, hearing that some people believe I caused them pain saddens me greatly," he said. "I am resolved to work to be the best man I can be. And I wish everyone compassion, understanding and healing. ”

Anti-Iran Message Seeps Into Trump's Warsaw Forum on the Middle East

Texto completo: WARSAW -- The Trump administration had delicately said the meeting of five dozen nations in Warsaw would focus on "Middle East security." But the unmistakable voice of Rudolph Giuliani, an avowed proponent of regime change in Iran, set a different tone.
Hours before the meeting began, Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and President Trump's lawyer, told an anti-Iran rally outside Warsaw's main stadium that Iranian leaders are "assassins, they are murderers and they should be out of power."
Mr. Giuliani said he was representing an Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or M.E.K., not Mr. Trump. But his message belied what American officials had told nervous European counterparts: that the two-day meeting would focus on a range of Middle East security matters.
As Mr. Giuliani spoke, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in northeast Poland witnessing live-fire exercises intended to send a message to Russia. And Vice President Mike Pence, joined by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was arriving in Warsaw for what amounted to the largest diplomatic gathering that the Trump administration has organized.
Still, the mixed signals and ad hoc arrangements for the gathering -- the first of nearly all Middle East states, Europe and the United States in years -- made some of America's closest allies anxious.
Britain, France and Germany vociferously protested Mr. Trump's decision last year to quit the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and were loath to participate in a forum they saw as designed to push Iran toward collapse. Only last week those same three countries embraced a sanctions-evading barter system that would, in theory, enable Iran to trade in oil, defying Mr. Trump.
The French and Germans dispatched career diplomats to the meeting, not foreign ministers. Britain's foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, agreed to attend at the last moment, on promises that he could lead a session on Yemen.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel arrived seeking an opportunity to edge closer to the Sunni Arab states that share his desire to confront Iran's military.
Running for re-election in April while under threat of a corruption indictment in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu is looking for a major victory. Using the Iran threat as a way to openly display Israel's strengthening relations with onetime Arab adversaries would help achieve it.
But Mr. Netanyahu clearly did not get the memo that Iran was supposed to be discussed obliquely. No sooner had he landed than the prime minister's Twitter account announced "an open meeting with representatives of leading Arab countries, that are sitting down together with Israel in order to advance the common interest of war with Iran."
An hour later, the Twitter posting was changed to "advance the common interest of combating Iran."
Even that exceeded what Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Pence said at an opening dinner. The agenda includes Syria, refugees, terrorism, cyberconflict and an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that Mr. Kushner promises to eventually present.
Iran's expansion into Syria is Mr. Netanyahu's biggest concern, said Dore Gold, former director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, and the Warsaw meeting could help persuade others that he is not exaggerating the threat.
"It's not Israel in the front row, and Arab states secretly promoting an agenda to get Iran out of Syria," Mr. Gold said. "It's overt, public, and only strengthens the case that Israel's been making over the last year."
Countering the American-led gathering, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced a summit meeting with the leaders of Iran and Turkey in Sochi on Thursday, the main day of the Warsaw conference, setting up rival events.
Mr. Putin's move also highlighted the growing American antagonism toward Russia, which, along with China, participated in the negotiation of the 2015 nuclear agreement.
And Mr. Pompeo, who usually avoids gaps between his positions and Mr. Trump's, spent much of his day portraying Russia as untrustworthy, with a ferocity Mr. Trump has never shown.
"Russia has grand designs of dominating Europe and reasserting its influence on the world stage," Mr. Pompeo told American troops at the NATO base in Orzysz, about 40 miles from the Russian border at Kaliningrad. "Vladimir Putin seeks to splinter the NATO alliance, weaken the United States and disrupt Western democracies."
He referred to Russian "hybrid warfare" against the United States even as Mr. Trump continues to question Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Pompeo also promised to counter any Russian threat.
"Poland's own history reminds us that enduring deterrence measures should be at the forefront of our strategic thinking," he said.
The message was reiterated by Mr. Pence, who spent much of the day greeting American and Polish troops and emphasizing the United States-Polish alliance to President Andrzej Duda. He found a receptive audience in Mr. Duda, who has pushed the Trump administration for a greater American military presence in the country, even suggesting a base called "Fort Trump."
The vice president said that he would ensure Mr. Trump heard Poland's request to "continue and even expand" American troop levels of around 4,500. "The Polish people need no lectures on the dangers of an aggressive Russia," Mr. Pence told Mr. Duda.
The Warsaw conference, scheduled over two days, coincided with the 40th anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
In Iran, where a suicide bomber in the restive southeast killed at least 27 members of the Revolutionary Guards Corps on Wednesday, the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the Warsaw conference would change nothing.
"The Warsaw conference is dead on arrival," he told reporters. "It is another attempt by the United States to pursue an obsession with Iran that is not well founded."
Mr. Zarif, who has used his Twitter account to parry anti-Iran messages from American officials like Mr. Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said the aim of the conference was a United States diktat on Iran.
The Poles have sought to walk a delicate line between the United States and Iran, framing Poland's hosting of the meeting as a positive event, while trying to avoid angering the Iranians. The underlying tensions were apparent on Tuesday when Poland's consul general in New York, Maciej Golubiewski, was asked if Iran was a threat to Poland, during an interview with The New York Times Editorial Board.
"Poland never said Iran is a threat to Poland," Mr. Golubiewski said. "Poland is engaged in a lot of multilateral efforts to bring about stability and peace in the Middle East and the world."
Mr. Giuliani, for his part, reveled in condemning Iran even as he insisted he was in no way speaking for the Trump administration. He said the M.E.K. had been his client for 12 years, and that he had often spoken on its behalf, often for a fee.
In July, Mr. Giuliani attended a Paris rally sponsored by the M.E.K. that the police later said was the target of a failed bombing attempt that investigators suspected was engineered by Iranian agents.
Busloads of M.E.K. activists attended the rally outside Warsaw's national stadium, where Thursday's diplomatic meeting will be held. They waved Iranian flags and held aloft giant yellow balloons with "Regime Change" written in block letters.
"We want to see a regime change in Iran," Mr. Giuliani said.

Texto completo: Apple Inc.'s plan to create a subscription service for news is running into resistance from major publishers over the tech giant's proposed financial terms, according to people familiar with the situation, complicating an initiative that is part of the company's efforts to offset slowing iPhone sales.
In its pitch to some news organizations, the Cupertino, Calif., company has said it would keep about half of the subscription revenue from the service, the people said.
The service, described by industry executives as a "Netflix for news," would allow users to read an unlimited amount of content from participating publishers for a monthly fee. It is expected to launch later this year as a paid tier of the Apple News app, the people said.
The rest of the revenue would go into a pool that would be divided among publishers according to the amount of time users spend engaged with their articles, the people said.
Representatives from Apple have told publishers that the subscription service could be priced at about $10 a month, similar to Apple's streaming music service, but the final price could change, some of the people said.
The New York Times and the Washington Post are among the major outlets that so far haven't agreed to license their content to the service, in part because of concerns over the proposed terms, which haven't been previously disclosed, according to the people familiar with the matter.
Talks are ongoing, and deals with the publishers could still be reached.
The Wall Street Journal also has concerns, though its recent conversations with Apple have been productive, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
Another concern for some publishers is that they likely wouldn't get access to subscriber data, including credit-card information and email addresses, the people said. Credit-card information and email addresses are crucial for news organizations that seek to build their own customer databases and market their products to readers.
Apple proposed that at least some publishers supply access to their content for a minimum of a year, the people familiar with the matter said. Some publishers want a longer commitment, while others want flexibility to exit from the partnership earlier.
Apple declined to comment.
The news service is part of Apple's effort to find growth as iPhone sales stall.
The tech giant last month reported its first decline in revenue and profit in a decade for the three months ended in December, after iPhone sales fell 15% to $51.98 billion.
Apple is trying to offset the downturn in its core smartphone business with a fast-growing services business that includes app-store sales, streaming-music subscriptions and mobile payments.
This year, the company plans to launch several new services, including original TV programming and the news service.
It is seeking to increase the number of paid subscriptions across its devices to 500 million by 2020, up from 360 million now.
Apple has discussed bundling the news offering with a forthcoming package of original TV shows and iCloud, a storage service for photos, documents and more, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
Apple is attempting to woo a news industry that has grown wary of the influence of big technology companies on their businesses.
Facebook Inc., long a major source of traffic for publishers, has altered its News Feed in ways that contributed to steep audience and revenue declines for some media companies. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has faced scrutiny for allowing readers to circumvent digital paywalls, a practice the search giant has since mitigated.
Digital subscriptions are powering growth at big publishers including the Times, whose basic monthly subscription costs $15, the Post, which charges $10, and the Journal, which charges $39.
Some of those companies are skeptical about giving up too much control to Apple or cannibalizing their existing subscriptions to sign up lower-revenue Apple users, according to people familiar with the matter.
But tech platforms also present a huge opportunity. Apple News, a free service that comes installed on iPhones and lets users pick news by topic or publication, gives news organizations an entree to millions of upscale, sophisticated news consumers. Apple's pitch is that it will allow publishers to expand their subscription base.
The three outlets already distribute a subset of their articles on Apple News, which readers can access free.
News organizations keep 100% of the revenue from ads they sell for these articles, and they keep 70% of revenue from ads that appear alongside their articles that they don't sell.
Apple's planned subscription service would dramatically expand access to those outlets, adding content that is currently behind paywalls.
Users can also subscribe to news organizations through Apple News; news organizations keep 70% of the subscription revenue for the first year and a larger portion after that.
Last year, Apple purchased Texture, an app that allows its users to read an unlimited amount of magazine content for a $9.99 monthly subscription.
Bloomberg earlier reported that Texture would be integrated with Apple News as a premium product.

Texto completo: I set out to write a column three weeks ago about what Jeff Bezos' divorce might mean for Amazon, but was pulled up short by an unanswered question. Was his new girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, responsible for leaking the text messages and photos that found their way to the National Enquirer? Applying Occam's razor, it was the likeliest explanation. If so, Mr. Bezos' judgment about whom to trust might be a legitimate worry for investors. But since I had no evidence on this point and didn't feel like speculating at Ms. Sanchez's expense, I dropped the subject.
In the three weeks since, we appear to have part of an answer. The Enquirer again not covering itself in glory -- journalists are supposed to protect their sources -- leaked that the source was Ms. Sanchez's brother.
This does not absolve Ms. Sanchez. My siblings see what's on my phone only if I forward it to them.
But at least a red herring is being dispatched back to the deep. Mr. Bezos and his associates deliberately promoted a Hollywood-sized misdirection, with spies and political conspiracy extending all the way to the White House and Saudi Arabia.
If this doesn't remind you of the Steele dossier, perhaps it should. Except that the instrument for making these speculations publishable was not the FBI; it was Mr. Bezos' own Washington Post. Never mind that the only real lead Mr. Bezos' agent provided to the paper concerned the possible role of Ms. Sanchez's pro-Trump brother. If so, means and motive were complete: It was unnecessary to speculate about Donald Trump and the Saudis -- a filigree spun on top of the tawdry facts to distract and excite the media.
Only after the Post's front-page fantasia appeared came the now-infamous exchange in which the Enquirer allegedly threatened to publish Mr. Bezos' private photos and texts (which it withheld from its original story). But we must take Mr. Bezos' word for what was said. He doesn't even quote his side of the exchange. As others have pointed out, blackmail is not always illegal. Consider the following hypothetical exchange:
Bezos representative: If you publish his illegally obtained texts and photos, Mr. Bezos will sue you on X, Y, Z grounds.
National Enquirer: We won't publish them if you desist from saying our story was politically motivated and pursuing the identity of our source.
This is a negotiation, not a criminal act.
Mr. Bezos' interest seems self-evident to me: Injecting the Trump-Saudi red herring draws attention away from his own carelessness and that of Ms. Sanchez. After all, being a hero of the anti-Trump resistance, especially when Amazon lately has been vilified from the left, is better than being the chump starring in a garden-variety case of rich-guy infidelity.
I have no brief for the kind of journalism that National Enquirer does. I sympathize with Mr. Bezos, whose privacy was invaded. But our First Amendment allows the Enquirer to do what it did in Mr. Bezos' case.
I also know what I don't know. Our press seems increasingly helpless in the face of evidence-free red herrings aimed at its erogenous zones. See the widely circulated email in which Bob Woodward uncritically associates himself with Mr. Bezos' narrative. The incentive to participate in other people's idealized self-images is well-known in psychology. Journalists should guard against it. But, in truth, exhibiting compliance with the self-images of their sources is how many journalists do their jobs.
Which is why I strongly favor one part of what's unfolding here: the media genuinely interesting itself in how such stories based on anonymous sources and leaks come to be published.
When the press gets done with Mr. Bezos' private messages, let's find out who leaked decades-old private Trump family tax documents to the New York Times. Let's inquire into the source or sources who misrepresented to CNN, MSNBC and CBS the date on an email to make it look like the Trump campaign was in cahoots with WikiLeaks.
I could go on. How some stories come to be written strikes me as a lot more newsworthy than the stories themselves. That was certainly true of Russia's alleged role in Democratic email leaks feasted on by the press in 2016, or North Korea's sponsoring of the Sony Pictures frenzy of 2014.
It would be great if responsible media organizations looked with more skepticism on each other's reporting and sourcing. Every time the press reports what some source wants it to report, the press is serving not only an ostensible public interest but someone's private interest. Our national agenda and dialogue is constantly being shaped by leaks that serve an unproclaimed agenda. That being so, the media merit the same skepticism directed at other institutions.
In fact, when an institution so loudly professes its incorruptibility as the press does -- "Democracy dies in darkness" is the Post's slogan -- that would normally be a reason for especially immediate and searching skepticism.

Judge's Ruling Might Reveal the Secrets Of a Grisly Crime, Unsolved for Decades

Texto completo: On July 25, 1946, two black couples were riding in a car in Walton County, Ga., when they were mobbed by a group of white men. They were dragged from the car at gunpoint and tied up. Then they were shot -- about 60 times, at close range -- and killed.
The episode, which became known as the Moore's Ford lynchings, is considered by many to be the last mass lynching in American history. It prompted national outrage and led President Harry Truman to order a federal investigation, making the case a critical catalyst for the civil rights movement.
Although a grand jury convened and witnesses testified for 16 days, no one was ever charged and the case remains unsolved.
Now, more than 70 years later, what those witnesses said may be on the verge of becoming public.
On Monday, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, affirmed a lower court's ruling that had ordered the release of the grand jury transcripts from 1946. In a 2-to-1 opinion, Judge Charles R. Wilson wrote that the event was so clearly of "exceptional historical significance" that "the interest in disclosure outweighed the interest in continued secrecy."
"I was over the moon," Anthony Pitch, the author and historian who sued for the records, said in a telephone interview Monday night. "Who knows what treasure lies in those sealed documents; it's obvious to me that something is hidden there."
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. It is unclear whether the department will appeal the ruling.
In his ruling, Judge Wilson wrote that racial tensions in Georgia were high in 1946, as black citizens were being allowed to vote in a Georgia Democratic Party primary for the first time that year.
The events leading up to the Moore's Ford lynchings -- named after a bridge about 60 miles east of Atlanta that the car was crossing -- began when one of the victims, Roger Malcom, was jailed on suspicion of stabbing a white farmer who was his employer. Though the particulars of the stabbing are unclear, in one version of events, Mr. Malcom was said to have confronted his boss about having sex with Dorothy Malcom, his common-law wife, who was reportedly pregnant.
Eleven days later, Loy Harrison, a different white farmer, bailed out Mr. Malcom at the request of his family. Mr. Malcom, his wife, his sister, Mae Murray Dorsey, and her husband, George -- a World War II Army veteran -- were riding in a car with Mr. Harrison when they were attacked.
Mr. Harrison, now dead, later told the federal investigators that on the way home, he was stopped by a group of men, who took his four passengers at gunpoint. But many in Walton County believe that Mr. Harrison was a Klan member and had bailed out Mr. Malcom with the intention of releasing him to a Klan mob.
The four victims were between 20 and 30 years old when they were "marched to a thicket where they were executed," according to a 1946 story in The New York Times.
Senator William Knowland of California called the lynching a "blot on the whole United States." Ellis Arnall, the governor of Georgia at the time, offered a $10,000 reward for tips on the lynching mob.
The grand jury investigation lasted three weeks in December 1946. Even though more than 100 people were subpoenaed, the jury -- made up of 21 white people and two black people -- was not able to identify members of the 20-person lynching mob.
In 1991, a man who said he had seen the killings came forward, telling reporters that Mr. Harrison had been among the gunmen. And in 2013, the crime resurfaced again when a white man in his 50s said in an interview with the N.A.A.C.P. that he had grown up hearing adults talking about the killings and that some of those responsible were still alive.
Judge James L. Graham, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, who served on the appellant panel and dissented, noted the possibility that unsealing the grand jury testimony could affect people who are still living. He wrote: "The vitality of the community's continued interest" in the case "raises possible repercussions for the living descendants and relatives of those individuals whom the grand jury records will identify as being suspects, witnesses and grand jurors."
Over the years, filmmakers, activists and relatives of the victims have campaigned for justice through documentaries, event re-enactments and by participating in the continuing search for more information.
Atanya Lynette Hayes, Mr. Malcom's granddaughter, said Monday that her father kept up with the case until he died in 2016. In a telephone interview from her home in Ohio, Ms. Hayes, 49, said Monday night that she had cried at her desk when she was told that the appellate court had ruled in favor of releasing the grand jury testimony.
"My father died without closure," she said. "We want someone to be held accountable for the wrong."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Apple Inc.'s plan to create a subscription service for news is running into resistance from major publishers over the tech giant's proposed financial terms, according to people familiar with the situation, complicating an initiative that is part of the company's efforts to offset slowing iPhone sales.
In its pitch to some news organizations, the Cupertino, Calif., company has said it would keep about half of the subscription revenue from the service, the people said. The service, described by industry executives as a "Netflix for news," would allow users to read an unlimited amount of content from participating publishers for a monthly fee. It is expected to launch later this year as a paid tier of the Apple News app, the people said.
The rest of the revenue would go into a pool that would be divided among publishers according to the amount of time users spend engaged with their articles, the people said. Representatives from Apple have told publishers that the subscription service could be priced at about $10 a month, similar to Apple's streaming music service, but the final price could change, some of the people said.
The New York Times and the Washington Post are among the major outlets that so far haven't agreed to license their content to the service, in part because of concerns over the proposed terms, which haven't been previously disclosed, according to the people familiar with the matter.
Talks are ongoing, and deals with the publishers could still be reached.
The Wall Street Journal also has concerns, but its recent conversations with Apple have been productive, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
Another concern for some publishers is that they likely wouldn't get access to subscriber data, including credit-card information and email addresses, the people said. Credit-card information and email addresses are crucial for news organizations that seek to build their own customer databases and market their products to readers.
Apple proposed that at least some publishers supply access to their content for a minimum of a year, the people familiar with the matter said. Some publishers want a longer commitment, while others want flexibility to exit from the partnership earlier.
Apple declined to comment.
The news service is part of Apple's effort to find growth as iPhone sales stall. The tech giant last month reported its first decline in revenue and profit in a decade for the three months ended in December, after iPhone sales fell 15% to $51.98 billion. Apple is trying to offset the downturn in its core smartphone business with a fast-growing services business that includes app-store sales, streaming-music subscriptions and mobile payments.
This year, the company plans to launch several new services, including original TV programming and the news service. It is seeking to increase the number of paid subscriptions across its devices to 500 million by 2020, up from 360 million now.
Apple has discussed bundling the news offering with a forthcoming package of original TV shows and iCloud, a storage service for photos, documents and more, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
Apple is attempting to woo a news industry that has grown wary of the influence of big technology companies on their businesses. Facebook Inc., long a major source of traffic for publishers, has altered its News Feed in ways that contributed to steep audience and revenue declines for some media companies. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has faced scrutiny for allowing readers to circumvent digital paywalls, a practice the search giant has since mitigated.

Digital subscriptions are powering growth at big publishers including the Times, whose basic monthly subscription costs $15, the Post, which charges $10, and the Journal, which charges $39. Some of those companies are skeptical about giving up too much control to Apple or cannibalizing their existing subscriptions to sign up lower-revenue Apple users, according to people familiar with the matter.
But tech platforms also present a huge opportunity. Apple News, a free service that comes installed on iPhones and lets users pick news by topic or publication, gives news organizations an entree to millions of upscale, sophisticated news consumers. Apple's pitch is that it will allow publishers to expand their subscription base.
The three outlets already distribute a subset of their articles on Apple News, which readers can access free. News organizations keep 100% of the revenue from ads they sell for these articles, and they keep 70% of revenue from ads that appear alongside their articles that they don't sell. Apple's planned subscription service would dramatically expand access to those outlets, adding content that is currently behind paywalls.
Users can also subscribe to news organizations through Apple News; news organizations keep 70% of the subscription revenue for the first year and a larger portion after that.
Last year, Apple purchased Texture , an app that allows its users to read an unlimited amount of magazine content for a $9.99 monthly subscription.
Bloomberg earlier reported that Texture would be integrated with Apple News as a premium product.

SPORTS MEDIA; Adler gets a changeover from ESPN

Texto completo: Two years and a wrongful termination lawsuit later, Doug Adler says fighting for his professional life was "like the longest tennis match I've ever played in, but I have thankfully persevered."
The entire charade shouldn't have lasted more than a Hawk-Eye replay.
ESPN yanked the tennis analyst, a onetime USC All-American player from Sherman Oaks, off its 2017 Australian Open coverage in the social media afterburn of a tweet by New York Times freelance tennis writer Ben Rothenberg. He questioned Adler's use of the phrase "guerrilla effect" to describe a Venus Williams strategy of charging the net, which she did successfully during an early-round 6-3, 6-2 win over Stefanie Voegele. The coverage was on ESPN's Interactive feed accessible by DirecTV subscribers, so it's difficult to say how many people -- or really, how few -- actually heard Adler's call.

Any abhorrent effort to translate "guerrilla" to "gorilla" and imply racism or disrespect was misguided. Nike used "guerrilla tennis" as the theme of an Andre Agassi-Pete Sampras commercial campaign in 1995, which many people say is still history's most successful tennis ad campaign.
After he was let go, Adler went to the court of public opinion and explained his side on NBC's "Today Show." An ESPN spokesman said: "Adler made an inappropriate reference to Venus Williams for which he felt no apology was necessary. We disagree and stand 100% behind our decision" to take him off the tournament "for making an inappropriate comment."
The network held serve on that stance until last week. The same spokesman confirmed via email: "We have amicably resolved our dispute with Doug Adler," including the intent to hire him for future ESPN tennis events.
Why finally a change of heart, and done so quietly before this resolution was reported last week by the New York Post?
ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro, who came on board in March 2018, has said he wants "less politics and more sports" as he tries to recalibrate the network culture since the departure of John Skipper in December 2017. More tennis content is also being used on the ESPN+ pay-to-view platform.
Adler, who suffered a heart attack a year ago, said he "can't be more ready to move forward after all this. I feel the weight of the world off my shoulders. I was living, breathing, sleeping and eating this travesty for two years."
A lawsuit set for L.A. Superior Court in October had been delayed until May of this year, but Adler said his lawsuit "was never about the money, it was always about my reputation and credibility -- getting my voice back."
When he does go back on the air, which could be during ESPN's coverage at Wimbledon, Adler seems wise enough not to bring back that phrase, even though he knows it was taken out of context.
"I'd have to be foolish to use it and put myself under that kind of scrutiny," he said. "... Who'd want to go through that again?"
Costas irks NBC
NBC says it is "disappointed" in Bob Costas because he chose to "mischaracterize ... private interactions" pertaining to his removal from the network's Super Bowl LII broadcast last year.
Right back at you, NBC. You had a year to come clean with your reasons.
Costas picked reporter Mark Fainaru-Wada of ESPN's "E:60" for his big reveal Sunday -- that he was told by NBC executives that he "crossed a line" in offering opinions on-air about the NFL concussion controversy, and that's why he was removed from the broadcast team.
Costas had already told other media outlets he believed TV networks, including Fox, had been bowing to pressure from the NFL and did not want to threaten their cozy relationship.
This time, Costas just had more of a personal spin on the matter, which further explains why he and NBC parted ways last month, ending a 40-year run.
It speaks highly of ESPN's journalistic boundary to separate its NFL partnership, just as it speaks poorly of NBC's commitment to Costas, who said that NBC Sports Chairman Mark Lazarus and Executive Producer Sam Flood squashed one of his concussion-related essays before a 2015 "Sunday Night Football" game.
Now, ESPN has all sorts of platforms to present the Costas confession in perpetuity. All of which is problematic to NBC.
College ball
Ted Enberg, the 30-year-old son of the late great Dick Enberg, has landed a play-by-play job with USC baseball this season. Beginning with Friday's opener, Enberg will do live stream of all 35 Trojans home games (https://pac-12.com/live/usc) as well as continue work for the Pac-12 Networks.
"It's a very cool opportunity," Enberg said. "I was in the right time and the right fit."
Meanwhile, Tim Wilhelm starts his 12th season doing UCLA baseball on the school's website (https://ucla.leanplayer.com).
Former Dodgers play-by-play man Ross Porter, 80, starts his fourth season with Cal State Northridge with a 30-game home slate of games accessible on audiostream with some on CSUN Sports Network videostreaming.
"It's been so gratifying when someone who wants you also makes you feel happy too," Porter said. "My wife and I feel part of the family now. You don't get that too much in a broadcasting career anymore, especially if you're in the professional ranks."

Texto completo: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news , offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here .
Hello, friends. I'm Kate Conger, a tech reporter in The Times's San Francisco bureau. It has been another earnings news week, which means we're learning exactly how much money the local tech companies earned in 2018.
The news might not surprise you: Everyone in Silicon Valley is still raking in cash. Apple is the country's most valuable public company again, after briefly losing the title to Amazon. Facebook has shattered its own considerable records for profit and revenue, despite increasing scrutiny of its business practices.
And a flock of companies is set to join the tech giants in the public market. Slack, the workplace chat app that I compulsively check throughout my day, has filed for its initial public offering. It's now in line behind Uber and Lyft for a 2019 debut on Wall Street. Airbnb and Pinterest are likely to follow, bringing a fresh wave of money to one of the most expensive regions in the United States.
New wealth and tech is nothing new, of course. But it is notable that tech companies have done so well in a difficult year for the industry.
Executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter were called to Washington to answer lawmakers' concerns about political bias, privacy violations and excessive market power.
In Europe, antitrust worries are on the rise. In 2017, Google paid what was a record fine of $2.7 billion. Last year, Google was fined again, this time for $5.1 billion.
Just this past week, Germany announced that it would crack down on the way Facebook collects and combines data on its users as they browse the web. British doctors recommended that parents limit their children's exposure to screens and social media, while my co-worker Brian X. Chen wrote about "bait apps" that trick kids into spending money online.
The tech industry's honeymoon with the rest of the world seems to be over. Except when it comes to making money.
Snapchat and Twitter, two social media services that seemed to be struggling just months ago, posted better-than-anticipated earnings this past week. Google, which is facing down employee protests and regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe, posted a 22 percent increase in revenue.
Our Google beat reporter, Daisuke Wakabayashi, wrote why it's possible for tech firms to continue earning record profits even as the public's perception of them sours. Google, he said, is the "internet's ultimate beachfront property." If you want to swim in the ocean, you need to walk across Google's private beach first.
Even if you don't like the way a tech company behaves, boycotting may be an impossible challenge.
I've been fascinated by Kashmir Hill's series at Gizmodo about her struggles to extricate herself from the so-called Big Five: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook. She recounted all the missed texts and wrong turns she made as she tried to get through her day without the technology that I take for granted. The series is a warning about the uphill battle we'd all face if we decided to limit our collective tech addiction.
And as long as it remains difficult to quit, tech's profits will continue to soar.
In other news:
■ Newsrooms are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence to churn out quick news pieces about earthquakes, sports scores and -- of course -- earnings. "Robot reporters" are on the rise at Bloomberg, The Washington Post and other publications. Here at The Times, our A.I. experimentation has been limited to newsletter personalization, Jaclyn Peiser reports. Maybe someday soon, a robot reporter will be picking these stories to share with you.
■ Did you know the North Pole could move? I learned that the magnetic north pole is heading toward Siberia at a surprising pace, thanks to a fascinating report from Shannon Hall. The pole, which I'd always assumed was a fixed point, is on the move thanks to the "sloshing" of liquid iron in the outer core of the Earth, and we have to continually track it so that navigation systems remain reliable. But we're a bit behind because of the government shutdown.
■ Instacart revised its tipping policy this past week after backlash from the delivery people who pick up items for shoppers and deliver them to their doorsteps. Late last year, Instacart started counting tips against payments to its delivery people, essentially stripping them of their tips.
"It's offensive, it's unethical, and in this climate it's a very dumb thing to do," one Instacart courier told Kevin Roose. Now, Instacart has reversed course and will include tips on top of the delivery fee it pays its shoppers.
■ Even though Facebook is banned in China, the company found a way to generate an estimated $5 billion from the country, Paul Mozur and Lin Qiqing report. To tap the market, Facebook has created what sounds like an Ikea floor model that allows interested advertisers to familiarize themselves with the platform while it remains hidden behind China's Great Firewall.

Texto completo: BEIJING -- Turkey has called China's mass repression of its Uighur Muslim ethnic minority a "great shame for humanity" and has urged the Chinese government to close detention camps estimated to hold a million people, a rare rebuke from a majority-Muslim country.
In its statement on Saturday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned China's "reintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st century and the policy of systematic assimilation" in its far western region of Xinjiang as a violation of the "fundamental human rights" of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.
"It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks incurring arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in internment camps and prisons," said the statement from Hami Aksoy, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. He called on the international community and the secretary general of the United Nations to take action to end the "human tragedy."
The statement came in response to a question about recent reports that Abdurehim Heyit, a prominent Uighur folk poet and musician, had died in a Chinese internment camp. According to the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Heyit died while serving the second year of an eight-year prison sentence over one of his songs.
The New York Times has been unable to independently confirm Mr. Heyit's death.
The Chinese government did not address reports of the musician's death in a statement on Sunday, and the Xinjiang regional government did not respond to requests for comment. Later Sunday, however, a video apparently showing Mr. Heyit alive was posted on the Turkish language website of China Radio International, a Chinese official news service.
In a statement on Sunday, the Chinese Embassy in Turkey called the Turkish Foreign Ministry's statement a "serious violation of the facts," defending its actions in Xinjiang as necessary to combat terrorism and extremist ideology.
"Since the 1990s, 'three forces' inside and outside China (ethnic separatist forces, religious extremist forces, violent terrorist forces) have planned and organized thousands of violent terrorist incidents in Xinjiang, China, resulting in the injuries and deaths of a large number of innocent people of all ethnic groups," the statement said. "The sinful acts of these horrific elements have not only seriously undermined the peaceful and stable order of Xinjiang but also the atmosphere of unity and progress."
Rejecting the Turkish characterization of China's mass detention program, the Chinese statement said the camps were "teaching and training centers" intended to provide instruction in Mandarin, law and vocational skills, and to rid students of extremist thoughts.
"The allegations that the Chinese government is trying to 'eliminate' the ethnic, religious and cultural identity of the Uighurs and other Muslim groups are completely untenable," it said.
The statement from Turkey, which is home to a large community of Chinese Uighurs, came as a surprise to members of the Uighur diaspora, many of whom have been pressuring the governments of predominantly Muslim countries to speak out about China's crackdown on Muslim communities.
Despite growing evidence of forced labor, indoctrination and other abuses in Xinjiang, countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan have remained relatively silent on the issue -- a sign, some say, of China's increasing political and economic clout. While the governments of Malaysia and Indonesia have voiced concerns about the Uighurs, Turkey's statement is by far the strongest yet from a majority-Muslim country.
"Many of us have criticized the Turkish government for its stance on the subject, but today many Uighurs expressed their happiness and joy thanks to the Turkish authorities," Tahir Imin, a Uighur academic and activist, said by telephone from Washington. "This is very encouraging for us. It gives us strength and hope that the Turkish government can lead the way for the other Muslim nations to bring some more pressure on the Chinese government."
Turkey made the statement despite recently receiving a $3.6 billion loan for its energy and transportation sector from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a state-owned bank.
The Chinese crackdown in Xinjiang has targeted more than 100 writers, academics and other Uighur intellectuals, among others, raising fears that it is aimed at erasing the group's unique ethnic identity and cultural memory.
Adrian Zenz, a specialist in China's minority policies who lectures at the European School of Culture and Theology in Korntal, Germany, said that while political calculations were certainly part of Turkey's decision to speak out, the reported death of Mr. Heyit -- known to many as the "Rooster of Xinjiang" because of his voice -- might have been the "drop in the bucket that caused the bucket to overflow."
"Heyit's popularity transcended boundaries," Mr. Zenz said. "He epitomized the cultural connection between Uighurs and the Turkic cultural realm."
Over the weekend, Turkic-language social media was flooded with tributes to Mr. Heyit, one of the first Uighur musicians to write about life under Chinese rule. Many reposted videos of his performances of traditional Uighur songs accompanied by the dutar, a two-stringed lute.
"Music is one of the most important parts of Uighur culture," Mr. Heyit told The Times in an interview in Kashgar in 1999. "People here can wear American T-shirts, but their hearts stay the same. The music, because it's such a symbol of the heart, changes slowly."

Texto completo: Bryce Harper is one of the best players in baseball. He is a six-time All-Star and former MVP who has consistently been one of the top offensive performers in the league. He is just 26 years old, with plenty of career ahead of him. He also has fantastic hair. I mean, it's truly fantastic—as if a unicorn's mane was sculpted by a Beverly Hills salon.
Last fall, Harper—on the verge of free agency—turned down a 10-year, $300 million contract from the only major-league club he's ever played for, the Washington Nationals. His agent reportedly thought that Harper could do better, that a player of his talent and youth would be worth more. So Harper pushed on to free agency.
To date, Harper has not done better . Spring training is around the corner, and Harper has not signed anywhere. Rumors come and go (recently that Harper will go to Philadelphia) but his future remains unclear, even as his hair stays fabulous.
Meanwhile, another talented 26-year-old free agent, Manny Machado—who played in the World Series last season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and may be even better than Harper—is in the same predicament, also unsigned as of this moment.
It is an awkward situation, one that has fueled allegations that miserly baseball owners are ganging up to drive salaries down, a charge they deny. For all the hand-wringing over baseball's future, a lot of clubs have a lot of money. A team like the Red Sox or Yankees could sprinkle truffle oil on the pitcher's mound every inning if they wanted.
Then again, just because you can pay for something doesn't mean it's a great idea. Length of contract appears to be an issue. Nobody doubts Harper and Machado have a lot left in the tank. But 10 years?
This standoff is a bad look for baseball. Every morning, the Journal's great baseball correspondent, Jared Diamond , goes to the window and looks for signs of a Harper or Machado signing, like a farmer trying to locate the first daffodils of spring. And every morning, a disappointed Jared climbs back into bed and reads Springsteen's autobiography for the 700th time.
Journal readers know I am not a man of complaints, but a man of solutions. I want what's best for everyone, so I'm here to make Bryce Harper and Manny Machado a temporary offer:
The Wall Street Journal company softball team.
Look, it isn't Wrigley Field or Dodger Stadium, but Central Park in the springtime. It isn't nothing. And The Wall Street Journal softball team is —believe it or not—pretty dang good. They consistently compete for the championship in the New York City Media Softball League. I know that sounds like winning best wine bar at a truck stop, but you'd be surprised.

Competition is fierce—ranging from Forbes to Institutional Investor to BuzzFeed. The Journal hasn't played the New York Times in years; I believe they decided to focus on dressage.
But the Journal's top rival? The Bonghitters of High Times, the marijuana bible. I promise I'm not baked and making this up. High Times and the Journal are the Red Sox and Yankees of media softball. Those Bonghitters can bash. CBD may indeed be a PED.
I know what you're thinking: Harper and Machado don't work for the Journal, isn't it breaking the rules for them to play for the team? Ummm…have you ever played company softball? There are players on company teams that haven't the foggiest idea of what the company does. The Company Softball Ringer is a beloved tradition.
But if anyone asks, I'll tell them Machado is our new sports columnist. Or he covers private equity. Or Silicon Valley. Harper…he looks like a WSJ Video guy. Everyone in WSJ Video has spectacular hair. I think they recruit in salons.
I'm going a little bit rogue here. I'm not a member of The Wall Street Journal company softball team. I've played two or three times, but I haven't been invited back. I don't think I've ever gotten a hit. Plus, I made an error against WNYC radio, and the WSJ softball team doesn't forgive something like that.
We can't pay Harper and Machado. I should be upfront about that. That might bum them out. But they'd get a nice blue T-shirt, and, once in a while, someone expenses a round of victory beers. I probably shouldn't mention that. I don't know if we can expense victory beers for the company softball team. Forget I said that.
They'll also have to be careful about softball team/office politics. Machado may be one of the best infielders in baseball, but I very much doubt the territorial Journal NBA writer Ben Cohen is going to relinquish his grip on shortstop. If our editor in chief Matt Murray shows up at the last minute, Harper's probably going to the bench. You know how it goes. Company softball gets weird.
But I'm offering these two fine ballplayers a team, camaraderie, a place to belong. I'm sure Major League clubs will eventually come forward and offer Harper and Machado deals. They're going to make many millions for many years.
Good for them. They deserve it. In the meantime, we just need them to show up for the games against High Times.

Google and Facebook Worsen Media Bias; Silicon Valley's advertising monopoly translates into editorial influence.

Texto completo: After the news industry laid off some 2,100 workers from Vice, Gannett, McClatchy, BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed "tech monopolies" that have no "incentive to disseminate high-quality, true information." President Trump blames the press itself: "Fake News and bad journalism have caused a big downturn."
While these diagnoses of journalism's ills appear contradictory, both stem from the same root. Allowing a few platforms to control financing and distribution exacerbates the groupthink Mr. Trump rails against.
More than two-thirds of Americans get news from social media. Google and Facebook control a large majority of the digital advertising market that used to be a major source of revenue for the news industry. Tech companies have leveraged their control of news distribution to entrench their advertising dominance. Facebook's Instant Articles publishes the full text of an article in the platform and shares ad revenue with the publisher. Google punishes publications that raise revenue through subscriptions rather than advertising by downgrading search results of paywalled sites that don't provide free clicks. Google loosened its restrictions after criticism from publishers and threats of European antitrust enforcement, but it also introduced a "Subscribe With Google" service.
Instant Articles and Subscribe With Google may be convenient, but they also give the duopoly more control over the media's revenue and data, further centralizing news distribution. Google and Facebook have gained editorial influence over the press. They enact content guidelines as a condition for participation in advertising services. Both companies consult with left-wing groups such as Media Matters to determine what sites to exclude.
Now Google and Facebook are offering journalism grants to try to make up for their impact on the news industry. Last March the Google News Initiative pledged $300 million to aid publishers, and Facebook promised a similar amount last month. Charity from Big Tech makes the news industry more dependent.
The flow of funds also reflects the companies' Democratic tilt. In 2016 Google sponsored the "Electionland" initiatives with ProPublica, the New York Times, USA Today and Univision, among others, for the stated purpose of "ensuring all Americans could freely exercise their right to vote by shining a light on problems that might get in their way." In practice Electionland's scores of articles universally criticized then-candidate Donald Trump or reinforced the liberal position on issues like voter ID and voter fraud.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. observed that power in America is control of the means of communication. Mr. Trump—who has also accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of political bias—should be more concerned about the concentrated power of Big Tech than any news outlet.
While antitrust law focuses on economic effects, the Supreme Court said in Red Lion Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission (1969) that it also complements the First Amendment's "uninhibited marketplace of ideas," which does not "countenance monopolization of that market." The antidote to media bias isn't schadenfreude over a few publications' travails but antitrust policies to ensure news outlets across the political spectrum can be independent of Silicon Valley.

National Enquirer owner responds to Bezos post, says it 'acted lawfully' in its reporting

Resumen: American Media Inc., owner of the National Enquirer, says in a statement that it "acted lawfully" after Jeff Bezos blasted the company Thursday.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=National+Enquirer+owner+responds+to+Bezos+post%2C+says+it+%27acted+lawfully%27+in+its+reporting&amp;author=Blumenthal%2C+Eli&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-02-10&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: In response to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' pointed allegations of "extortion and blackmail," the National Enquirer's parent company American Media Inc. has responded that it "believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story" on Bezos' relationship with former Los Angeles television news anchor Lauren Sanchez.
In the statement released Friday, AMI says that, at "the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him. "
Bezos blasted the company Thursday night in a blog post on the Medium platform, sharing emails from AMI detailing an alleged extortion and blackmail attempt by the company if Bezos did not put out a statement "affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces. " The emails also demanded Bezos and his investigator agree that they would stop "referring to such a possibility. "
AMI claims in the email that it has a number of intimate images of Bezos and Sanchez, including a "below the belt selfie" of Bezos and a picture of Sanchez "smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene. "

More: Ronan Farrow: I received 'blackmail' threat similar to Amazon's Jeff Bezos
The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and Sanchez's relationship, including romantic text messages the two had sent each other. The Enquirer posted the texts after Bezos' announced last month that he and his wife, MacKenzie, would be getting a divorce after 25 years of marriage.
The leak of these messages prompted Bezos to put Gavin de Becker from his security team on the case of investigating how the Enquirer got a hold of the messages.
In addition to alleging a blackmail attempt, Bezos also claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic” over an investigation The Washington Post was conducted into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Bezos, on top of being the founder of Amazon and the world's richest person, owns The Washington Post.
In his blistering post, Bezos links to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. "
"A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer," Bezos wrote. "They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation. "
Word search:'Apoplectic' and 'complexifier' trend after Jeff Bezos fires back
Pecker is a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Trump has often targeted Bezos, Amazon and The Washington Post on his Twitter feed, including tweeting about all three subjects days after the National Enquirer broke the news that Bezos was seeing Sanchez.
Trump called Bezos "Jeff Bozo" in the tweet, writing that he was "so sorry to hear the news" about Bezos being "taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. "
Federal prosecutors in New York have accused AMI of participating in a scheme to help Trump win the presidency by paying women to keep silent about extramarital affairs he allegedly had with them before the election.
While the company stands by its reporting, AMI does say that, "in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary. ”
AMI's board consists of four members: Pecker, Evan Ratner, Barry Schwartz and David R. Hughes.

Texto completo: Another week, another apology from Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her phony claims of Native American heritage. But the latest evidence against her should spell the end of her presidential ambitions.
The Massachusetts Democrat's discredited story of Indian ancestry has made her an object of ridicule coming from President Donald Trump, who dubbed her "Pocahontas," and conservatives who prefer the more pointed "Fauxcahontas." Liberals have mostly been willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, seemingly accepting each new explanation for her shifting story of how and why she was mistaken for a member of the Cherokee Nation.
Her 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas could put an end to all that. The Washington Post obtained a copy of the signed document in which Warren wrote that her race was "American Indian."
This supports two critical charges against her: that she knowingly and personally claimed Native American heritage, and that she did so for the purpose of career advancement.
Warren has consistently dissembled about how and why she came to be thought of as Native American. When the Boston Herald broke the story during her 2012 Senate campaign, she said that she had no idea Harvard listed her as a minority hire, and that she couldn't "recall" having listed herself as such on any job or "other applications."
The Texas Bar registration shows this isn't true. Also, the document coincides with the year Warren began self-reporting as a "minority professor" in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory. It was also two years after she contributed recipes to the "Pow Wow Chow" Native American cookbook, some of which appear to have been plagiarized from a French chef in The New York Times.
Why would Warren pretend to be an American Indian in the 1980s if later she downplayed the matter as a misunderstanding based on family lore?
Despite the leftist mania to call out supposed "white privilege," the fact is that even in the 1980s minority status could confer distinct advantages in hiring and promotion in career fields dominated by liberals for whom affirmative action is an article of faith. As the 1983 guidance from the American Association of University Professors noted, when it comes to filling academic positions, "in the interests of diversity, affirmative action considerations might control the final selection."
A 2018 investigation by The Boston Globe found little to support the idea that hiring committees, at various law schools where Warren taught, openly discussed her alleged Native American heritage as a factor in bringing her on board. Yet, Harvard was quick to tout her as the law school's first "woman of color," of which Warren said she was unaware. She was identified as a minority winner of a teaching award at the University of Pennsylvania, apparently also without her knowledge. Maybe these schools did not discuss her supposed ethnicity, but they recognized and exploited it.
The Texas Bar registration comes on the heels of Warren's apology for releasing a DNA test finding "strong evidence" that she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago.
DNA evidence is not accepted by the Cherokee Nation anyway, so the whole fiasco shows a terrible sense of judgment — and perhaps panic — on Warren's part.
It is fair to speculate that Warren's presidential campaign will soon be over. If Democrats want to nominate a progressive/socialist who will also be a standard-bearer for identity politics, they have other, more authentic choices available. As a nominee, Warren would have to spend the entire campaign explaining to people of color why her candidacy is not a standing indictment of the cynical abuse of affirmative action programs for personal gain. This would be in addition to having to demonstrate why her outdated economic policies would not turn the United States into the next Venezuela.
President Trump said he would love to run against Warren, and she keeps showing why.

Texto completo: Since Leo Fender started making guitars back in 1946, the Fender name has become synonymous with musical innovation. The iconic brand has outfitted countless music legends with their precious axes, and has set the standard with instantly recognizable inventions including the Stratocaster, Telecaster, and Jazzmaster.
Today, Fender is the largest guitar manufacturer in the world. So why change? "If it ain't broke, don't fit it," the saying goes. Luckily, the most innovative organizations disregard such pedestrian advice.
On Jan. 22, the company broke the mold again with the release of its new Acoustasonic Telecaster. The new instrument — best described as a mash-up of an electric and an acoustic guitar — is profoundly different than anything the world has seen. I recently interviewed Fender's executive in charge of the launch, Billy Martinez.
"This was a three-year journey, taking cues from artists, to fundamentally reimagine the guitar," Martinez told me.
Musicians had a number of frustrations: They loved the feel of their electric, but it sounded pretty weak unplugged. They wanted the warmth of their acoustic, which didn't preform as well plugged in.
Martinez and his team set out to create a single instrument that was easy to play and could meet the broad needs of musicians wanting to toggle between electric and acoustic sounds. Was it possible to have a single guitar replace the need of 10?
With the firm belief that Fender's innovation didn't end decades ago, Martinez started with a blank sheet of paper. The Acoustasonic, which was the result of thousands of hours of design and refinement, is poised to shake up the large and competitive guitar industry.
As a musician myself, I was fascinated. But as an innovator, I was enthralled. Examining the launch, it looks like the wizards at Fender followed these important rules of groundbreaking innovation:
1. Start with the ideal state and work backward Instead of tweaking their existing lineup, Fender had the guts to start fresh. They imagined the ideal instrument, and then figured out how to build it.
2. Break free from restrictive beliefs The design team ran into dozens of "it can't be done" roadblocks, but they didn't let prevailing wisdom dissuade their mission of crafting a profoundly better instrument.
3. Discover the intersection of beauty and performance Lazy designers settle for either-or results. Instead, the Acousasonic is an 'and,' not an 'or'.
4. Design for humans The new instrument had to be comfortable to hold and easy to play. Martinez tells me, "We worked hard to ensure you don't need an engineering degree to figure it out. It had to be super user-friendly, or it was back to the drawing board."
5. Refine until it hurts The first versions of anything are rarely the ones that make history. Whether you're developing a new guitar, drug therapy, or business plan, the creativity must sustain far past the initial idea. It's those painful, endless hours of refinement that create true enduring value.
We'll have to see if the Acoustasonic will achieve the legendary status of its Fender siblings, but the company's innovative and courageous departure from the past stacks the odds in their favor.
These same five rules can apply to your own business, as you fight for competitive advantage and sustainable success. Your instrument may be a laptop, a medical lab, or a saxophone. Regardless of your chosen medium, it's time to create artistry by embracing the principles of groundbreaking innovation.
Rock on.

Relating journalism's Age of Anxiety

Texto completo: NOTE TO READERS: Today's preprinted Arts and Entertainment section features a book review of "Merchants of Truth" by former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson. The review was printed before allegations surfaced that Abramson had plagiarized portions of the book. She has since stated that she will make corrections, noting that the "passages in question involve facts that should have been perfectly cited in my footnotes and weren't."\
'Merchants of Truth'
By Jill Abramson, Simon & Schuster, 534 pages, $30

Jill Abramson owes two debts to David Halberstam and "The Powers That Be," the late writer's epic 1979 examination of four powerful news companies. The first is her career. Reading it inspired her to become a journalist, a path that led to the executive editorship of The New York Times. Three years into that post, Abramson was fired, and Halberstam's book inspired her anew. Surveying a battlefield on which she had become a casualty, she saw a contested future for quality news. What Halberstam had done for a Golden Age in media, Abramson wanted to do for journalism's Age of Anxiety.
Following the Halberstam template, Abramson studies the fortunes of four companies struggling, as she puts it, "to keep honest news alive." Her book, "Merchants of Truth," is a reported meditation on journalism's last decade, told through the experiences of BuzzFeed, The New York Times, Vice and The Washington Post. Like Halberstam's chosen four (Time, The Post, CBS and the Los Angeles Times), Abramson saw at each news organization good and important work. "And all four are endangered," she asserts.
Although journalism about journalism is abundant, Abramson's book represents a distinctly ambitious effort to synthesize a period of dramatic upheaval and help us understand how key industry actors -- and a supporting cast ranging from President Trump to the man who wrote the code for Google News -- have shaped our information diet. Picture a room where the Graham and Sulzberger families confer alongside the drugging, drinking, "feral" founders of the lad mag that would become Vice, all of them making their claims about the future of news, and you've got an idea of the assignment Abramson set for herself.
Establishment and insurgent media take off from opposite ends of the same runway, each faltering when they reach the other's altitude. Legacy newsrooms are tragically slow to understand the internet and the turbulence coming their way, then clumsy and arrogant in integrating the innovations catapulting their young competitors. New-media organizations are portrayed as creative but opportunistic players, building newsrooms to burnish their reputations or fortify new advertising strategies, then tripping over fundamentals, some of them ethical.
On one level, Abramson's book is a love letter to journalism. Its most admired characters are the reporters whose heroics she weaves throughout engrossing, sometimes gossipy profiles of the four companies, women and men working at the top of their game. Meet Elle Reeve, the former computer factory worker who powers Vice's viral video report on the deadly Charlottesville protests, a story of "moral clarity." The Post's David Fahrenthold is the investigative reporter whose relentless digging ("like a bloodhound") into candidate Trump's charity wins a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting. Michael Barbaro is the "Platonic ideal of the new Timesman" -- political reporter, podcaster and elegant writer recrafting a historic election night story when the "Madam President" headline is cratered by Trump's victory. Craig Silverman's dogged reporting distinguishes BuzzFeed as "the media's foremost expert on the subject of fake news, consistently beating other outlets to the punch."
But these valentines appear alongside Abramson's unflinching assessments of executives' miscalculations. Her description of The Post in the period before its sale to Jeff Bezos is a bleak account of a management team struggling to reset in the new news economy. A long-awaited strategy memo, "The Road Forward," is rolled out at a staff meeting and bombs. "While the memo's title was meant to sound visionary and reassuring, an actual road map was entirely missing," Abramson writes.
While digital start-ups deepened their reporting and galloped ahead of their legacy competitors on audience development, Abramson also sees them stumble in establishing norms of journalistic conduct. When BuzzFeed, a brilliant virality machine, first adds news, it's "an experiment in the viability of an operation begun without regard for journalistic ethics (attribution, accountability, etc.) that had gotten a journalistic organ grafted onto it." Abramson cites BuzzFeed's secretive deletion of more than 4,000 posts, plagiarism included, "a redaction of unprecedented scale." Four months after ratifying a code of ethics that would prohibit such actions, Ben Smith, the website's talented young editor, erased three posts from the site that were critical of corporate brands. "The problem wasn't the veracity of the posts, it was that they offended advertisers," she writes. "When Smith realized he'd been caught he reinstated the posts and offered a sheepish apology over email. 'I reacted impulsively,' he admitted, 'and I was wrong.' "
Abramson was researching her book as stories broke in the Daily Beast and the Times about rampant sexual harassment at Vice, but her account is in many ways the richest. Her years writing and editing long-form investigative journalism are on display as she profiles Shane Smith and the "bro-hood" that built a $6 billion company that touched the holy grail -- making money from streaming video to young audiences -- while audaciously upending workplace conventions, including prohibitions against supervisors sleeping with their staffers. In one heartbreaking account, a young producer is told to stay away from a Columbia University award ceremony honoring one of her stories; her boss, with whom she had an affair, will be bringing his wife.
Although Abramson acknowledges the steep decline of local news, she does so as an afterthought. The book travels along the Acela corridor, with occasional trips to the West Coast, and no investigation of how the same forces roiling New York and Washington are shuttering local news shops. In her final chapter, she quotes a journalist from Minnesota who is "outraged that the bleeding of local news wasn't garnering more attention," an ironic note given that it receives no more attention here. That was not the book Abramson set out to write, fair enough. But it does expose a costly limit she imposed in mimicking Halberstam, whose book documented a less fractured, pre-internet age. The nation's shriveling local news report is an industry crisis, and I missed Abramson's reporting applied to that story.
Several subjects of "Merchants of Truth" have alleged inaccuracies in the galleys, some of which have been corrected in the final printing. Abramson was asked about this in a New Yorker interview, and she said that the book was fact-checked but that there "wasn't time" to call back everyone she interviewed.
Other early reports on the book have focused narrowly on Abramson's criticisms of political journalism at her alma mater, and there are several. She describes the post-election news pages of the Times and The Post as "unmistakably anti-Trump," asserting that the Times benefited from an "implicit financial reward" by catering to its liberal audience, an assessment at odds with her criticisms of the paper's aggressive reporting on Hillary Clinton's emails. She also frets about an emerging generational divide in the newsroom eroding the paper's guidelines for fairness. "The more 'woke' staff thought that urgent times called for urgent measures; the dangers of Trump's presidency obviated the old standards," she writes. But these cautions are offered alongside her view that renewed competition between the Times and The Post has made both papers stronger.
Abramson's deeper concerns regard the accelerated collaboration between journalists and business staff and the lucrative blurring of news with advertising (concerns announced by the pairing of "merchants" and "truth" in her title). She rips "native ads" as the industry's "new digital Frankenstein" -- corporate marketing so closely resembling news stories that it may deceive readers. Incubated at shops like BuzzFeed and Vice, the financially seductive campaigns are now part of the advertising menu at legacy publications, an export Abramson laments as "chinks carved in the wall" that has traditionally separated news from commerce.
These views inform Abramson's candid self-portrait, that of an editor who struggled to stitch one era to the next, eager to benefit from the innovations offered by the digital age but cynical about anything that resembled an incursion into historic news values. It was a complicated moment for editors trying to steer their newsrooms across the shallows. Longevity required new kinds of collaborations not common during most of her career, and Abramson had a hard time forming them. When the internal "Times Innovation Report" was leaked to BuzzFeed -- new media breaking one of the biggest legacy media stories of the year -- it described a gifted but ossified newsroom that often rejected digital initiatives as "un-Timesian."
Her account of losing her job reads as a small memoir within the book, a melancholic reconstruction of an event that drew widespread coverage in 2014. Writing in The Washington Post at the time, journalist Amanda Bennett observed that Abramson's firing hit women "like a lightning strike to dry tinder." I suspect that this book, which provides Abramson's first full depiction of the period, will reignite that conversation. She openly describes feeling lonely and depressed at work and alienated from other senior executives. She is critical of her miscalculations, even as she's angered by evidence that her pay lagged that of her male predecessor, a claim the Times disputes.
In one agonizing scene, publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who had promoted her into the job, delivers a written evaluation to her office and remains while Abramson reads it. "In shockingly personal terms, the letter described my moodiness and statements from my closest colleagues that I was a difficult manager," recounts Abramson. "It said nothing about the substance or quality of my work. If I had to boil it down to one sentence it would be 'People think you're a bitch.' "
In four months, she was gone. "I was a less than stellar manager," she concedes four years later, "but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders."

More than 250 guests attended the luncheon for H.O.W., which promotes awareness of the disease, provides scholarships for medical students, supports patients with financial needs and raises money for ovarian cancer research.

Texto completo: The Legend of the Half King
Readers responded at nytimes.com to Derek M. Norman's Jan. 27 article on the closing of the Half King, a bar favored by war reporters and photographers. Comments were edited for length and clarity.
Back in 2005, I was walking on along the bay in Provincetown with my parents when I stumbled upon a clear bottle in the sand. The bottle, which looked worn by the sea, had a rolled message inside of it: "One free pint at the Half King Pub, 505 W 23rd St., New York."
Under the text there was a sketch of a sail boat and a signature: "Sebastian Junger." My parents visited the Half King a few years later for their free pint and to meet our bottle's sender. It is with a heavy heart that I say goodbye to a place that added magic to my family's life all the way out on Cape Cod.
Abra Berkowitz, Provincetown, Mass.
Sounds like it's not just the death of a bar, but a breaking down of a community. Where will these exchanges be able to happen in the future? It's not surprising, having read a recent New York Times article on the soaring real estate values along the High Line, that the pressure on rents is happening.
What is surprising is that the impacts of gentrification in elevating personal wealth of relatively few people at the expense of the wider creative community of New York are not really considered by policymakers and planners.

Manhattan died spiritually, culturally and creatively some time ago. Artists cannot afford it. Ethnic communities can no longer afford it. Visionaries of average means cannot make it. The Salt of the Earth have been extirpated, stomped out and banished. With the outer boroughs next on the chopping block, my time here is limited. But my memories of New York, like a video reel in my mind, still make me smile.
Joshua, New York
There are very few "secret" places anywhere. The internet and social media have seen to that. If that's good or bad, I don't know. What I do know is I've been too many places where the throngs of selfie-stick-wielding tourists made me say, "Never again." Most of those people don't appreciate what they are experiencing; they just want a trophy for Facebook.
Hoss Cartwright, Phoenix
We have to address the problem of mass tourism degrading places that become famous. Tourism has ruined Venice, for example: There are almost no residents left there, and tourism turns many a historic place into a tourist trap. We have to find ways to manage the number of tourists, and what they are allowed to spend on, and controlling the kinds of businesses that can exist in culturally important areas. That goes against the free market, yes, but the free market is ruining the places that we all, including the tourists, want to protect. Without any protection of cultural treasures like the Half King, they are destroyed by the free market.
Paul Rogers, Montreal
During my time living and working in Manhattan throughout the '60s, there were a number of bars where journalists, writers and the like hung out. Some closed even while I was there. I'm sure that by now the others are long gone -- Blakes, Goffs, Downeys ... the list was long. I read from afar about the skyscrapers blocking the light from the streets of the city and know that I can never go back.
The '60s in Manhattan, especially the Village (both) and the Midtown West Side, were magical. Alas. What really closed -- forever -- was the '60s, the freewheeling, alcohol-fueled time of our lives.
Muskateer
Sirens Blared, Skeptics Scrambled
One reader wrote a letter about the Album feature last Sunday, with photographs from the 1950s of the air raid drills that took place in New York City during the early years of the Cold War. When I was in elementary school in Brooklyn in the 1950s, I dutifully hid under my desk during air raid drills, with my jacket over my head. But by the time I was in high school in the early '60s, my friends and I understood that, first, no wooden desk was going to protect us from an atom bomb, and, second, that air raid drills were just another form of Cold War propaganda.
We refused to participate, an early training in civil disobedience that served us well when the Vietnam War came along.

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

Texto completo: LONDON (AP) -- A trove of art collected by singer George Michael before his death in 2016 is going up for auction in London.

Christie's is selling the star's collection, including pieces by Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas -- members of the "Young British Artists" generation who, like Michael, shook up Britain's creative scene in the 1980s and '90s.

Christie's contemporary art expert, Cristian Albu, said Friday that the collection is "a portrait of Britain in the 1990s."

More than 200 works are on offer, including Hirst's "The Incomplete Truth," a glass case enclosing a dove preserved in formaldehyde, which has an estimated price of 1 million to 1.5 million pounds, or $1,280,000 to $1,920,000. The sale takes place March 14, with some lots being sold in an online auction running March 8-15.

Ex-Times editor admits sourcing error in new book

NEW YORK (AP) -- The former executive editor of The New York Times acknowledged Thursday that her new book, "Merchants of Truth," contains some sourcing errors and said she would correct them.

In an email Thursday to The Associated Press, Jill Abramson wrote that some page numbers in sourcing notes needed to be fixed and some sources "should have been cited as quotations in the text."

"The notes don't match up with the right pages in a few cases, and this was unintentional and will be promptly corrected. The language is too close in some cases and should have been cited as quotations in the text. This, too, will be fixed," she wrote.

A Twitter thread posted Wednesday by Vice correspondent Michael C. Moynihan listed several examples of passages in Abramson's book that closely resembled the work of other publications, including Time Out and The New Yorker.

"I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested," Abramson wrote, noting that Vice had previously pointed out factual mistakes. "The book is over 500 pages. All of the ideas in the book are original, all the opinions are mine. The passages in question involve facts that should have been perfectly cited in my footnotes and weren't."

Abramson had defended herself by saying that her book includes extensive endnotes, including web links to sources. It is widely believed that an outside source should be credited in the body of the work if there is a close similarity.

Abramson's book, which is subtitled "The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," was published this week by Simon & Schuster. It is a critique of the media that focuses on two leading newspapers, the Times and The Washington Post, along with Vice and fellow digital company BuzzFeed.

The Rock says he was Oscars' 'first choice' to host

The Oscars almost got to smell what the Rock is cooking.

Entertainment Weekly reports Dwayne Johnson tweeted Wednesday that he was the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' "first choice" to host the Oscars this year but "couldn't make it work" because he's busy working on a sequel to "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle."

Responding to a fan who threw out his name for the hosting job, Johnson wrote, "Ah mahalo dude, I was their first choice to host this year, and my goal was to make it the most fun and entertaining Oscars ever. We all tried hard, but couldn't make it work since I'm shooting Jumanji. Academy and I were super bummed but maybe one day down the road."

A rep for the Academy, which organizes the Oscars, did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment.

Kevin Hart, who co-starred with Johnson in "Welcome to the Jungle" (itself a sequel to 1995's "Jumanji"), was previously named as this year's Oscar host but stepped down after homophobic tweets he had written in the past resurfaced. Hart apologized for his previous comments in a tweet shortly after he dropped out, and again on his Sirius XM radio show, "Straight from The Hart."

Instead of finding a replacement, the Oscars will instead be without a host this year.

Kerry Burke, the new ABC Entertainment president, said Hart's high-profile departure has actually been a boon to the Oscars because it has kept the show "in the conversation."

"It's really compelling. People really care," she told reporters during the Winter Television Critics Association Press Tour in Pasadena, Calif.

The 91st Annual Academy Awards will air live Feb. 24 on ABC at 8 p.m.

Texto completo: Far from a witch hunt or partisan political attack, Democratic congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns are a necessary exercise of legislative oversight responsibility. The president's returns, and those of his 500 businesses, could answer essential questions about his fitness for office, and serve as an invaluable guide to what needs fixing in our tax code.
Congress has a duty to pursue both investigations, and do so promptly.
On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee was set to hold a hearing on a proposal to require presidents and presidential candidates to release their tax returns. But Congress already has the duty and the right to obtain Trump's tax returns. Under a 1924 law enacted in the wake of another administration marked by legal challenges and potential conflicts of interest, the chair of each of three tax-focused committees has the authority to obtain the tax returns of any U.S. citizen, including the president.
This power has, for good reason, been exercised sparingly. It helped Congress unravel the Watergate scandal of the 1970s and was used as recently as 2014 by Republican lawmakers.
Congress should act with urgency because it's likely Trump will resist its efforts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who would ultimately decide on whether to honor a request for Trump's taxes, has been noncommittal, saying only that he "will review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality." That could set up a legal challenge that might last months, if not years, perhaps even past the 2020 election.
But voters deserve answers now, well before the next presidential election. Here's why.
First, a review of Trump's taxes would highlight defects in our tax laws, as explained in a recent report from our organization. As a billionaire who has apparently paid zero federal income taxes in multiple years, Trump could serve as an illustrative example of how the wealthy are able to avoid paying their fair share and help spur urgently needed reform.
Second, we need to know whether and how much Trump gains from the tax policies he promotes and signs into law. We estimate that he and his family could save as much as $22 million from the Trump-GOP tax cuts enacted in 2017. Citizens have a right to know whether their leaders are pursuing policies for their private benefit instead of the public interest.
Another important issue is whether Trump has violated federal law by illegally evading taxes or has shown a disregard for his obligation to pay his fair share by engaging in tax dodging. Last year, The New York Times published an exhaustive report on "dubious" tax avoidance strategies pursued by Trump's family, including what the newspaper declared to be "instances of outright fraud."
The next pressing question is whether Trump's global business interests have compromised the exercise of his official duties.
Contrary to past practice, Trump failed to transfer his assets into a blind trust upon assuming office. Therefore, he has a good idea of how government policies will impact his personal finances. Among the problematic nations he has done business with are Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Trump's tax returns would likely reveal just how deeply involved he is in Russia and with oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Charting Trump's Russian connections might shed light on Trump's inexplicable deference to Putin.
Seeking out information to guide policy reform and keeping an eye on the executive branch are central roles of Congress and its committees. Under new leadership, the House Ways and Means Committee should act promptly to obtain Trump's tax returns in order to better identify flaws in our tax system and to judge serious questions confronting our president.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump administration was set to ignore a Friday deadline for giving the Senate a full accounting of the role of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in the brutal slaying of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi four months ago.
The administration, which has consistently sought to shield Saudi rulers from blame, had until midnight Friday to answer senators' questions about whether Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded, and what additional sanctions should be placed on the government in Riyadh.
The deadline was set by Democratic and Republican senators, who wrote the president on Oct. 10 - slightly more than a week after Khashoggi's disappearance - calling for an investigation.
Senators said Trump was obliged by law to answer within 120 days. Administration officials contended, however, that the law was not binding and that the president could ignore the senators' demands.
A top Saudi official, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir, on Friday insisted the crown prince had no role in Khashoggi's slaying, saying the trial of the suspects and the ongoing investigation would show it was a "rogue operation" with no official backing.
The New York Times reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a 2017 conversation in which Mohamed told a top aide that he would use "a bullet" on Khashoggi, a regime critic, if he did not return home to Saudi Arabia.
Fire at Brazilian soccer academy kills 10, injures 3
RIO DE JANEIRO - Fire tore through the sleeping quarters of an academy for one of Brazil's most popular professional soccer clubs Friday, killing 10 people and injuring three, most likely teenage players, authorities said.
Firefighters were called just after 5 a.m. local time to the sprawling Ninho de Urubu training grounds of the Flamengo soccer club in Rio de Janeiro.
The cause of the fire was not known.
Those killed were not immediately identified by the club but they were athletes, a health official said.
Two of the injured youths were hospitalized in stable condition and one was in critical condition. The ages of the injured were 14, 15 and 16, according to a fire official.
Several people who appeared to be relatives entered the complex without speaking to reporters.
Stone says he should be free
to speak in Russia probe case
WASHINGTON - A federal judge shouldn't bar longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone from making public statements about his criminal case in the Russia investigation, his attorneys said Friday.
Defense lawyers say in a court filing that any limits on Stone's public comments would infringe on his right to free speech.
They made the argument as U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is considering a gag order preventing both sides in the case from making public statements that could prejudice potential jurors.
Jackson raised the issue last week as she told Stone not to treat his criminal case like a "book tour," referring to post-indictment talk show appearances Stone made in which he attacked the investigation as politically motivated.
Iran's top leader defends chants of 'Death to America' by crowds
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is defending "Death to America" chants that are standard fare at anti-U.S. rallies across Iran but says the chanting is aimed at America's leaders and not its people.
Khamenei's website on Friday quoted him as saying the chant means "death to U.S. leaders, death to (President Donald) Trump and John Bolton and (Mike) Pompeo."
He says the Iranian people "will not stop saying 'Death to America' as long as the U.S. acts malicious" toward Iran.
Khamenei was referring to Trump's State of the Union address this week in which the American president, among other things, said: "We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'Death to America.' "
France presses Italy in historic EU dispute
PARIS - France's pro-EU government and Italy's populist leaders sparred anew Friday amid the neighbors' biggest diplomatic spat since World War II.
French officials said Friday that this week's recall of French Ambassador Christian Masset was prompted by months of "unfounded attacks" from Italian government members Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, who have criticized French President Emmanuel Macron's economic and migration policies.
But the main trigger for the crisis appeared to be Di Maio's meeting in a Paris suburb this week with members of the yellow vests - a French anti-government movement seeking seats in the European Parliament - without informing French leaders, who considered it an unwarranted intrusion into the nation's internal affairs.
Steep fall in enforcement by EPA seen since 2016
WASHINGTON - Civil and criminal crackdowns on polluters dropped sharply in the second year of the Trump administration, according to 2018 enforcement figures released Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Trump administration EPA says the agency is taking a new tack with polluters, giving states more of a role in regulation and enforcement and stressing education and voluntary compliance with offenders as well as fines and criminal prosecution.
The EPA has been one of the most active agencies overall in carrying out the deregulatory goals of President Donald Trump.
Declines include civil investigations carried out by the agency, which fell to 22 last year, down from 40 in 2017 and 125 in 2016, the last year of the Obama administration.
Health exam: President Donald Trump is "in very good health" and expected to remain healthy for "the duration of his Presidency, and beyond," the president's doctor said Friday after a physical exam by 11 specialists. The White House did not release more details and did not say whether any would be released.
Summit location: President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will hold their second summit in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi on Feb. 27-28, the president said Friday night. The president had previously announced Vietnam as the summit location, but the city hadn't been identified.

REVIEW --- All the Fun Has Gone Out of Being a Billionaire

Texto completo: I've been planning to become a billionaire, but I'm starting to change my mind. Being a billionaire doesn't seem so much fun anymore. Honestly, it seems like a real hassle.
Not long ago, people really wanted to be billionaires. We looked at their homes, their other homes, their other other homes, their other other other homes, their planes, their helicopters, their watercraft, their islands, their wine cellars, their underperforming English football teams, their offshore tax havens, their shell companies, their fourth spouses, their unauthorized biographies and thought, Well, that seems pretty cool. I'll try that.
This is not to say there aren't genuine headaches to being a billionaire. Sometimes you forget which of your Gulfstreams you're flying in, and you land in Aspen instead of St. Barts. There's always somebody trying to sell you a castle. You're constantly having to suck up to those weasels who decide the Forbes list. Davos is cold and super boring. And from Bloomberg News, there was just a report on another scourge: rogue corks flying off champagne bottles and damaging fine art on your superyacht.
I hate when that happens.
Then there's this: Every time you buy a new 22-bedroom mansion with a golf course, some party pooper reminds you that Warren Buffett lives in the same house in Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500. I bet that puny Warren Buffett house drives those billionaires nuts.
Still, those complaints are minor compared to what's happening with public sentiment. America's billionaires are on the run.
Look at Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO. A man makes billions with a genius idea: sell people coffee they can buy at the gas station for four times the price. Then he expresses an interest in running for president -- and it's like he's told America that he's secretly been giving them decaf.
Mr. Schultz suspects people are mad at him because he's a billionaire. He doesn't like the way the term "billionaire" has been demonized -- he says he'd prefer the term "people of means," which I guess sounds better than "Renoir sniffers." Mr. Schultz went on "Morning Joe" and got asked to name the price of a box of Cheerios, which he respectfully declined to answer. Everyone knows that Cheerios are $600, "Morning Joe"! Try to come up with something harder next time.
Then there's the billionaire investor Ken Griffin, who's getting ridiculed for buying a Manhattan apartment for $238 million to go along with his $122-million London home, his $60-million Miami penthouse and his $58-million condo in Chicago. Never mind that compared to the $238-million apartment, that $58-million pad in Chicago is probably a real dump.
Of course there's also the Amazon titan Jeff Bezos, who's amid a high-profile divorce and an, um, below-the-belt showdown with the National Enquirer. Mr. Bezos's net worth is close to $140 billion, and a divorce could cut that figure in half. Have you ever tried to live on $70 billion? I bet you start ironing your own shirts. And the butler's shirts.
"Abolish Billionaires," a recent New York Times op-ed declared. That could happen if non-billionaires get their mitts on the tax code. We've all seen the talk about raising the top tax rate for the highest earners to 70%. Seventy percent! I don't blame the billionaires for freaking out. Say you earn $4 billion in a good year. After the proposed top-end tax reform, do you know how much money you will take home? It's 40 bucks.
It's brutal. It's un-American. If we don't start being nicer to our billionaires, it's going to stifle creativity and job creation, and really put a dent in the custom super-luxury yacht business. (What to do with all that fiberglass, make kayaks and bathtubs?)
Really, it's unfair. It's to the point I don't want to be a billionaire anymore. Unless somebody out there wants to give me a billion dollars -- in which case I'll try to tough it out.

Texto completo: [Video: WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? - Official Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
"Let's make the most of this beautiful day": A touching documentary on Mister Rogers airs on HBO and PBS. And the third season of "One Day at a Time" lands on Netflix.
What's on TV
WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO and PBS (check local listings); stream on HBO platforms. Grab those tissues! This portrait of Fred Rogers by the documentarian Morgan Neville ("20 Feet From Stardom") reveals a man who genuinely sought to connect with children. With the help of friends, puppets and guest stars, the host used his quirky TV program "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" to educate youngsters on weighty issues like death, divorce and racism. Neville digs up tear-jerking moments from the show, and reintroduces the man behind Mister Rogers, one who thought children's programs were too violent or condescending and who persevered despite criticism from politicians and skeptics. In addition to this HBO debut, the movie will broadcast on PBS's "Independent Lens" in honor of Mister Rogers's commitment to public programming.
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. A number of celebrities -- including Stevie Wonder, Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga -- have done it. Now it's Halsey's turn. The pop star is serving double-duty as host and musical guest on "S.N.L.," months after the release of her ubiquitous single, "Without Me."
What's Streaming
ONE DAY AT A TIME stream on Netflix. This heartwarming multicamera sitcom, a modern take on Norman Lear's 1970s classic, returns for Season 3. This time around, Penelope (Justina Machado), a single mother, faces tough conversations with her children about sex and drugs and falls for an overprotective father. The format is more traditional than most modern comedy series, and the show -- with Rita Moreno as the matriarch -- still delivers laughs. In her review for The New York Times, Margaret Lyons called the sitcom "energetically political and progressive," one that "radiates delight."
DANIIL TRIFONOV stream live at 8 p.m. on medici.tv. The Grammy Award-winning Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov -- who is yet to turn 30 -- performs works by Beethoven, Schumann and Prokofiev at Carnegie Hall, as part of the venue's Keyboard Virtuosos II series. The Times's chief classical music critic, Anthony Tommasini, said Trifonov was one of the best surprises in the genre in 2018 and called him "a brilliant virtuoso with poetic sensibilities."
DON'T WORRY, HE WON'T GET FAR ON FOOT (2018) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Joaquin Phoenix portrays the irreverent cartoonist John Callahan, who died in 2010, in this biographical drama by Gus Van Sant. The movie picks up when Callahan, an alcoholic, gets into a catastrophic accident that leaves him quadriplegic. He decides it's time for a change and joins Alcoholics Anonymous, where he meets his charming sponsor (Jonah Hill) and discovers a knack for drawing edgy newspaper cartoons.

Texto completo: PRAGUE -- In an attempt to push back against attempts to limit its reach in Europe, the Chinese technology giant Huawei threatened legal action against the Czech Republic if its cybersecurity agency did not rescind its warning about the risk the company poses to the nation's critical infrastructure.
As nations across Europe take the first steps to reconfigure the systems that control the internet, Huawei's threat was the latest salvo in the escalating war over who will control the hardware that will underpin the new 5G, or fifth-generation, networks.
For more than a year, the United States has been engaged in a global campaign aimed at limiting the reach of Chinese telecommunication firms, contending that they pose a threat to security.
While American officials have not offered specific details to support their concerns, they have pointed to China's National Intelligence Law, passed in 2017. They say the law requires Chinese companies to support, provide assistance to and cooperate in Beijing's national intelligence work, wherever they operate.
That law was one of the factors that led the Czech cybersecurity agency, Nukib, to issue a formal warning in December about the risk posed by Huawei and another Chinese technology firm, ZTE.
The warning, which carries the force of law, requires all companies in the Czech Republic that are deemed critical to the nation's health to perform a risk analysis that takes security concerns into account.
It has already led several large companies and government ministries to distance themselves from Huawei, including barring the company from bidding on new projects.
On Friday, the Czech newspaper Dennik N published excerpts from a letter from Huawei to the head of the Czech cyber agency, Dusan Navratil, and Prime Minister Andrej Babis threatening legal action.
"Huawei cannot represent a cybersecurity threat as stated in the warning," the letter said. "Huawei, according to the Chinese law, does not have any obligation to install backdoor or spyware into their products, and the company would never agree to such a request."
Radoslaw Kedzia, Huawei's chief representative in the Czech Republic, wrote that the cyber agency had failed to provide any specific evidence of wrongdoing and failed to explain its analysis of the Chinese law.
"As consequence of the warning, Huawei has already suffered losses and faces many difficulties," he wrote in the letter, dated Feb. 1. "For example, it was excluded from public procurement, even those that do not concern critical infrastructure."
"Retail activities have been harmed and the brand damaged," according to the letter. The company called on Czech officials to rescind the warning, adding that if they did not receive a reply by Feb. 14, they would take the matter to court.
Officials at the cybersecurity agency acknowledged receipt of the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, but declined to comment.
The pushback by Huawei was part of a broader campaign by the company to defend itself across the continent.
Huawei sent a letter to the British Parliament this week defending its track record and claiming that any malicious activity on its part would "destroy its business."
The embattled company, which was founded by a former engineer in China's People's Liberation Army, claimed that the attacks against it were unfounded.
"The governments in some countries have labeled Huawei as a security threat, but they have never substantiated these allegations with solid evidence," Ryan Ding, the president of Huawei's carrier business, wrote in the letter to the British lawmakers.
The United States, Australia and New Zealand have already barred the company from participating in the building of the new 5G networks.
In the coming months, countries across Europe are expected to begin to put in place infrastructure that would allow for the superfast, widely connected networks.
Which companies will lead that effort remains an open question. But as Huawei's threat of legal action demonstrates, the Chinese firm has no intention of ceding the lucrative market.

Books about the Latino, Latinx, and Hispanic experience took several major literary awards recently.
Cuban American author Meg Medina took the Newbery Medal this past January, the highest award given for children's literature for her book "Merci Suárez Changes Gears," making Medina one of a very few Latinx authors who have won the award in its 97 year history.
"Meg Medina's warm and honest novel masterfully depicts one Cuban-American family's life with authenticity and empathy," said Ellen M. Riordan, chair of the Newbery Medal Committee.
The book, which is Medina's seventh, was inspired by her love of bike riding and follows the life of sixth grader Merci Suárez navigating changes in her life during middle school, and also experiences with her extended Cuban-American family.
"I worry for children right now, especially in Latino families, around the issue of immigration," Medina told the weekly trade news magazine Publishers Weekly in a recent interview. Medina added, "We need books that sound and look the way we as Americans look, books that get into the corners of children's experiences."
Award-winning children's author and illustrator Juana Martinez-Neal, who was born and raised in Peru, received a Caldecott honor in January for "Alma and How She Got Her Name."
The book tells the story of Alma Sofia Esperanza José Pura Candela, who discovers the greatness behind her name.
Elizabeth Acevedo's "The Poet X" took the Michael L. Printz Award for excellence in literature written for young adults. She also won the Pura Belpré Award for best book by a Latinx author, and last year won the 2018 National Book Award for Young People's Literature, which was announced this past November.
"The Poet X" tells the story of a young DominicanAmerican girl who discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother's religion and her own relationship to the world.
"For me, my ideal reader was my student, were these young people who struggled with reading, who struggled with finding themselves in literature and would time and again tell me, where are we?" said Acevedo who is also a former teacher during an interview two weeks ago with NPR.
One other award-winning children's books author, Yuyi Morales, who was born in Mexico, won the Pura Belpré Illustrator Award for her book, "Dreamers" a New York Times bestseller where Morales shares her own immigrant experience and her journey from Mexico to the United States with her then two-month-old son.
Morales, who says she is self-taught, was also given a 2015 Caldecott honor for her book "Viva Frida." Morales and Acevedo were among six Latino/a authors who received Pura Belpré honors.
The Newbery, Caldecott, Pura Belpré, and Michael L. Printz, awards are given out every year by the American Library Association and are among the most highly regarded for young adult and children's literature.
Arte Público Press, the largest U.S. publisher of contemporary and recovered literature by U.S. Hispanic authors, was awarded the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Book Critics Circle.
"This recognition will help us amplify voices in Latino literature throughout the United States," said Dr. Nicolás Kanellos, founder and director of Arte Público Press.
The National Books Critics Circle was founded in 1974 and is made of nearly 600 working critics and bookreview editors throughout the country. Each year it hands out awards in six categories which are given annually to a person or institution with an extensive history of significant contributions to book culture.
Two other honorable mentions include National City native Matt de la Peña who won the Newbery Medal in 2016 for his children's book "Last Stop on Market Street," and is also considered the first Latino author to win the award. The other is New York Times bestselling author Pam Muñoz Ryan, who holds a bachelor's and master's degree from San Diego State University, lives near San Diego with her family and received a Newbery Medal honor in 2016 for her book, "Echo," among many other distinguished awards.

Los libros sobre la experiencia latina e hispana obtuvieron varios importantes premios literarios.
La autora cubanaestadounidense Meg Medina ganó la Medalla Newbery hace dos semanas, el premio más alto otorgado a la literatura infantil por su libro "Merci Suárez Changes Gears", que convierte a Medina en una de las pocas autoras latinas que han ganado el premio en sus 97 años de historia.
"La cálida y honesta novela de Meg Medina describe de manera magistral la vida de una familia cubano-estadounidense con autenticidad y empatía", dijo Ellen M. Riordan, presidenta del Comité de la Medalla Newbery.
El libro, el séptimo de Medina, se inspiró en el amor de la autora por andar en bicicleta y sigue la vida de Merci Suárez, de sexto grado, y los cambios en su vida durante la escuela secundaria, y su extensa familia cubana-estadounidense.
"Me preocupo por los niños en este momento, especialmente en las familias latinas, en torno al tema de la inmigración", Medina le dijo a Publishers Weekly la semana pasada y agregó: "Necesitamos libros que suenen y se vean como los estadounidenses nos vemos, libros que llegan a las esquinas. de las experiencias de los niños ".
La galardonada autora e ilustradora infantil Juana Martínez-Neal, quien nació y creció en Perú, recibió el honor de Caldecott en enero por "Alma y cómo recibió su nombre".
El libro cuenta la historia de Alma Sofía Esperanza José Pura Candela que descubre la grandeza detrás de su nombre.

También ganó el Premio Pura Belpré al mejor libro por un autor latinx y el año pasado ganó el Premio Nacional del Libro 2018 para literatura de jóvenes, que se anunció en noviembre pasado.
"El Poeta X" cuenta la historia de una joven dominicana que descubre la poesía de Slam como una forma de entender la religión de su madre y su propia relación con el mundo.
"Para mí, mi lector ideal era mi alumno, eran estos jóvenes que luchaban con la lectura, que luchaban por encontrarse en la literatura y me decían una y otra vez, ¿dónde estamos?", dijo Acevedo, quien también fue profesora durante una entrevista la semana pasada con NPR.
Otra autora galardonada de libros infantiles, Yuyi Morales, quien nació en México, ganó el Premio Pura Belpré Illustrator por su libro, "Dreamers", un libro "best seller" del New York Times en el que Morales comparte su propia experiencia de inmigrante y su viaje desde México hasta Estados Unidos con su hijo de dos meses.
Morales, quien dice que ella misma se enseñó dibujar y escribir libros libros para niños, también recibió un honor Caldecott 2015 por su libro "Viva Frida".

Willie Nelson to play Valentine's Day in El Paso

Texto completo: The iconic Willie Nelson, whose career spans six decades, will bring his concert to the Sun City on Valentine's Day.
The legendary singer, who turned 85 in April, is known not only for his raspy, unmistakable voice and remarkable song writing but also as a businessman, activist and author. His book, "It's A Long Story: My Life," landed him on the New York Times' bestsellers list when it was published in 2015.
Here are five things to know about the singer with braided hair before you head out to the "Willie Nelson & Family" concert at the Abraham Chavez Theatre.
The band is family: So many years traveling on the road, Nelson's band mates are definitely like family. But his grown children are also involved in music, rather playing with their dad in the band or recording on their own.
Daughter Paula Nelson is a singer and a host for Willie's Roadhouse channel (named after her father) on Sirius. Daughter Amy and sons Micah and Lukas, often perform with their dad. Lukas has his own backing band, Promise of the Real.
In 2017, Lukas released an album, "Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real," demonstrating he is coming into his own. He also has dabbled into acting, getting a small part in the 2018 film, "A Star is Born" and helped Bradley Cooper behind the scenes.
His music: Willie Nelson has had 200-plus albums. And he continues to be quite prolific. Last year, he released "Last Man Standing," to celebrate his birthday. It is comprised of songs entirely penned by Nelson and his longtime collaborator Buddy Cannon.
On the album, he mentions friends like Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings and Ray Price and wonders why he is one of the last men still standing.
In September, he also released "My Way," a collection of classics originally made famous by Frank Sinatra, a close friend and musical colleague. In an interview with Harvey Levin's "OBJECTified," Nelson said he often liked to listen to Sinatra to pick up on his phrasing, saying his was scary or not understood by some people.
What he likes to play: Most likely, Nelson will play songs from his new album as well as favorites like "On the Road Again." But he also enjoys singing gospel songs, as he grew up going to a Methodist church and listening to hymns.
He also enjoys playing Sinatra classics, such as his flawless rendition of "My Way."
Vote 'Em Out: Nelson doesn't shy away from taking a stand when needed. And in 2018, he had ties to El Paso with his support of State Rep. Beto O'Rourke. Much bigger than a concert, nearly 55,000 people crammed into the Auditorium Shores in Austin in September for the Turn Out For Texas rally.
O'Rourke joined Nelson to sing "On the Road Again," and the crooner debuted a new song to mark the occasion, "Vote 'Em Out."
"If you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out," he sang. "That's what election day is all about, and the biggest gun we've got is called the ballot box. So if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out."
Cannabis: You can't talk about Nelson without mentioning his affinity for cannabis. In fact, he said in an interview that he once ran back into a burning house to get a good stash of weed and his guitar, Trigger.
In 2015, he launched his own cannabis company, Willie's Reserve, which sells marijuana, accessories and edibles in states where marijuana is legal.
And most recently, he launched Willie's Remedy, a line that includes several items rich in cannaidiol (CBD), a derivative of hemp which won't get the consumer high. CBD has been lauded for its health benefits.
The line debuted with a CBD-infused coffee, a Colombian whole-bean blend.

Texto completo: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos published an explosive letter Thursday accusing National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc. of extortion and blackmail.
In the letter, Bezos accuses the Enquirer and AMI of a plot to publish racy images of Bezos and love interest Lauren Sanchez in exchange for statements saying their investigation into the duo's relationship was not politically motivated.
"Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I’ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten," wrote Bezos in a blog post published on Medium.
Here what you need to know about the battle between Bezos and the Enquirer:
It started with an alleged affair
On January 9, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie announced they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage.
Days later, the Enquirer published a four-month investigation claiming Bezos was in a relationship with Sanchez, a former Fox L. A. TV anchor, citing a series of text messages shared between the two.
More: Jeff Bezos is taking on the National Enquirer. Here's a look at the key players
Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison and had planned to testify before Congress this week as part of special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. Cohen postponed his testimony citing "threats" from the president.
In December, federal prosecutors say AMI admitted paying off an unnamed former Playboy model to suppress publication of her claims of an affair they believed would threaten Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The details were outlined as part of a nonprosecution agreement between the Justice Department and AMI. The filing by prosecutors said Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump, "offered to help deal with negative stories" that could hurt Trump's run for the White House.
Trump and Bezos have history
In his letter, Bezos notes his ownership of The Washington Post as a "complexifier" potentially positioning him as an enemy to powerful people including Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the paper as the "Amazon Washington Post. "
While speaking to Fox host Sean Hannity in an interview in May 2016, Trump said Bezos was using his purchase of The Post to protect Amazon's monopoly, claiming he has "a huge anti-trust problem. "
More recently, Trump mocked Bezos as "Jeff Bozo" in a tweet last month.
In October 2016, during an event hosted by magazine Vanity Fair, Bezos criticized Trump's campaign, saying it "erodes our democracy. " He even joked about sending Trump into space through his aerospace company Blue Origin. "I have a rocket company, so the capability is there. " Bezos later changed his tune, offering his congratulations and "my most open mind" after Trump won the election.
What's the Saudi connection?
Bezos references the Post's coverage of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed inside a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey last year. Although Trump has condemned the murder, he remains close to the Saudi family and has questioned claims from intelligence implicating the Saudis in his murder. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers pushed legislation to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia to hold them accountable for Khashoggi's death.
According to Bezos, a representative from AMI said Pecker was "apoplectic" about the investigation into the Enquirer story. "For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve," said Bezos.
In March 2018, The New York Times published a story claiming Pecker turned to Trump to help cement a relationship with the Saudis to grow his businesses. AMI also published a 97-page magazine that same month in support of Saudi Arabia, which the company allegedly shared with Saudi officials about three weeks before publication, The Associated Press reports.

Eighty-three years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a new plan for tackling income inequality.
FDR argued companies were intensifying the gap between rich and poor not by showering investors with too much wealth—but rather by paying them too little.
"The evil has been a growing one," FDR said in a speech on March 3, 1936. "It has now reached disturbing proportions from the standpoint of the inequality it represents and on its serious effect on the federal revenue."
Companies, then generally taxed at a maximum 13.75%, were squirreling away their earnings rather than distributing them to investors, who were taxed at up to 75%.
That created a "serious two-fold inequality," said FDR: Capital piled up, idle and undertaxed, inside corporations. Meanwhile, "stockholders who need the disbursement of dividends" weren't getting the income they were entitled to.
It was almost the polar opposite of today. This past week, Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Bernie Sanders of Vermont decried what they called "the explosion of stock buybacks."
Their issue: Companies are sending back too much, not too little, money to shareholders.
Companies that repurchase their shares have created "an enormous problem" of "income and wealth inequality," the senators wrote in an editorial in The New York Times, enriching "shareholders and executives, not workers." By transferring assets to investors through buybacks and dividends, corporate managers "restrain their capacity to reinvest profits more meaningfully in the company."
The senators plan to sponsor legislation prohibiting companies from buying back stock unless they pay all employees at least $15 an hour and beef up retirement, health-care and other benefits. The senators also warned that they would "seriously consider" similar limits on dividends, too.
In a buyback, a company uses its cash (or borrows money) to repurchase stock from investors, typically increasing the stock price. During the third quarter of 2018, S&P 500 companies spent $203.8 billion buying back shares, a record for any calendar quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices . Over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, S&P 500 companies spent a record $720.4 billion on repurchases, up 39% over the same period one year earlier.
If companies cut back on buybacks, Sen. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Feb. 4 , they would free up cash for training workers, offering better benefits and investing in new equipment. Those, he said, are "the kinds of things we always thought American corporations would do and now they do scantily when compared to how much they do in terms of buybacks."
At the heart of the recent criticism is the belief that companies can best sustain innovation and reduce inequality by retaining most of their capital rather than paying it out to investors.
To be sure, as I've often pointed out , such payouts can be problematic. Companies tend to buy their shares back most eagerly at the worst possible times . Also, by counteracting the dilution from new shares issued to managers exercising stock options, buybacks can placate investors who might otherwise toss out overpaid and underperforming bosses.
Overall, however, buybacks (and dividends) return excess capital to investors who are free to spend or reinvest it wherever it is most needed.
By requiring companies to hang onto their capital instead of paying it out, Congress might—perhaps—encourage them to invest more in workers and communities.
But the law most likely to govern here is the Law of Unintended Consequences.
The history of investment by corporate managers with oodles of cash on their hands isn't encouraging . Hugh Liedtke, the late chief executive of Pennzoil, reportedly liked to quip that he believed in " the bladder theory ": Companies should pay out as much cash as possible, so managers couldn't piss all the money away.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, giant oil companies, flush with dollars after the boom in oil prices, binged on buying department stores and developing electric typewriters . (Montgomery Ward stores and Qyx typewriters didn't turn out to be gushers.)
In the late 1990s, most technology startups refused to pay dividends, instead plowing all their cash back into the business. Employees got free massages, dentists on call, mobile gyms, stock options and other great benefits —until many of the companies went bust, leaving workers and investors alike in the lurch.
Today, some of the companies that have bought back the greatest proportion of their shares—Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., for example—also score highest on rankings of how they treat employees.
Complex problems seldom have simple solutions, as even FDR discovered.
After the stock-market crash, dividends had fallen 55% between 1929 and 1933. The investment analyst Benjamin Graham estimated that in 1934 fewer than one-third of New York Stock Exchange companies had repurchased shares.
"The grotesque result," Graham wrote, was that "the typical stockholder is weighed down by financial problems while the corporation wallows in cash."
That, and FDR's calls to free up corporate cash, prompted Congress to enact an undistributed profits tax, penalizing companies for not maximizing their payouts to shareholders.
The undistributed profits tax did prod companies into raising dividends by approximately 25%, but it also led to so much corporate tax avoidance that Congress unwound it in 1938.

All the Fun Has Gone Out of Being a Billionaire; From Bezos to Schultz, America's richest are having an unusually tough time in the public eye. It almost doesn't seem worth it—almost.

Texto completo: PHOTO: Ross MacDonald
I've been planning to become a billionaire, but I'm starting to change my mind. Being a billionaire doesn't seem so much fun anymore. Honestly, it seems like a real hassle.
Not long ago, people really wanted to be billionaires. We looked at their homes, their other homes, their other other homes, their other other other homes, their planes, their helicopters, their watercraft, their islands, their wine cellars, their underperforming English football teams, their offshore tax havens, their shell companies, their fourth spouses, their unauthorized biographies and thought, Well, that seems pretty cool. I'll try that.
This is not to say there aren't genuine headaches to being a billionaire. Sometimes you forget which of your Gulfstreams you're flying in, and you land in Aspen instead of St. Barts. There's always somebody trying to sell you a castle. You're constantly having to suck up to those weasels who decide the Forbes list. Davos is cold and super boring. And from Bloomberg News, there was just a report on another scourge: rogue corks flying off champagne bottles and damaging fine art on your superyacht.
I hate when that happens.
Then there's this: Every time you buy a new 22-bedroom mansion with a golf course, some party pooper reminds you that Warren Buffett lives in the same house in Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500. I bet that puny Warren Buffett house drives those billionaires nuts.
Still, those complaints are minor compared to what's happening with public sentiment. America's billionaires are on the run.
Look at Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO. A man makes billions with a genius idea: sell people coffee they can buy at the gas station for four times the price. Then he expresses an interest in running for president—and it's like he's told America that he's secretly been giving them decaf.
Mr. Schultz suspects people are mad at him because he's a billionaire. He doesn't like the way the term "billionaire" has been demonized—he says he'd prefer the term "people of means," which I guess sounds better than "Renoir sniffers." Mr. Schultz went on "Morning Joe" and got asked to name the price of a box of Cheerios, which he respectfully declined to answer. Everyone knows that Cheerios are $600, "Morning Joe"! Try to come up with something harder next time.
Then there's the billionaire investor Ken Griffin, who's getting ridiculed for buying a Manhattan apartment for $238 million to go along with his $122-million London home, his $60-million Miami penthouse and his $58-million condo in Chicago. Never mind that compared to the $238-million apartment, that $58-million pad in Chicago is probably a real dump.
Of course there's also the Amazon titan Jeff Bezos, who's amid a high-profile divorce and an, um, below-the-belt showdown with the National Enquirer. Mr. Bezos's net worth is close to $140 billion, and a divorce could cut that figure in half. Have you ever tried to live on $70 billion? I bet you start ironing your own shirts. And the butler's shirts.
"Abolish Billionaires," a recent New York Times op-ed declared. That could happen if non-billionaires get their mitts on the tax code. We've all seen the talk about raising the top tax rate for the highest earners to 70%. Seventy percent! I don't blame the billionaires for freaking out. Say you earn $4 billion in a good year. After the proposed top-end tax reform, do you know how much money you will take home? It's 40 bucks.
It's brutal. It's un-American. If we don't start being nicer to our billionaires, it's going to stifle creativity and job creation, and really put a dent in the custom super-luxury yacht business. (What to do with all that fiberglass, make kayaks and bathtubs?)
Really, it's unfair. It's to the point I don't want to be a billionaire anymore. Unless somebody out there wants to give me a billion dollars—in which case I'll try to tough it out.

Texto completo: Ariana Grande is speaking out after a Grammys producer said the singer wasn't performing at the Sunday night show because she "felt it was too late for her to pull something together. "
After Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich told The Associated Press that Grande said it was too late for her to adequately prepare, Grande refuted that claim on social media.
After sharing a screenshot of an article including Ehrlich's comments, Grande wrote on Twitter: "i’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me. i can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. it was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. i hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more. "
She continued: "i offered 3 different songs. it’s about collaboration. it’s about feeling supported. it’s about art and honesty. not politics. not doing favors or playing games. it’s just a game y’all. . and i’m sorry but that’s not what music is to me. "

The 2019 Grammys will broadcast live from Los Angeles' Staples Center Sunday on CBS at 8 EST/5 PST. Ehrlich told the New York Times that Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino all declined offers to perform in the show.
In Ehrlich's AP chat, he said the show had multiple conversations with Grande about the possibility of appearing. He said the Recording Academy wanted her to perform after having "conversations over the past month or so" and by the time it seemed like a performance might work out, Grande said it was too late to prepare.
Who won't be there: Will these stars skip the 2019 Grammys? Why Beyonce, Taylor Swift and Drake may not show
Variety reported this week that the singer had a disagreement with Grammy producers on which songs she would perform, so she pulled out.
Grande is nominated for two awards and said she's "still grateful for the acknowledgement this year," though she didn't receive the number of Grammy nominations many fans hoped, with her "Sweetener" album snubbed in the night's biggest categories.

The last time Grande attended the Grammys was in 2016, skipping the 2017 awards despite receiving two nominations. She wasn't nominated for any awards in 2018.
Grande does have an album dropping Grammys weekend, with "Thank U, Next" arriving Friday.
Review: Ariana Grande's 'thank u, next' is her best, most confessional album yet
Reaction: Twitter praises Ariana Grande's new album 'thank u, next': 'An album of 12 unskippable songs'
Grande has been featured on billboards promoting Sunday's show, and the irony wasn't lost on the singer as she was ranting on Twitter about her decision not to perform being miscast – noting that she passed a bus sporting a Grammys ad with her face as she was typing.
The pop star's mother, Joan Grande, also chimed in on Twitter.
"I agree with you Ariana," she said, and called the Grammys ad campaign "exploitive" for featuring her daughter's face even though she was never a confirmed performer.

Woody Allen Sues Amazon On Contract

Texto completo: Filmmaker Woody Allen sued Amazon Studios, claiming breach of contract for refusing to distribute his most recent movie, "A Rainy Day in New York," and terminating a four-picture production and distribution deal without cause.
In a suit filed Thursday in federal court in the Southern District of New York seeking more than $68 million in damages, Mr. Allen said Amazon backed out of his deal last June after an old accusation that the director and actor had molested his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, in 1992 resurfaced as the #MeToo movement was gathering steam.
"Amazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year-old baseless allegation against Mr. Allen, but that allegation was already well-known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr. Allen -- and in any event, it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract," the suit said.
In recent years, Ms. Farrow has become more vocal about her accusation against Mr. Allen and in a 2014 New York Times piece criticized those who have worked with him.
Mr. Allen has continued to deny the accusation by Ms. Farrow and her mother, Mia Farrow, who was his longtime partner. Mr. Allen was investigated by the Connecticut State Attorney but wasn't charged.
Mr. Allen's suit alleges that cracks in his relationship with Amazon started to appear in late 2017 after Roy Price resigned as president of Amazon Studios in the wake of harassment allegations made against him by a producer on an Amazon show. Mr. Price was also under fire for his business ties to movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault. Both Messrs. Price and Weinstein have disputed those allegations.
In the suit, Mr. Allen said Amazon executives reached out to his representatives in December 2017 "and discussed the negative publicity and reputation harm Amazon Studios had received because of allegations" made against Mr. Price and its association with Mr. Weinstein. An agreement was reached to push the release of "A Rainy Day in New York" to 2019 from 2018.
However, last June, Amazon Studios Associate General Counsel Ajay Patel emailed Mr. Allen's representatives a termination notice. Amazon, the suit said, didn't provide any "legal or factual basis" for the termination.
"I don't know whether you'd call this hubris or just shortsightedness on Amazon's part -- but this is clearly not an acceptable way to behave in the business world," said Mr. Allen's attorney, John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.
Pressed by Mr. Allen's camp as to why the deal was terminated, Amazon's Mr. Patel said it had become "untenable" because of "supervening events, including renewed allegations against Mr. Allen, his own controversial comments, and the increasing refusal of top talent to work with or be associated with him in any way, all of which have frustrated the purpose of the agreement," according to the suit.
Amazon, the suit said, didn't respond to Mr. Allen's request to explain what it was referring to by "renewed allegations," "controversial comments" and "top talent."
An Amazon Studios spokeswoman declined to comment. Amazon Studios is a unit of Amazon.com Inc.
Under the terms of the deal outlined in the suit, Amazon agreed to pay Mr. Allen's Gravier Productions a minimum guarantee of $9 million a movie as well as distribute them in major-market theaters in the U.S. for 90 days and a minimum of 500 screens.

Democrats Begin Push to Secure President's Tax Returns

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Democrats took the first cautious steps on Thursday in their quest to obtain President Trump's long-hidden tax returns, further inflaming the contentious relationship between the president and the newly empowered House.
A fractious afternoon hearing of a Ways and Means oversight subcommittee was intended to begin building a case that Mr. Trump's withholding of his returns was not only flouting modern political norms but also potentially hiding violations of federal tax laws and compromising the interests of the United States. Democrats argued that they had the legal authority and good cause to invoke an obscure provision in the federal code that gives the committee's chairman access to private tax information to find the answers and potentially inform other related inquiries into Mr. Trump's financial positions.
"We are not interested in getting someone," Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said during one exchange. "We are interested in following the law, period."
The Democratic lawmakers faced stiff objections from congressional Republicans, who accused them of seeking to violate Mr. Trump's privacy, setting a dangerous precedent for political retribution and abusing the power laid out in the law. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had said the House's multiplying inquiries into him, his business and his administration constituted "presidential harassment."
"The Dems and their committees are going 'nuts,"' he wrote on Twitter.
Tensions have also simmered between Democratic leaders who want to proceed slowly and liberals who think they are wasting time. But by the time the gavel fell in the Ways and Means hearing room, the Democrats had already made clear they were undeterred.
"Overwhelmingly, the public wants to see the president's tax returns," said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. "They want to know the truth. They want to know the facts. And he has nothing to hide."
What comes next is far less clear. The statute in question -- Section 6103 of the federal tax code -- gives the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee extraordinary powers to request that the Treasury Department release to him tax information on any filer, including the president. The provision allows the committee to review the tax information privately, but it would have to vote to disclose any return information or findings to the public.
There is scant precedent for its use to investigate an individual, much less someone of Mr. Trump's stature. That and an all but certain legal challenge from the administration will most likely leave the outcome to the federal courts.
The tax policy experts assembled by the committee generally supported Democrats' view of the law, arguing that Section 6103 gave the chairman wide discretion as long as he could show a "legitimate purpose" for obtaining sensitive records.
"Congress in effect placed tax return information in a locked safe in 1976, but it preserved one key for purposes of disclosing such information to the public," said George K. Yin, a University of Virginia tax law professor. "It gave that key to the tax committees. The law therefore should be interpreted to enable the tax committees to use the key in appropriate and necessary circumstances."
Only one of the panelists, Ken Kies, a former Ways and Means aide and veteran Republican tax lobbyist, disagreed.
The committee's chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, is working closely with the House's general counsel, Doug Letter, to build a legal rationale that could withstand a court challenge. Mr. Neal, who prides himself more on his bipartisan policymaking skills than hard-nosed partisan oversight, is reluctant to move too quickly and risk making a mistake that could be exploited in court, people familiar with his thinking said.
Though it focused almost exclusively on invoking existing authorities, for instance, Thursday's subcommittee hearing was technically a legislative session concentrated on a portion of Democrats' broad election reform bill that would require all presidents and vice presidents to disclose their tax returns going forward.
But pressure from Mr. Neal's left flank is growing. Three liberal groups -- Tax March, Stand Up America and Indivisible -- recently wrote a letter urging the chairman to "stop slow-walking" and even attached another form letter, addressed to the Treasury secretary and the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, for Mr. Neal to sign formally requesting the returns. Liberal lawmakers, too, are growing impatient.
Mr. Neal has not indicated when he plans to make a formal request under the law, how he would review what he got or if his committee or others will convene additional hearings first. Nor has he said whether he will request tax information on the Trump Organization or just the president's personal returns.
As written, the law does not give the Trump administration clear grounds to deny a request from Mr. Neal. It says only that the Treasury secretary "shall" furnish the information upon request.
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said he will comply with all legal requests from Congress for the tax returns of any taxpayer, including Mr. Trump. However, Treasury officials are preparing to challenge the legitimacy of any requests coming from the committee that they could argue are political in nature and not related to real legislative work.
Republicans forcefully defended Mr. Trump, beginning with a letter from the committee's ranking member, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, early Thursday urging Mr. Neal to reconsider "weaponizing the nation's tax code" for political purposes.
"This isn't about the tax returns of presidents and vice presidents but about making sure Congress does not abuse its authority," he wrote. "This is about protecting the private tax returns of every American."
In the hearing room, Republicans tried out various arguments. The current law does not actually require presidents or candidates to release their tax information, they pointed out. Representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the oversight subcommittee, said a committee review would be redundant since the I.R.S. is mandated to audit all presidential returns. Representative Brad Wenstrup, Republican of Ohio, compared requiring candidates to release their tax returns to asking them to make their medical records public.
"Where does it end?" Mr. Kelly asked. "What about the tax returns of the speaker? Members of Congress? Federal employees? Or, for that matter, any political donors? There is no end in sight for those whose tax information may be in jeopardy."
Democrats called that argument ridiculous. They said their case was about a specific president who had defied norms and was known to have complicated financial entanglements. They also pointed to reports in The New York Times and other news media outlets that suggested that Mr. Trump had substantially misled the public about certain aspects of his wealth.
Mr. Trump is the first president or major party nominee to refuse to release his personal tax returns since doing so became the norm in the 1970s. During the campaign, he cited a continuing I.R.S. audit of his returns, but since taking office, the White House has signaled that Mr. Trump has no intentions of making the material public regardless of an audit.

Chain Beats
Expectations
Chipotle Mexican GrillInc.'s menu changes and restaurant investments helped drive better-than-expected sales and margins in the latest period, showing the company is continuing to move past food-safety scares that eroded customers' trust.
Chipotle, which reported a 4% comparable-sales increase in 2018, expects the key sales metric to improve 4% to 6% this year. Analysts forecast a 4.4% rise this year.
Overall, Chipotle reported a fourth-quarter profit of $32 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with a profit of $43.8 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, profit was $1.72 a share, ahead of the $1.40 a share expected from analysts surveyed by FactSet. Sales rose 10% to $1.23 billion.

DAIMLER
Auto Maker Cuts
Bonuses, Dividend
Daimler AG lowered employee bonuses and cut its dividend for the first time in years, after profit dropped by almost a third in 2018, hit by trade tensions, emissions issues and increased investment in future technologies.
Daimler lowered its dividend for the 2018 financial year to 3.25 euros ($3.69) from 3.65 euros, the first such cut since 2009.
Daimler's 2018 net profit dropped to 7.25 billion euros ($8.27 billion) from 10.28 billion euros. Earnings before interest and taxes dropped 22% to 11.13 billion euros. Profit took a 774 million euros hit from currency fluctuations and a charge of about 500 million euros from higher raw-materials costs. Revenue rose 2% to 167.4 billion euros.

PUBLICIS GROUPE
Sales Are Hit by
Lower Ad Spending
Publicis Groupe SA said cutbacks in ad spending from consumer-goods companies in the U.S. weighed on its sales in the fourth quarter, but the French advertising giant is banking on recent new business wins to buoy its performance in 2019.
The owner of agencies Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett, and Starcom Mediavest Group said sales in the three months ended Dec. 31 fell 0.3% from a year earlier on an organic basis -- a key industry measure of the company's performance that strips out currency effects and acquisitions -- to 2.49 billion euros ($2.85 billion). Analysts had expected a rise of 2.5%.

NEW YORK TIMES
Big Gain in Digital
Subscribers Posted
New York Times Co. added 265,000 digital subscribers in the fourth quarter, its largest gain since the period immediately following the 2016 presidential election, as the company set an ambitious target of 10 million paying customers by 2025.
The publisher reported net income of $55.2 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $56.8 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier, when results were hurt in part by a pension settlement and a tax-related charge.
The Times said it ended the quarter with 3.4 million digital customers, with 2.7 million paying for the news product and the rest subscribing to the lower-cost cooking and crossword apps. Including print subscribers, the Times counted 4.3 million paying customers at the end of 2018.

They Came First. Then the Egg

Texto completo: When Chris Godfrey learned in early January that the record for "likes" on an Instagram post was held by the celebrity and businesswoman Kylie Jenner, he took it as a challenge. He remembers thinking: "Could something as universal and simple as an egg be great enough to beat that record?"
It could! Just nine days after the thought, that record was cracked. Mr. Godfrey had beaten Ms. Jenner's post about her infant daughter with a simple picture of an egg. The original egg post now has more than 52 million likes -- her post is shy of 19 million -- and the egg's account now has more than 10 million followers.
Why an egg? Mr. Godfrey explained: "An egg has no gender, race or religion. An egg is an egg, it's universal."
Mr. Godfrey, a 29-year-old advertising creative who works at the & Partnership in London, and the two friends he has enlisted to help him with the account have now delivered their second act. It is a commercial produced with and aired on the streaming service Hulu, timed to take advantage of the annual Super Bowl ad extravaganza. In it, the egg shares a story about how going viral has affected its mental health.
"The pressure of social media is getting to me," the egg discloses in the commercial, after introducing itself. "If you're struggling, too, talk to someone."
The ad then directs viewers to the website for the nonprofit Mental Health America. The creators say that mental health is the first of several causes that the egg -- which they and their fans call Eugene -- will come to stand for.
"People have fallen in love with this egg, and Eugene the egg wants to continue to spread positive messages," said Alissa Khan-Whelan, 26, one of the friends working with Mr. Godfrey.
After the birth of the egg on Jan. 4, Mr. Godfrey stayed anonymous. But he, Ms. Khan-Whelan and another friend, C.J. Brown, 29, agreed to speak to The New York Times to tell their story and explain their intentions.
"We felt that the time was right to come out," Ms. Khan-Whelan said. "We can put any speculation to bed."
There has been a lot of puzzlement about how a picture of an egg created an Instagram frenzy. Some speculated that the account's creator had paid influencers to spread the word. Others even took credit for growing the egg's audience.
Mr. Godfrey says that such claims are untrue and that the account's growth was "completely organic." No one person helped the egg's rise in popularity and no single account or group of accounts helped it to explode.
They did note a demographic that embraced the egg immediately.
"I think it was perhaps the younger generation," Mr. Godfrey said. "In the schools and stuff, it started to spread. It sort of spread through playgrounds." He noticed that interactions with young people would peak between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, "when school was out."
Ms. Khan-Whelan recalled seeing "amazing videos of kids in their class going 'Miss, miss, have you liked the egg?"'
Marketers agreed that the youth had been key to the egg's success. (Instagram technically requires users to be 13 to create an account, but that rule is often disregarded.) Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer of the agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners, only became aware of the egg account after realizing that her 12-year-old son had liked the image. She then sought out more information about it.
"What a great thing for them to do and kind of hijack the Super Bowl through social, and hammer home a responsible message," she said.
The egg's audience was also amplified by Mr. Godfrey's decision to incorporate user-generated content into the account's Instagram stories, where posts expire after 24 hours. The egg's main Instagram feed stayed spare and mysterious, while Mr. Godfrey shouted out followers in its stories, helping to infect his growing audience with a sense of team spirit. (The hashtag #EggGang was quickly adapted to describe the account's fans.)
"In its infancy, it was one of those ridiculous things, like, 'Oh, we're trying to break this world record by just liking this random image,"' said Sam Shepherd, an executive creative director at the digital agency 360i.
That agency won industry praise in 2013 when it worked with Oreo to quickly tweet "You can still dunk in the dark" during an unexpected blackout at the Super Bowl. Mr. Shepherd described the egg's next act as the 2019 version of that stunt.
The team behind the egg declined to talk about the money it has been offered or the big names it has come into contact with, preferring to keep the attention focused on Eugene. (Asked about one marketer's claim that partnering with the account would be worth at least $10 million, Ms. Khan-Whelan said only that the number was "greatly exaggerated.")
It is true, though, that building an entity -- really, a platform on a platform -- that reaches millions of people brings financial benefit. The egg team is being paid by Hulu. It said that Nick Tran, Hulu's vice president of brand marketing and culture, pursued the opportunity, and that he was introduced to them though The Times, a new agency in Chicago created by the Instagram enthusiast Jason Peterson. It would not disclose what it was paid.
"Dollars always follow eyeballs," said Andrew Essex, chief executive and founder of Plan A, a creative holding company. For the creators, the account's success was "basically a license to print money," he said.
Mr. Godfrey, Mr. Brown and Ms. Khan-Whelan say they are less interested in money than in promoting positivity.
"We've had plenty of amazing offers and opportunities that have come on to the table," Ms. Khan-Whelan said. "So many. We've not really been sharing details because we don't think this is about us. This is about Eugene the egg and what the egg can do."
Mr. Godfrey would not comment on what the last few weeks had been like, other than to say it had been "crazy" and "a real journey." (He, Mr. Brown and Ms. Khan-Whelan have essentially been living together, in South East London, for that time.)
"It's not really about me," he insisted. "It's just about the egg and sort of where we can take it and what we can do with it."
They would not comment on the causes they will support beyond mental health, saying that they would take each day as it comes. They plan to remain highly responsive to their audience.
"The fact that they were able to get a lot of people to look at a picture of the egg -- it was the ultimate anomaly, just a complete freak event," Mr. Essex said. "A tear in the time-space continuum. It doesn't make much sense, but it's not going to continue. Every once in a while something comes out of the blue and breaks the internet for no reason. This is the quintessential fluke. It's not replicable. It's not replicable and it's not sustainable. With all due respect."
(Asked to whom the respect was due, he clarified: "To the egg people.")
The egg people are not dissuaded. They have heard from fans in Azerbaijan and Dubai. They are particularly popular in the United States, which is one of the reasons they decided to do a Super Bowl ad.
"It's a dream to put that in the same sentence that we're doing something in relation to the Super Bowl -- it feels really special," Ms. Khan-Whelan said. "Michael Jackson performed at halftime, and now Eugene is center stage."
Mr. Godfrey said the team sees the Super Bowl as more than just an American event but rather as "an international moment."
"Eugene is global, Eugene is really global all over the world," Ms. Khan-Whelan said. "He likes football. Or she, sorry. Or it."
Asked to respond to Mr. Essex, Mr. Godfrey did agree that the egg's success had been a fluke.
"But it's a fluke that caught the world's attention," he said. "It's what you do with that attention that counts."

Texto completo: Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson is facing accusations that she plagiarized passages of her new book about the media industry.
Vice News correspondent Michael Moynihan on Wednesday evening tweeted a series of passages from Ms. Abramson's new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," which appeared nearly verbatim in previous publications, including the New Yorker and Time Out.
In his tweets, Mr. Moynihan called attention to a passage from the book describing a column by Gavin McInnes, one of the co-founders of Vice, about young liberals. Ms. Abramson's description mirrors a passage from a student publication called the Ryerson Review of Journalism nearly word for word, with slight differences from the structure of the original sentences.
Another of Mr. Moynihan's tweets cited a passage from Ms. Abramson's book describing former Vice executive Jason Mojica that reads almost exactly the same as an article from Time Out.
The Wall Street Journal reviewed the passages in question and confirmed their similarity.
Ms. Abramson didn't credit either publication in the text of her book, though the manuscript contains extensive footnotes. Some of the pieces that Mr. Moynihan alluded to, including the New Yorker's, were mentioned at some point in the book footnotes but didn't directly refer to the passages in question.
In an emailed statement, Ms. Abramson said she sought to give proper attribution to all her sources, noting the book has 70 pages of footnotes, but acknowledged mistakes.
"The language is too close in some cases and should have been cited as quotations in the text," she said. "All of the ideas in the book are original, all the opinions are mine. The passages in question involve facts that should have been perfectly cited in my footnotes and weren't."
"I was up all night going through my book because I take these claims of plagiarism so seriously," Ms. Abramson said.
Ms. Abramson's book, which scrutinizes the business models of the New York Times, Washington Post, BuzzFeed and Vice Media, has landed in a media industry riven by turmoil. BuzzFeed and Vice Media both announced plans to lay off journalists in recent weeks, part of their efforts to become profitable amid industrywide challenges to their business models.
Ms. Abramson was executive editor at the New York Times from 2011 to 2014. Her tenure ended when she was ousted from the newspaper by then-Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., who appointed current editor Dean Baquet to succeed her. Earlier in her career, Ms. Abramson worked at the Journal.
Before she was accused of plagiarism, Ms. Abramson faced scrutiny in recent weeks from journalists who said her manuscript contained errors and mischaracterizations.
Arielle Duhaime-Ross, a correspondent at Vice News Tonight, said on Twitter that a galley of Ms. Abramson's book incorrectly identified her as transgender, mischaracterized her professional qualifications and incorrectly described the color of her boots.
Ms. Abramson said on Twitter last month that early photos from her book were from uncorrected galleys.
The book was published Feb. 5 by CBS Corp.'s Simon & Schuster publishing arm.
Simon & Schuster called Ms. Abramson's book "exhaustively researched and meticulously sourced" in a statement Wednesday, adding that it stood ready to make revisions if they were deemed necessary.

Texto completo: Three women have accused Óscar Arias Sánchez, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his work to resolve armed conflicts in Central America, of sexual misconduct, including one woman who filed a criminal complaint.
Costa Rica's federal prosecutor's office said a sex-crimes complaint was lodged on Monday against Mr. Arias, 78 years old, who served two terms as president of Costa Rica. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor declined to identify the accuser or provide any details about the allegations, citing privacy laws.
An attorney for Mr. Arias declined to comment on the complaint, citing privacy laws that apply to the initial phases of a sexual-assault allegation.
In a statement to a local newspaper, Mr. Arias denied the charges and said he would defend himself in court. Mr. Arias was quoted by the Semanario Universidad as saying he "would never have acted disrespecting the will of any woman."
Local media reports said the woman who brought the criminal complaint is a physician and activist who visited Mr. Arias's house to discuss an antinuclear campaign. The New York Times identified her as Alexandra Arce von Herold, now 34, a Costa Rican psychiatrist.
Ms. Arce didn't return phone calls or text messages to a mobile phone that contacts said was hers. The Times quoted Ms. Arce as saying Mr. Arias grabbed her from behind, fondled her breasts and sexually penetrated her with his fingers.
After news reports about the criminal complaint, two other women aired accusations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Arias to reporters.
Emma Daly, the head of global communications for Human Rights Watch, told The Wall Street Journal that in 1990, while she was covering his conflict-resolution work as a journalist, Mr. Arias groped her breasts in a hotel lobby. Another woman, Eleonora Antillón, a former adviser to Mr. Arias, told The Journal he sexually assaulted her in 1980.
Mr. Ramos, the attorney for Mr. Arias, declined to comment on either woman's account.
Ms. Daly said that while interviewing Mr. Arias in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel in Managua, Nicaragua, she asked him a question and he responded by running his hand down her chest and saying, "You're not wearing a bra."
She said that the alleged behavior described in the criminal complaint filed Monday against Mr. Arias "seems to me to be much more severe, but I see it as on the same continuum of bad behavior" as what happened to her.
"I'm not at professional or personal risk of speaking out, and so many women are, so I felt it was my duty to say something," said Ms. Daly, who was about 25 at the time. "Holding powerful people to account is a big part of my professional work."
Ms. Antillón, now 60, worked briefly as a campaign adviser to Mr. Arias. At their first meeting, at a restaurant over dinner and wine, Mr. Arias put his hand on her leg and tried to kiss her, she said. When she asked what he was doing, he said, "It's so we can trust each other," Ms. Antillón recounted.
A few days later, Mr. Arias invited her to a private meeting in his office, and when she arrived, he rose from his desk, approached her, and put her hand on his penis, Ms. Antillón said. When she resisted, he pushed her into a wardrobe and began forcibly kissing her and again placed her hand on his genitals, she said.
The sound of furniture moving in the room attracted attention, and Mr. Arias ended the encounter when an aide knocked on the door, she said. Ms. Antillón left the office and avoided one-on-one meetings with Mr. Arias for the rest of her time working for him, she said.
She said she mentioned the incident to a few friends and stopped working for Mr. Arias a few months later, returning to what became a successful 40-year career as a television and radio presenter. Mr. Arias successfully ran for president in 1986.
"This was more than 35 years ago, and in Costa Rica, it just wasn't a custom to denounce someone for sexual abuse or harassment," Ms. Antillón said. "In those days, women were taught to be obedient to men. It didn't even occur to me to act in my own self-defense. I felt an intense sense of rage and impotence, but the first questions that came to my mind were, what did I do to provoke this?"

Texto completo: New York Times Co. added 265,000 digital subscribers in the fourth quarter, its largest gain since the period immediately following the 2016 presidential election, as the company set an ambitious target of 10 million paying customers by 2025.
The publisher reported net income of $55.2 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $56.8 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier, when results were hurt in part by a pension settlement and a tax-related charge.
The Times said it ended the quarter with 3.4 million digital customers, with 2.7 million paying for the news product and the rest subscribing to the lower-cost cooking and crossword apps. Including print subscribers, the Times counted 4.3 million paying customers at the end of 2018.
New York Times shares were up 10% at $29.69 on Wednesday.
The company boosted its marketing efforts to acquire new subscribers, resulting in a nearly 50% jump in marketing spending. That contributed to operating costs rising 8% in the quarter to $426.7 million, and the Times predicted operating costs would grow 10% in the first quarter from a year earlier, primarily due to increased marketing costs.
The publisher also said average revenue per user declined 3.5% from a year earlier, largely driven by the number of subscribers taking advantage of a $1-a-week promotional offer and predicted that would continue in 2019. The Times doesn't count promotional subscribers in its overall paying-customer count.
The company's chief executive, Mark Thompson, said in a call with analysts that the company would begin experimenting with increasing the price of digital subscriptions for the first time since introducing a paywall in 2011.
In all, the company recorded $502.7 million in revenue, a 3.8% gain compared with the year-earlier quarter. That was driven by 5% growth in total advertising revenue and a 23% rise in digital advertising revenue. It marked the first time ever that digital ad revenue surpassed print ad revenue at the Times.
Subscription revenue fell 2.2% quarter-on-quarter, despite a 9.3% rise in digital subscription revenue. That was due in part to the fact that the fourth quarter of 2017 had an additional week. When adjusting for that, total revenue rose 10%, while advertising revenue increased 11% and subscription revenue gained 5%.
The Times said it ended 2018 with $709 million in total digital revenue, approaching its target of $800 million by 2020.
"As a result we are setting ourselves a new goal—to grow our subscription business to more than 10 million subscriptions by 2025," Mr.Thompson said.
To meet that goal, the Times would need to add an average of 204,000 news subscribers per quarter through the end of 2025, a number the company has only achieved four times in the last 12 quarters.
Last year, Mr. Thompson said the company added 120 reporters, bringing the Times to an all-time high of 1,600 journalists, and planned to continue adding more as part of the effort to reach its 2025 subscriber goal. The Times said approximately 16% of its digital subscribers are outside of the U.S.
The company also said it was looking to create a separate parenting app—which it plans to make available in beta testing later this year—and was considering additional subscriber products.
The company also said it would raise it dividend by 1 cent to 5 cents a share.

Don’t make ‘Medicare for all’ a litmus test

Texto completo: Hear that crunching sound? It’s the eggshells that 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are stomping through, backing up and stomping upon all over again, as they attempt to satisfy the base’s delicate demands for Medicare-for-all.
The left-wing die-hards sometimes argue that supporting Medicare-for-all should be a litmus test for anyone seeking the 2020 nomination because it’s not only good policy but good politics, too. The entrenched establishment may claim it’s a "radical" idea, but surveys suggest it is mainstream.
"If I look at polling and 70 percent of the people support Medicare for All, if a very significant percentage of people think the rich, the very rich, should start paying their fair share of taxes," Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, told The New York Times, "I think I’d be pretty dumb not to develop policies that capture what the American people want."
In a sense, Sanders is right: The phrase "Medicare-for-all" polls favorably (though not always at 70 percent), and has for several years.
Here’s the problem. The things Americans are apparently envisioning when they tell pollsters they support Medicare-for-all turn out to be a different, vaguer and more varied set of ideas than the specific thing that Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and others in the progressive base are proposing.
Sanders, et al. want all Americans enrolled in a single, generous, government-run — or single-payer — plan with no private insurers offering their own similar, competing policies. Sanders said he envisions the role of private insurers only for "cosmetic surgery, you want to get your nose fixed." (To be clear, this is not how Medicare currently works; the program relies heavily on privately run insurance plans.) How does the public feel about this?
If you simply ask, "Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all?," 56 percent of respondents favor it, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll.
But mention that Medicare-for-all involves getting rid of private insurance companies, and support plummets to 37 percent. Which should not be that surprising. Most adults have private insurance, and most of them like it. They’re nervous about losing it.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris, a California Democrat, learned this the hard way, when the presidential candidate spelled out during a CNN town hall last week that she favored eliminating private insurance.
After a backlash, Harris’s staff walked back her comments, noting that she preferred Sanders-style single-payer but had also co-sponsored other bills that allowed existing private insurance plans to coexist alongside expanded public insurance. That, in turn, inflamed the left. A former Sanders staffer said it was equivalent to saying "you’re OK with people dying for being too poor."
Wary of provoking the single-payer-or-bust-ers, other Democratic 2020 candidates have given incoherent or noncommittal remarks on the subject. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said he supported "single-payer" but also the use of private insurers, eventually endorsing "Medicare for all who want it." Sen. Cory Booker (a New Jerse Democrat) confusingly said he supported the continued existence of "private health care," which might mean insurers but also might simply mean providers.
Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachussetts, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York — who, like Harris and Booker, co-sponsored Sanders’ single-payer bill — have both sidestepped the issue. Asked about private insurance, Warren said last week there were a lot of paths to get to "affordable health care for every American."
And you know what? That’s the right answer right now.
The thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se. They want universal, affordable coverage that doesn’t leave them begging on GoFundMe for their kids’ insulin. In that same Kaiser survey, support for "Medicare for All" was highest — 71 percent — when respondents were told it would "guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans."
And purity tests aside, there are many ways to achieve that outcome. Across health policy wonkland, there are vibrant debates over many alternative ideas. These include allowing non-elderly adults to buy into Medicare; allowing employers to purchase Medicare for workers; a Medicaid buy-in program; and enrolling all newborns in a government health plan.
Rather than insisting that "there’s no viable path to the Democratic nomination for someone who does not support single-payer health care," as one progressive writer put it, Democrats should start with principles and objectives, and figure out the most effective and feasible route to them.
This is the richest country on Earth. Truly, we can figure this out. But not if we let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Ignore My Socialism, Please!

Texto completo: Part of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign you surely don't recall is her plan for six different capital-gains tax rates, plus a passel of new regulations, to cure the alleged "short-term focus" of corporate America.
She gave the speech in mid-2015, long before any voters were paying attention, then promptly dropped the subject. The topic doesn't seem to have arisen in her Goldman Sachs speeches, which she tried to keep secret, though she did talk about how politicians need to say one thing in public and another in private.
We're at the same point in the 2020 race, with proposals for wealth taxes, Green New Deals and now a Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders op-ed calling for regulation of corporate share buybacks.
For any sane person's taste, our world is far too indulgent of politicians saying blatantly insincere things, but that's a subject for another day.
In a reliable indication of banality, Messrs. Schumer and Sanders begin their widely noted New York Times op-ed by invoking a lost golden age when corporations "shared a belief that they had a duty not only to their shareholders but to their workers, their communities and the country."
Into this garden came a snake in the form of an excessive preoccupation with the share price. The authors claim, without evidence or logic, that "corporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies."
You might wonder how mistreating workers and undermining a company's "long-term strength" helps the share price. Good question. But the senators hurry on to their chief grievance: "One way in which this pervasive corporate ethos manifests itself is the explosion of stock buybacks."
In fact, there is plenty of evidence for the opposite proposition: Companies that engage in big buybacks are the same companies that shower riches on their employees and invest heavily in their businesses. A hot area of research, led by Stanford's Nicholas Bloom and others, actually sees these companies as key drivers of inequality because their pay and benefits are so superior to what most businesses can afford. Think Apple, Cisco and Google-parent Alphabet.
These companies presumably would get a pass from Schumer-Sanders since their employees already are aristocrats. Other, less-favored companies, if they want to buy back shares, would have to prove they are doing "things like paying all workers at least $15 an hour, providing seven days of paid sick leave, and offering decent pensions and more reliable health benefits."
Take away the blather, and what they are promoting is another unfunded mandate -- the disreputable practice of forcing private parties to pay off some constituency so politicians can take credit without having to vote for it.
Let's correct some misconceptions. In a buyback, a company exchanges one asset (cash) for another at the market price, so it should have no effect on the share price except to the extent that it signals a credible commitment by management not to waste shareholder resources on low-return assets such as needlessly large cash balances or other forms of empire building.
When shareholders sell their shares, they don't burn the money in the backyard. They spend it or invest it, in which case it becomes somebody else's income or somebody else's seed corn for a business.
Because the bill promised by Sens. Sanders and Schumer aims at the wrong target, it would achieve nothing good. A new bureaucracy would be needed to enforce their open-ended insistence that a company "invests in workers and communities" before engaging in buybacks. CEOs would get a new incentive to invest in vanity projects and unproductive cash hoards. More realistically, the bill would encourage companies to quit the public markets altogether to avoid the new regulation. Already the number of publicly listed companies has dropped by half in 20 years. When Sens. Schumer and Sanders are done, the public will have no companies left to invest in.
OK, it would be ridiculous of me to suggest that the two authors care about any of this, or care whether their proposal makes sense or would have good effects.
Equally ridiculous are those academics who, in their desire to be noticed, rush out their own op-eds endorsing the latest business- and wealth-bashing plans of Democrats, even though these proposals are not meant to be enacted but only as silly-season signals to the Democratic base.
Why do we put up with it? The things that politicians say are only episodically related to things they do. Their actions in office are highly constrained by interest-group pressures and election considerations, and usually default to the optimal (if not ideal) outcome of gridlock. The rest of the country, meanwhile, goes about its business the best it can.

The ba­nal­ity of evil, 2019 style

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.


Lewis, perhaps, couldn’t have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York’s passage of the absurdly named “Reproductive Health Act.”


Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims — and the birth of a baby girl.


What a weird, wicked world we live in.


Last Monday in Virginia, Delegate Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors’ approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would’ve required only one’s. This was hardly the stuff of “infanticide,” a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn’t helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns “comfortable” while the family decides whether to resuscitate.


Just maybe we’re not very good at talking about the unspeakable.


Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.


Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby’s viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.


In New York City, where about two in five pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.


Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Clinton’s 1996 call for making abortion “safe, legal and rare,” but had hoped we’d seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They’ve also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.


What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?


My own thinking about abortion was partly formed by having almost witnessed a “back-alley abortion” when a college friend sought an abortion in 1970 in Spain. We walked into a room with a white linoleum table over which, not kidding, a single lightbulb hung. We bolted, called home for money, and put her on a plane to London for a legal abortion.


No one wants women to be subjected to such last resorts. But nor should we be celebrating laws that ignore the humanity of an unborn child. While there are only four doctors in the U.S. that perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, “no one gets an abortion on the delivery table,” as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.


It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators’ new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level “victories” of their pro-life counterparts — even, apparently, if it means putting women’s lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.


But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we’ve come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality — whether the developing human baby is a “clump of cells,” a “fetus,” or, even, a “product of termination” — we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Ignore My Socialism, Please! The Democratic election calendar says it's time to bash business and the rich.

Texto completo: Part of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign you surely don't recall is her plan for six different capital-gains tax rates, plus a passel of new regulations, to cure the alleged "short-term focus" of corporate America.
She gave the speech in mid-2015 long before any voters were paying attention, then promptly dropped the subject. The topic doesn't seem to have arisen in her Goldman Sachs speeches, which she tried to keep secret, though she did talk about how politicians need to say one thing in public and another in private.
We're at the same point in the 2020 race, with proposals for wealth taxes, Green New Deals and now a Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders op-ed calling for regulation of corporate share buybacks.
For any sane person's taste, our world is far too indulgent of politicians saying blatantly insincere things, but that's a subject for another day.
In a reliable indication of banality, Messrs. Schumer and Sanders begin their widely noted New York Times op-ed by invoking a lost golden age when corporations "shared a belief that they had a duty not only to their shareholders but to their workers, their communities and the country."
Into this garden came a snake in the form of an excessive preoccupation with the share price. The authors claim, without evidence or logic, that "corporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies."
You might wonder how mistreating workers and undermining a company's "long-term strength" helps the share price. Good question. But the senators hurry on to their chief grievance: "One way in which this pervasive corporate ethos manifests itself is the explosion of stock buybacks."
In fact, there is plenty of evidence for the opposite proposition: Companies that engage in big buybacks are the same companies that shower riches on their employees and invest heavily in their businesses. A hot area of research, led by Stanford's Nicholas Bloom and others, actually sees these companies as key drivers of inequality because their pay and benefits are so superior to what most businesses can afford. Think Apple, Cisco and Google-parent Alphabet.
These companies presumably would get a pass from Schumer-Sanders since their employees already are aristocrats. Other, less-favored companies, if they want to buy back shares, would have to prove they are doing "things like paying all workers at least $15 an hour, providing seven days of paid sick leave, and offering decent pensions and more reliable health benefits."
Take away the blather, and what they are promoting is another unfunded mandate—the disreputable practice of forcing private parties to pay off some constituency so politicians can take credit without having to vote for it.
Let's correct some misconceptions. In a buyback, a company exchanges one asset (cash) for another at the market price, so it should have no effect on the share price except to the extent that it signals a credible commitment by management not to waste shareholder resources on low-return assets such as needlessly large cash balances or other forms of empire building.
When shareholders sell their shares, they don't burn the money in the backyard. They spend it or invest it, in which case it becomes somebody else's income or somebody else's seed corn for a business.
Because the bill promised by Sens. Sanders and Schumer aims at the wrong target, it would achieve nothing good. A new bureaucracy would be needed to enforce their open-ended insistence that a company "invests in workers and communities" before engaging in buybacks. CEOs would get a new incentive to invest in vanity projects and unproductive cash hoards. More realistically, the bill would encourage companies to quit the public markets altogether to avoid the new regulation. Already the number of publicly listed companies has dropped by half in 20 years. When Sens. Schumer and Sanders are done, the public will have no companies left to invest in.
OK, it would be ridiculous of me to suggest that the two authors care about any of this, or care whether their proposal makes sense or would have good effects.
Equally ridiculous are those academics who, in their desire to be noticed, rush out their own op-eds endorsing the latest business- and wealth-bashing plans of Democrats, even though these proposals are not meant to be enacted but only as silly-season signals to the Democratic base.
Why do we put up with it? The things that politicians say are only episodically related to things they do. Their actions in office are highly constrained by interest-group pressures and election considerations, and usually default to the optimal (if not ideal) outcome of gridlock. The rest of the country, meanwhile, goes about its business the best it can.

World Record Egg: From a challenge to social media to a mental health campaign

Texto completo: The Instagram account @world_record_egg was originally designed as a fun way to challenge and question social media, its creators say. However, the account quickly morphed into an opportunity to focus on mental health positivity and to encourage people to speak up.
Following nearly a month of suspense, the mysterious Instagram account that became famous for a picture of an egg – which came out of left field to break Kylie Jenner's record for likes on a single post – revealed its identity late Sunday night. "Identity" is a loose term, though: The egg serves as part of a mental health awareness campaign.
Egg Gang – a group comprising Chris Godfrey, 29, who works in advertising at The & Partnership in London, and two friends, according to The New York Times – is responsible for the Instagram account. The mysterious original post of a brown egg from Jan. 4 now has over 52 million likes, and the account has 10 million followers. The group "declined to talk about the money it has been offered or the big names it has come into contact with," according to the Times.
Nick Tran, Hulu’s vice president of brand marketing and culture, said that Hulu agreed to partner with Egg Gang because they believed in their mission of spreading mental health awareness and wanted to enable them "to share their message as broadly as possible. ”
"It wasn’t just a stunt – it was really about a vision they had to promote something good in the world,” Tran said.
Tran also said that Hulu did not want this video to be exclusive to Hulu customers, noting that he believed viewers would record the video off their phones and share it with the world.
At the start of the video, the egg – which is slightly cracked, has drawn-on eyes and makes some sounds – introduces itself. Then, it notes, "Recently I've started to crack. The pressure of social media is getting to me. "
The egg then makes a direct plea to viewers, stating, "If you're struggling too, talk to someone. " The final still of the episode directs viewers to mentalhealthamerica. net.
The site belongs to Mental Health America, a nonprofit founded in 1909 that is "dedicated to addressing the needs of those living with mental illness and to promoting the overall mental health of all Americans. " The organization currently has over 200 affiliates in 41 states.
Erin Wallace, chief communications officer at Mental Health America, said that the Egg Gang reached out to them regarding using their website at the end of the video. However, Mental Health America was not part of the production of the video.
The reaction to the video "has been great, and we are thrilled that World Record Egg used its big reveal to shine a light on mental health," Wallace said. "It’s important for people to speak up about their mental health, and to seek help if they need it. "

Texto completo: C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.
Lewis, perhaps, couldn’t have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York’s passage of the absurdly named "Reproductive Health Act."
Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims — and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Del. Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors’ approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would’ve required only one’s.
This was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn’t helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we’re not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby’s viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York City, where about two in five pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Clinton’s 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we’d seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They’ve also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?
While there are only four doctors in the U.S. that perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators’ new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level "victories" of their pro-life counterparts — even, apparently, if it means putting women’s lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we’ve come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality — whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus," or, even, a "product of termination" — we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Texto completo: WEST HARTFORD, Conn. - The afternoon high was 12 degrees here this past Thursday, and as soon as the sun set, the temperatures dropped quickly into single digits. The middle of winter in New England: A perfect time for a 76-year-old man who loves to play golf to be somewhere in the south, enjoying warmth and the fruits of a Hall of a Fame career as a basketball coach.
Instead, Jim Calhoun sat in a tiny locker room inside the O'Connell Center at the University of Saint Joseph, a school of a little more than 1,000 undergraduates that began admitting men in the fall.
"It's all the same," he said, twisting his hands nervously in front of him. "And it's not the same."
"Five minutes, Coach," called Ben Wallek, his team manager.
There would be about 500 people in the building, almost a sellout, for the game between Saint Joseph and Johnson & Wales. This is Calhoun's team now - his life, one he eagerly chose - more than six years after retiring from Connecticut, nearly eight years since coaching it to the national title in front of 75,421 in Houston's Reliant Stadium and almost 14 years after his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
In 26 seasons at UConn., Calhoun built from next to nothing a program that won three national championships and produced NBA players by the bushel. "Nineteen lottery picks," Calhoun likes to point out. Which is why it made sense for him to quietly move full time to his home on Hilton Head after he stepped down in 2012. He'd had a myriad health problems, including three bouts with cancer and two serious bicycle accidents.
"I was beat up when I stopped," he admitted, sitting in the tiny office he occupies in O'Connell Center. "I was hobbling badly because of the bike accident I'd had and I was tired. I was 70. It was the right time."
Calhoun's last couple of years at UConn were the best of times and the worst of times. There was the out-of-nowhere national title in 2011, when Connecticut went into the Big East tournament as the No. 9 seed and then won 11 consecutive postseason games to claim Calhoun's third national championship, leaving him behind only John Wooden, Mike Krzyzewski and Adolph Rupp on the all-time list and tied with Bob Knight. (Roy Williams has since won a third title.)
But there was also an embarrassing NCAA investigation involving a former manager offering illegal inducements to a recruit, and academic issues during Calhoun's final years that landed the school on probation during Kevin Ollie's first season as Calhoun's successor.
Even with his iconic status in Connecticut sealed, Calhoun was restless. He worked about 30 games a year for ESPN, keeping his hand in the game, but it wasn't the same.
"I missed the highs and I missed the lows," he said. "More than anything I missed having something at stake. I never felt any pressure going to do a game on TV. I had an itch that needed scratching."
He flirted with Boston College in 2014, but ultimately decided it was too soon to come back, especially to an ACC program that would need a deep-dive effort to rebuild.
Then came a call from Bill Cardarelli, an old friend, who had been the longtime athletic director at Saint Joseph. The school, founded in 1932, was planning to admit men for the first time beginning in the fall of 2018. Cardarelli want to know if Calhoun would help him put together a men's basketball team.
"I have no idea how many games we'll win or how long I'll stay," he said. "But I feel like I can make a mark here - on the school, on the kids. That means something to me."
It wasn't until September that the school formally announced that Calhoun would coach. By then, he had spent months scouting players and recruiting a team. ESPN had a camera crew begin following him in April. The New York Times did a long story on Calhoun's return. WTIC, the 50,000 watt Hartford radio station, signed on to broadcast home games. Joe D'Ambrosio, the play-by-play man throughout Calhoun's UConn tenure, does the play-by-play.
"If nothing else, Saint Joseph has to be the only D-III team in history with its games on a 50,000-watt radio station," D'Ambrosio said laughing, after taping, by his estimate, his 853rd pregame show with Calhoun.
When word got out that Calhoun would coach the basketball team, applications jumped at Saint Joseph. "They told me it was 115 percent higher," Calhoun said. "They call it the Calhoun Effect."
There was just one roadblock in the way of his return: another bout with cancer. This time it was stomach cancer, unrelated to the previous bouts with prostate cancer and skin cancer.
Calhoun had been undergoing chemotherapy until last fall when his doctors told him surgery was the best option.
And so, on Oct. 8 - a week before the start of practice - Calhoun had about 60 percent of his stomach removed.
Nine days later, he was on the sideline for practice, watching Glenn Miller, the former Brown and Penn head coach and Calhoun's longtime assistant at UConn, run the workouts with a roster of 18 freshmen and one sophomore - a Division I transfer. Since there are no scholarships in Division III, Calhoun could bring in as many players as he wanted.
When the season opened on Nov. 6, Calhoun was 100 percent Calhoun, pushing everyone in his orbit to the limit.
"I always believed in creating a certain amount of chaos when I coached," he said. "Some years, I pushed the chaos too far. But the players have to know that I need them to care as much as I care."
In the season opener, a victory over William Paterson, it took Calhoun less than 16 minutes to draw his first technical foul. Six weeks later, he got tossed out of a loss to LaGrange.
The next night, he calmed down and only drew one technical during a win over Rockford.
Since then, he hasn't been teed up, but that doesn't mean he isn't all over the officials.
On Thursday, during a 98-97 overtime loss to Johnson & Wales, he spent more time on the court than in the coach's box.
At one point, he screamed, "You guys are going to have to throw me out of here if you don't start calling them for fouling my guys on those rebounds!"
Johnson & Wales Coach Jamie Benton, who played for Gary Williams at Boston College when Calhoun was at Northeastern, remembers the two coaches going at it in those days.
"It was intense to say the least," he said, laughing after his team had barely survived on Thursday. "Now, I'm coaching against him and when I shake hands with him before the game I think, 'Wow, there's the legend.' Then the game starts and I see the same young coach I remember at Northeastern."
He shook his head. "He's coaching basically an all-freshman team. You look at them and know they're going to get a lot better with him coaching in a hurry."
The argument can be made that trying to coax wins from a bunch of non-scholarship freshmen can keep a 76-year-old legend young. After the rollercoaster loss on Thursday, Calhoun sat with his four assistant coaches and reviewed the long night.
Finally, looking up from the stat sheet he'd been staring at, he shrugged. "We came, we saw, we lost," he said. "Didn't get the job done. That's about all I've got to say."
Then he went to talk to his players. He had plenty to say to them. "Practice 3:30 tomorrow," he said, finally. "This one's gone. We have to be emotionally read to play again Saturday."
The players nodded. There was only one certainty about Saturday: Their coach would be emotionally ready.

A 'Too Big to Fail' Comedy of Errors; The administration was right to stop defending a decision that would have unfairly burdened MetLife.

Texto completo: The Trump administration has been criticized for dropping the federal government's appeal of a 2016 case MetLife won to shed its designation as a "systemically important financial institution," or SIFI. Former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen told the Brookings Institution she "strongly opposed" the administration's decision, since the court's ruling "set standards that would make future designations all but impossible."
In truth, it was the government's refusal to follow any standards that caused Judge Rosemary Collyer to find the designation of MetLife as a SIFI "arbitrary and capricious."
The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, which can deem a firm systemically important if "material financial distress" would "pose a threat to the financial stability" of the U.S. By law, SIFIs must hold higher levels of capital than their peers for the same levels of risk. That added burden can pressure successful companies to restructure or break up, which can raise prices for customers as efficient firms are driven from the market.
MetLife engaged in a 15-month dialogue with FSOC to avoid a SIFI designation, but the agency's decision was a foregone conclusion.
The Basel, Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board designated MetLife as systemically important more than a year before FSOC did it in 2014. U.S. regulators didn't merely follow that body's lead—they participated in its decision. We believe FSOC officials supported the international board's labeling MetLife systemically important and that the U.S. proceedings were merely a formality to implement the decision made in Basel.
At MetLife's presentation to FSOC deputies, we described research showing that the company's liabilities subject to a "run on the bank" were nowhere near large enough to destabilize the financial system. One regulator found the research intriguing and asked for a copy, but we had provided that to the FSOC five months earlier. Avoiding the SIFI designation was an existential issue for MetLife, but these officials hadn't even bothered to read our briefs.
On other occasions, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said he would rather overregulate than underregulate—excesses could be fixed later. But by then firms designated as SIFIs could be permanently harmed. We sued to avoid that fate and preserve MetLife's ability to compete.
Opinion Live Event
Join us on March 4 as WSJ Opinion's Paul Gigot leads a "State of TV News" panel discussion including Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo, CBS's Christy Tanner and "Network" actor Tony Goldwyn. Included in your admission to the event is a ticket to see "Network" on Broadway at a subsequent date.
As the court recognized, the decision that emerged from FSOC's process was "fatally flawed." The agency is supposed to assess companies' vulnerability to distress. That's because strong and stable firms are less likely to experience severe distress that threatens the financial system. But in MetLife's case, the FSOC ignored its own rules and simply assumed MetLife would enter "material financial distress," with no consideration of the likelihood. This imaginary crisis wouldn't be any old distress—the FSOC hypothesized a crisis without precedent in the history of U.S. insurance. Their modelers further assumed that to meet its liabilities MetLife would sell assets randomly, taking avoidable losses for no reason.
The FSOC didn't stop there. Its projections assumed that state regulators responsible for overseeing MetLife would either stand idle or cause industrywide panic if they did intervene. The agency's independent insurance expert dissented from the agency's decision because it relied on "implausible, contrived scenarios."
MetLife uses collateral-backed derivatives to hedge key risks. But the FSOC essentially gave us no credit for these hedges and ignored our counterparties' collateral. When we objected, the agency pivoted and said the collateral could cause instability. Somehow the FSOC construed a risk mitigant as a new source of risk.
In her recent remarks, Ms. Yellen claimed the court's decision in favor of MetLife compels the FSOC to conduct a "full-blown cost-benefit analysis" for SIFI designations. That's false. What Judge Collyer held, citing Supreme Court precedent, is that " 'no regulation is 'appropriate' if it 'does significantly more harm than good.' " She concluded: "Because FSOC refused to consider cost as part of its calculus, it is impossible to know whether its designation 'does significantly more harm than good.' "
MetLife adhered to the Dodd-Frank Act; its lawsuit did not "attack" the law, as the New York Times then editorialized. Dodd-Frank allows nonbank financial companies to contest SIFI designations. The statute's purpose is to "protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts," and we share that goal. MetLife has always stood on its own feet. It remained profitable throughout the financial crisis and emerged strong enough to buy part of AIG's life-insurance operations for $16.4 billion—money AIG used to repay taxpayers.
Ms. Yellen is right that MetLife's court victory set new standards for SIFI designations. They are standards that undergird all American jurisprudence: due process, evidence-based decision making, and the rule of law.

Texto completo: Perhaps the two least honest paragraphs in American newspapers today arrive courtesy of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). Here's how the two pols begin their op-ed for the New York Times:
From the mid-20th century until the 1970s, American corporations shared a belief that they had a duty not only to their shareholders but to their workers, their communities and the country that created the economic conditions and legal protections for them to thrive. It created an extremely prosperous America for working people and the broad middle of the country.
But over the past several decades, corporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies, helping to create the worst level of income inequality in decades.
In claiming that U.S. corporations have somehow become selfish weapons of mass economic destruction, Messrs. Sanders and Schumer encourage readers to look back to those good old days of the 1960s when American businesses were the engines of broad prosperity. The two men remember those times well, and clearly they were highly impressed. That's why as young men they became stalwart champions of the free enterprise system.
Just kidding. That was the era when Chuck Schumer was becoming active in Harvard's Young Democrats club before volunteering for the left-wing presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy. Later, after graduating from Harvard's law school, he made a name for himself in the New York state assembly by attacking asphalt companies and commercial real estate operators, among others.
Mr. Sanders for his part kept busy attacking not just particular businesses, but business itself. In the early 1960s he joined the Young People's Socialist League and seems never to have lost that old time non-religion. In a 2015 piece for the New Yorker Margaret Talbot describes Mr. Sanders in the 1960s and '70s:
In those days, he occupied himself by writing freelance articles--critiques of the stultifying effects of office work or the social-control mechanism of television--and by making very low-budget educational filmstrips. It's safe to say that had Sanders stuck with that career he would not have given Ken Burns a run for his money. One filmstrip, a portrait of Sanders's hero, the socialist Eugene V. Debs, was rendered with static images that remained on the screen for a good long while. Sanders himself voiced Debs, an Indiana native, making him sound like a guy from Flatbush.
In the years since, Mr. Sanders' consistent hostility toward capitalism contrasts with the relative flexibility of Sen. Schumer, who has occasionally called for deregulation of the Wall Streeters who help fund his campaigns. But suffice it to say one should be highly skeptical when these two report that businesses used to be wonderful but have lately become horrible.
This is particularly true when they suggest that corporate stock buybacks, which enrich investors and allow them to fund new ventures, are actually robbing companies of the funds needed to conduct research and development and create new innovations. The Journal's James Mackintosh noted last year:
R&D spending by S&P 500 companies is at the highest proportion of sales since at least 1990, according to Goldman Sachs. Business R&D is the highest proportion of GDP since the government started tracking it in 1959. If short-termism is a problem, it isn't obviously hurting overall R&D spending.
Sens. Schumer and Sanders also try to tie the recent surge of stock buybacks to "relatively stagnant" wages and claim that the "past two years have been extremely disappointing for millions of workers." Unfortunately it seems that the two career politicians don't understand the prosperity of our current era any better than they grasped the 1960s economy of their youth.
Perhaps before submitting the op-ed the two pols should have consulted the report on January jobs data from the Times' own Ben Casselman, who noted that "hiring in the private sector was strong and broad-based, with manufacturers, retailers and construction companies all adding jobs. Wage growth, which has picked up in recent months after years of sluggish gains, remained solid, and the strong labor market continued to pull in workers from the sidelines." He added:
That combination of strong hiring and modest wage gains has put the economy on a strong, sustainable footing. More jobs means more income for consumers, which leads to more spending, and in turn more hiring.
"The virtuous cycle continues," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays. "What's kept this recovery going, what's kept the U.S. economy so resilient to all the things that have clouded the outlook, is a virtuous cycle of a continuously growing U.S. labor market."
Remember, there's always time for another historical rewrite. Perhaps years from now Messrs. Sanders and Schumer will be writing that the businesses of 2019 helped create "an extremely prosperous America for working people and the broad middle of the country." And they'll be right.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Beyond the president's words, and watching to see what lines do or don't draw standing ovations, the State of the Union guest list is always one of the most watched aspects of the president's annual address.
That has certainly been true since 1982, when President Ronald Reagan started the tradition of acknowledging presidential guests in the gallery by honoring the heroism of Lenny Skutnik, who had pulled a plane crash victim from the icy Potomac River. Since then, presidents have invited "Lenny Skutniks" to underscore parts of the address or highlight the administration's achievements.
Members of Congress also each get to invite one guest (congressional leadership gets more) and they often bestow their tickets to make a political point against or in support of the president.
Here's look at some of lawmakers' invited guests to the 2019 address.
State of the Union: Politically wounded from the shutdown, Trump faces a tough time with his agenda
5 things to watch in the president's SOTU address
More: When, where and how to watch this year
Workers hit by the shutdown
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , has invited Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist who lost her home in a 2017 wildfire and was furloughed during the 35-day government shutdown. Pesiri-Dybvik's husband is an air-traffic controller who had to work without pay through the shutdown.
Other lawmakers also plan to invite people impacted by the shutdown including Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. ; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. ; and, according to the Washington Post, freshman Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va.
Trump has said he is willing to shut down the government down again if lawmakers do not approve the money he has requested for the construction of a wall on the U. S. -Mexico border.
Border Patrol representatives
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has invited Manny Padilla, who runs a Customs and Border Protection task force, The Dallas Morning News reported, and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, will bring Brandon Judd, the head of the Border Patrol union. Judd encouraged Trump to stay firm during the shutdown in his demand for a border wall.
Shooting survivors
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , plans to bring Cameron Kasky, a student activist and survivor of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, that left 17 dead in Parkland, Florida.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. , will bring Andy Pollack, the father of Parkland victim Meadow Pollack.
Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, D-Texas, invited Rhonda Hart, whose daughter was among 10 people killed in a May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas.
Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. , invited Lane Murdock, a high school student who helped organize the National School Walkout after the Parkland shooting.
The woman who cornered Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator
Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , is bringing Ana Maria Archila, the woman who berated then-Sen. Jeff Flake as the Arizona Republican tried to take an elevator to cast a vote as part of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.
"I never thought I’d be excited about being in the same room with Donald Trump," said Archila, who is the co-executive director of the left-leaning Center for Popular Democracy.
A soldier's widow
Jennie Taylor, the widow of a Utah mayor killed while serving in Afghanistan, will attend as the guest of Utah Republican Rep. Bob Bishop.
Undocumented ex-Trump golf club employees
Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif. , announced he will bring Sandra Diaz, a native of Costa Rica who worked at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Diaz is now a legal U. S. resident, but she was undocumented when she worked at the club between 2010 and 2013.
Victorina Morales, a Guatemalan who also worked at Trump’s Bedminster club will join Diaz as a guest of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N. J. Morales said she was hired despite telling a supervisor that she had no legal working documents.
The guests are intended to illustrate a contradiction between the hardline statements on immigration that Trump makes in public and the Trump Organization's business practices. Since the New York Times first reported on undocumented workers at Trump properties, the company has fired many workers for presenting fake information when they applied.

A Shot (or 3,000) at the Super Bowl

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Doug Mills, a New York Times photographer who usually covers politics in Washington, has lost count of exactly how many of the 53 Super Bowls he's photographed. But his best guess: Sunday was his 22nd time on the sidelines of the country's consistently most popular entertainment event on television.
As millions of Americans set down buffalo chicken dips and cold beers in front of the TV and crowded into bars to watch the contest between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII, Mr. Mills packed three cameras, four lenses, two extra batteries and extra Ethernet cables, and headed into Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
The Super Bowl is a special assignment for photographers, up there with the Olympic Games and presidential campaigns -- but packed into just a few hours.
"Just like the athletes, the photographers have to be on their game," Mr. Mills said.
He was one of three photographers shooting the game and surrounding pageantry for The Times's sports desk on Sunday. They were joined by five reporters and two photo assistants, plus another photographer shooting photos for the graphics desk. And they filed to four photo editors, six word editors and two graphics editors.
Those three sports photographers were poised to take a lot of pictures: Records from The Times's photo lab show that three people produced just over 16,000 images at the 2017 game. Mr. Mills estimated he'd take 2,000 to 3,000 this year.
"All you can do is ask for it to happen in front of you -- the big play," Mr. Mills said.
The task for photographers shooting the game is to tell the story of the night, and it promises the chance to capture sports history. Like in 2008 when Mr. Mills photographed David Tyree catching a pass on his helmet during a drive that won the Giants Super Bowl XLII and spoiled the Patriots' perfect season. Or in 2015, when A.J. Mast, who joined Mr. Mills on his fifth time shooting the game for The Times, photographed the Patriots' Malcolm Butler intercepting an ill-advised Seahawks pass in the end zone, securing Super Bowl XLIX for New England ("a game-telling picture," Mr. Mast said).
To capture those moments, they said, they absorb themselves in the game, trying to anticipate significant plays based on how the game unfolds.
"I call it staying in the viewfinder," Mr. Mast said.
And they must be thorough, getting everything that could be significant from a variety of perspectives. There's no telling whether a first-quarter touchdown will turn out to be the only touchdown of the game, or whether a referee will end up making a call that alters the game's course. By the end, they must also have images that reflect how the game was won in between those memorable moments -- the workhorse plays that add up to the title.
"If Los Angeles is dominating and most of your photos are of Tom Brady passing, that doesn't make sense," said Kevin D. Liles, who photographed the game for The Times for the first time.
Mr. Liles shot the game from above in the stands, while Mr. Mills and Mr. Mast were on the field in either end zone. They used Ethernet lines that plugged into their cameras to file photos directly to editors in New York. In previous years, The Times had runners take memory cards from photographers on the field to an editor in a photo workroom at the stadium. But last year, many of the photo editors were at the Olympics in South Korea, so The Times used the Ethernet lines for the first time. Mr. Mast said the new workflow allowed the photo team to get a picture from the field onto the home page in a matter of minutes.
The team of photographers at the game for The Times is also responsible for capturing the pomp and entertainment around the game. At halftime, Mr. Mills and Mr. Mast knew to look for someone seizing the spotlight to make a political statement (or at least start a viral moment).
Bedel Saget, a sports graphics editor for The Times, was also in the stands photographing the game, but with the goal of getting photos fit for an interactive that would break down key plays.
He planned to be essentially "sitting on the shutter button," he said, trying to capture as many frames of the action as possible and filing pictures of those important plays to a Google Drive. "That's when the real magic happens."
In New York, the graphics editors Joe Ward and Anjali Singhvi pulled a photo from one of those key moments from the cloud and transformed it into a 3-D image using third-party software called Mental Canvas. They then created an interactive out of that 3-D image that allowed readers to examine the play from different perspectives, moving back and forth through those perspectives by scrolling. The interactive includes simple annotations with each perspective to guide the reader's eye and explain how the play unfolded.
When they first debuted this interactive during the 2018 World Cup, they pulled photos from the games days after they were over. But working with a live event like the Super Bowl, Mr. Ward and Ms. Singhvi must wait to jump on the right moment as the action unfolds, which presents a challenge.
"We don't know what we're going to get," Ms. Singhvi said.
For all the excitement and potential glory of photographing the Super Bowl, Mr. Mills said there is one way it falls short of being a dream job.
"It's a terrible way to watch the game."

Texto completo: On an otherwise unremarkable summer afternoon sometime during the mid-1980s, I had almost completed a fast walk out of the newsroom after turning in my story assignment for the day, when someone standing in publisher Ned Chilton's office caught my eye.
I was anxious to leave my workplace and join a small group of co-workers gathered across Virginia Street in the smoky hallway of the Center Grill. There, they basked in the low-energy glow of an Eight Ball Deluxe machine and gripped long-necked bottles of Bud beaded with droplets of condensation, as they waited for the afternoon pinball tourney to get underway.
While I didn't want to miss the first round of either Bud or pinball, I also didn't want to miss being able to determine if the middle-aged guy in the well-tailored suit who was laughing and shooting the breeze with Ned could be who I thought it might be.
I slowed my pace and peered into the office, where Chilton was perched on the front edge of his desk, and the familiar-looking stranger was seated in a chair facing him. Just before I could fully avert my eyes and continue my march toward the stairway, Ned spotted me and waved me in.
"Meet Russell Baker, he commanded, in his throaty voice, and I reached over to shake the fabled New York Times columnist's extended hand. I had suspected that it was, indeed, Baker I had spotted in Chilton's office, where, over the years, more than a few nationally known movers and shakers had stopped to check in with the publisher as they passed through Charleston.
Despite the wide political divide that separated them, conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. and Chilton remained close friends over the years after first crossing paths at Yale.
A few years before I shook hands with Baker, Ned introduced me to Sen. Frank Church of Idaho, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and namesake of the Senate's intelligence oversight panel, the Church Committee. Ned asked me to give the senator a ride to the airport, and I used my tiny Datsun to complete that mission. While I apologized for the subcompact's lack of speed going up Greenbrier Hill, Church, a conservationist, complimented me for not choosing to buy a gas-guzzler.
So I wasn't exactly shocked to see the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist spending time with the boss, but I was a bit taken aback by the way Ned introduced me to Baker:
"And I'm sure you're familiar with the work of our own columnist, Rick Steelhammer, Ned continued, waving an arm toward me and winking.
"I don't think our motor routes deliver as far as Manhattan, I interjected, after an uncomfortable pause. "So I doubt that Mr. Baker has been able to immerse himself in my work.
"Regrettably, not yet, Baker responded diplomatically. "But if you've made a good enough impression on Ned for him to give you a column, I'm sure I will be hearing good things about you.
Not wanting to wear out my welcome, I remembered reading something about Baker lamenting yesteryear's "swashbuckling newspaper reporters turning into today's solemn young sobersides, and prepared to make my exit. "Ned, Mr. Baker, it's been a pleasure, but I've got some minor swashbuckling to do across the street.
But first I had to trip over my tongue and utter the unintended exit line, "I'm glad you had the chance to meet me.
Last week, Baker, a soft-spoken gentleman with a wry wit, died at age 91.
I am glad our paths briefly crossed before then.
And gave him the chance to meet me.

Journalism should neither be pro- or anti-Trump

Texto completo: I used to be able to watch "Morning Joe" on MSNBC until a couple years back. The show's anchors and guests had interesting, sometimes unpredictable points of view.
No longer, however. Now it is a one-track, one-note news-and-opinion show — not just anti-Trump all the time but invective at that.
This is just one example of our national media these days.
In the Trump era, American national media (CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, Fox News, The Washington Post, The New York Times) have self-divided into openly pro- or anti-Trump factions.
It isn't covert anymore, and many media outlets wear it as a badge of honor.
But when a media outlet is strongly for or against a leader or party, the first casualties are fairness, honesty and accuracy.
We saw this on vivid display in just two recent instances: the Buzzfeed story and the Covington Catholic kids story. In both stories, many national media outlets had not just egg but omelettes on their faces because of their rush to judgment before all the facts had been assembled and confirmed.
The losers in this, obviously, are the American public, who deserve but don't get a fair, balanced, comprehensive picture of their politics from any media outlet.
To be fair, at least one underlying reason for the pro- or anti-Trump slant is simple: It is good for business.
Giving their respective partisan audiences what they want generates ratings, subscriptions and advertising revenue for media outlets.
But aside from staunch partisans, there are millions of Americans, myself included, who care about this vital pillar of our democracy.
There is a great hunger, I think, for a different model of journalism: one that gives an objective, comprehensive picture of politics; that doesn't chase revenue-enhancing clickbait stories that end up hurting the societal fabric; that doesn't carry water for any party, politician or wealthy donor; that follows the truth wherever it may lead; that doesn't constantly tell us what to think.
The last is especially grating — in our news-and-opinion-blurred-times, one pet peeve many avid media consumers have is that many national media outlets actively try to shape public opinion on issues by constantly telling voters what to think, instead of just reporting the facts.
But I'm dreaming, right? All the above changes aren't happening in our current media climate.
But let me present what Glenn Greenwald, a journalist I admire, stated in 2016 about the role of media in a democracy:
"Adversarial journalism is critical for making democracy healthier and checking people who wield great power in ways that are constructive. In a democracy, people have different roles to play regardless of outcomes.
"If Congress passes a terrible law that hurts a lot of people, but it's not running afoul of any constitutional guarantees, nobody should want the judiciary to come in and invalidate the law on the grounds that it's a bad law. That's a violation of the role the judiciary is supposed to play to have a balanced, healthy society.
"In the short term, the mentality in making that law invalidated might help people or prevent harm. In the long term or even the midterm, it's going to make society much unhealthier, because now you have the judiciary running afoul of democratic principles by overriding laws even though they adhere to the Constitution.
"To me, it's more about the roles of politics. If you play a role in the campaign — you're a Hillary Clinton campaign spokesperson or work for Media Matters — fine, spend all day defending a candidate, because that's your role.
"When I was a lawyer, my job was to advocate for people who did the wrong things or who I didn't think were telling the ultimate truth — because that was the role I was supposed to play.
"But when you're a journalist, I think your role ought to be adversarial to people who wield the greatest power and to say the things you think are true — even if it hurts the candidate you like or helps the one you dislike. Because that's how society stays balanced."
A big Amen to that.

Texto completo: Last weekend, Rep. Steve King came to the area and swooped in and out with talking points [Steve King on charges of racism 'They are denigrating Western civilization'].
I just wish he would respectfully resign. Not exclusively because of his latest remarks with the New York Times, but because of all of his past remarks.
He is a stain on the perception of Iowa and should refrain from further comments. He is now proclaiming he was misquoted and that it wasn't taped. We all know that there have been multiple gaffes and fingernail-on-the-chalkboard moments.
Iowa does not need this type of notoriety. Give it up please, Rep. King, and let Iowa grow. Iowa is so much better than this.
— Mary Ann Meyer, Paullina
Is the independent vote the way to go? Here we go again. I am being told that if I vote for an independent candidate, that they can't win, it will elect the other guy and that I will be throwing my vote away.
We all know the gridlock in Washington is caused by the right- and left-wing fringe of both parties.
Being a lifelong Democrat, I find that I also have conservative views on some subjects. So I ask myself, who should I cast a ballot for in the next election?
Should it be a hair-on-fire progressive candidate that promises pie-in-the-sky proposals we all know we can't afford? How about a man with no moral compass and a self-absorbed ego? Or should it be an independent person who could do some good? The last option would be not to vote at all.
After all, if you want to use the word deplorable, it would really describe the choices we were given in the last presidential election. Ask yourself the same question.
— Norman Schmidt, West Des Moines
Why didn't Ernst step up for Blasey Ford? The revelations that surfaced last week regarding Sen. Joni Ernst's personal life are truly heartbreaking.
However, in light of these disclosures, I find two two things even more perplexing.
First are Ernst's aggressive campaign ads where motorcycles, guns, hog castration and the "make 'em squeal" tagline featured quite prominently (surely the most toxic masculine imagery one could conjure).
Second is Ernst's unflagging support for Brett Kavanaugh. Didn't Ernst hear echoes of her own story in Christine Blasey Ford's testimony?
Simply put, have Iowa's politicians become so blindly beholden to party politics that their own histories don't matter and don't inform their judgment?
— Kentin Waits, Knoxville
2020 brings renewable standard to the table With 2020 presidential candidates already visiting, Iowans can expect to hear quite a bit of discussion regarding the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). This is an issue close to many, mostly due to the fact that the production of biofuels has been lucrative in this state.
On its face, the RFS is a well-meaning and seemingly positive concept. By mandating that a certain amount of fuels produced must be biofuels, our nation hoped to protect the environment while stimulating a fledgling industry. The problem is that the incentives for which the RFS provides worked a bit too well, contributing to the destruction of more and more wild lands to plant corn and soybeans.
This wanton destruction has deprived Iowa's diverse array of wildlife of the habitats it so dearly depends upon while also consuming 40 percent of all corn produced in the United States. Clearly, the RFS has bred unintended consequences far outweighing its potential benefits. It is time for this state to reinvest in its already-successful wind power infrastructure and continue pioneering a cleaner, less harmful environmental future.
— Phoebe Stratton, West Des Moines
Border control requires an up-close look I appreciated recently reading the commentary from Denny and Patty Coon [A view from Iowans helping migrants at a Mexican border].
My husband and I recently returned from volunteering at the border in Nogales, Arizona. We had the opportunity to meet with judges, law enforcement, immigrant and defense lawyers, migrants and asylum seekers. It was an eye-opening and sobering experience.
Border security and immigration policy is complicated. The farther away you live from the border, the easier it is to imagine a wall being a simple and practical solution. The closer you get to the border, learn about the issues and meet the people who live along it, the more simplistic and financially irresponsible a wall seems.
For example, I was stunned to learn that the majority of illegal drugs entering the U.S. comes through legal ports of entry hidden in trucks, trailers and other vehicles, not through the "unwalled" desert.
Border security advocates (people who actually live along the border) wish for more border patrol agents, people who inspect incoming vehicles where the bulk of drugs and human trafficking takes place. For example, only 6 of 14 gates are open in Nogales due to lack of agents, despite the fact millions of dollars were spent remodeling and adding gates.
As we move forward, it is critical that people who live farthest away from the border listen to and understand the real needs and situation of people who live closest to the border.
— Jane Shuttleworth, Okoboji
U.S. health care definitely needs changes I find guest columnist Don Racheter's comments about the US health-care system somewhat lacking in factual information [Medicare overhaul would hurt Iowans, unless Sen. Chuck Grassley stops it].
Without any facts, he states we have the best health-care system in the world. Fact: This is the same system that allows insurance companies to determine when you can or cannot receive care based on their policies, and not on your doctor's advice. This is the same system that created the opioid epidemic. This is the same system that earns us the rank of 14th in the infant mortality rate during childbirth. Not to mention that it's inaccessible for many people on the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder.
He points out that "tycoons, royalty and other wealthy foreigners" seek out our health care rather than "seek(ing) care in their socialist systems." That may be true to an extent, but only because they may have the money to afford our health care. Too bad our general population doesn't have similar financial assets.

Texto completo: Dealing with comedian Jerry Seinfeld was no laughing matter, according to a Manhattan federal court lawsuit filed Friday by a car collector that accuses the comic of selling an inauthentic version of a rare luxury Porsche for $1.54 million.
The collector, Fica Frio Limited, says Seinfeld personally attended the 2016 auction on Amelia Island in Florida where the car - a "1958 Porsche 356 A 1500 GS/GT Carrera Speedster" - was advertised in the catalog as being "From the Jerry Seinfeld Collection."
The auction was covered by The New York Times, the lawsuit said, and Seinfeld, a rare car aficionado and collector himself, told attendees "I wanted to be here with you all, who see these things the way I do and enjoy it the way I do. I want to see your face and feel your enthusiasm."  
Although the auction materials described the car as "a prized fixture" in Seinfeld's collection since 2012 and "among the finest restored examples of a highly sought-after four-cam Porsche," the lawsuit said, the next year an expert refused to certify it because of gaps in the car's historic record and pedigree.
Seinfeld at first agreed to return the money for the car, said the lawsuit, quoting a 2018 voicemail in which the comedian allegedly said he wanted to "offer my apology for this nuisance and assure you that you will be completely indemnified."
The comic also said he would "love to know how your guys figured it out because I find that to be interesting cause that's impressive my guys did not I guess see anything amiss with the car when I bought it," according to the lawsuit.
But Seinfeld eventually backed out of the agreement and refused to refund the money, said the lawsuit, which seeks refund of the money in return for the car, and claims negligent and intentional misrepresentation and breach of an oral agreement.
In a statement, a lawyer for Seinfeld said, "Jerry has been working in good faith to get to the bottom of this matter. He has asked Fica Frio for evidence to substantiate the allegations. Fica Frio ignored Jerry and instead filed this frivolous lawsuit."
The lawyer, Orin Snyder, also said, "Jerry is willing to do what's right and fair, and we are confident the court will support the need for an outside evaluator to examine the provenance of the car."
Lawyers for Fica Frio declined to comment.

GAME DAY EATS: Wing joints prepare for big appetites

Texto completo: Chicken wings are a food of choice any day of the year in Atlanta, as evidenced by the amount of wing bones you can regularly spot on city sidewalks. But when the Super Bowl is in town, everyone's got to get a bite of what has become a perennial game snack and one of Atlanta's signature dishes.
Restaurants in Atlanta would normally be ramping up for the annual rush of Super Bowl watch parties and tailgates. With the big game being played in Atlanta, there's an additional demand to supply parties and events leading up to today's kickoff, said Paul Juliano, president of Atlanta chicken wing restaurant chain JR Crickets.
Americans are expected to consume 1.38 billion wings -- both flats and drums -- over Super Bowl weekend, according to the National Chicken Council, a 2-percent increase from 2018.
Consumer demand for wings peaks in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, with college football bowl games also contributing to higher consumption, said Christopher Olson, a brand manager for chicken producer Tyson's Any'tizers line, sold in grocery stores.
Traditional Buffalo-style and lemon pepper wings are among the most popular orders at Atlanta standbys such as JR Crickets and Taco Mac. Restaurants' specialties, including Taco Mac's roasted wings and JR Crickets' "lemon pepper wet" recipe -- a buffalo sauced
wing with lemon pepper seasoning on top -- are also in high demand. Customers are ordering wings in trays of hundreds, Juliano said. Wednesday before the big game, he said JR Crickets placed the largest hot sauce order he remembers making in the restaurant's 37 years.
JR Crickets, which has 13 franchised locations in metro Atlanta, got a boost from a Jan. 29 New York Times article about the best eats for SuperBowlvisitorstoAtlanta, which mentioned JR Crickets. The North Avenue location alone is expected to go through nearly 94,000 medium-sized chicken wings by the end of Super Bowl week, about 10,000 pounds, Juliano said.
While restaurants like JR Crickets fry their wings to order, Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q in Edgewood has been working 24 hours a day for the past week to prepare enough of their signature smoked wings, co-owner Jonathan Fox said. The restaurant has brought in an extra smoker to produce the high volume of wings, brisket, ribs and other meats needed for Super Bowl weekend. The wings take three hours to smoke, and each smoker can fit between 800 and 1,000 jumbo wings at a time.
Fox Bros. began working with its chicken supplier in September to prepare for the demand, Fox said.
For most of Atlanta-based Taco Mac's 25 restaurants, today isn't expected to be significantly different than any other Super Bowl, CEO Harold Martin said. The busiest locations are expected to be those closest to the stadium--Lindbergh, Buckhead and the original Virginia Highland restaurant. The Super Bowl is the restaurant's busiest day for wings, Martin said.
"The college football national championship and National Wing Day are big days for us, but nothing comes close to the Super Bowl," Martin said.
In addition to supplying their restaurant, take-out orders and catering, Fox Bros. also has to supply its stands inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The NFL's Super Bowl security measures added a significant number of extra steps to get the wings from smoker to concession stand, co-owner Fox said.
All of Fox Bros.'employees transporting and selling food at the stadium had to go through background checks and credentialing processes to be allowed to participate in Super Bowl preparations and sales, a process that started in October, Fox said. The wings are carried from the DeKalb Avenue restaurant to the stadium in a refrigerated trailer, which is inspected with a giant X-ray machine before being allowed inside.
After the fourth quarter ends and fans' bellies are full tonight, restaurant workers will have only a few hours to catch their breath. While the demand for wings will decline from its Super Bowl peak, customers will still be rolling in Monday.

Let Children Get Bored Again

Texto completo: "I'm bored." It's a puny little phrase, yet it has the power to fill parents with a cascade of dread, annoyance and guilt. If someone around here is bored, someone else must have failed to enlighten or enrich or divert. And how can anyone -- child or adult -- claim boredom when there's so much that can and should be done? Immediately.
But boredom is something to experience rather than hastily swipe away. And not as some kind of cruel Victorian conditioning, recommended because it's awful and toughens you up. Despite the lesson most adults learned growing up -- boredom is for boring people -- boredom is useful. It's good for you.
If kids don't figure this out early on, they're in for a nasty surprise. School, let's face it, can be dull, and it isn't actually the teacher's job to entertain as well as educate. Life isn't meant to be an endless parade of amusements. "That's right," a mother says to her daughter in Maria Semple's 2012 novel, "Where'd You Go, Bernadette." "You are bored. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it's boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it's on you to make life interesting, the better off you'll be."
People used to accept that much of life was boring. Memoirs of pre-21st-century life are rife with tedium. When not idling in drawing rooms, members of the leisured class took long walks and stared at trees. They went motoring and stared at more trees. Those who had to work had it a lot harder. Agricultural and industrial jobs were often mind-numbing; few people were looking to be fulfilled by paid labor. Children could expect those kinds of futures and they got used to the idea from an early age, left unattended with nothing but bookshelves and tree branches, and later, bad afternoon television.
Only a few short decades ago, during the lost age of underparenting, grown-ups thought a certain amount of boredom was appropriate. And children came to appreciate their empty agendas. In an interview with GQ magazine, Lin-Manuel Miranda credited his unattended afternoons with fostering inspiration. "Because there is nothing better to spur creativity than a blank page or an empty bedroom," he said.
Nowadays, subjecting a child to such inactivity is viewed as a dereliction of parental duty. In a much-read story in The Times, "The Relentlessness of Modern Parenting," Claire Cain Miller cited a recent study that found that regardless of class, income or race, parents believed that "children who were bored after school should be enrolled in extracurricular activities, and that parents who were busy should stop their task and draw with their children if asked."
Every spare moment is to be optimized, maximized, driven toward a goal.
When not being uberparented, kids today are left to their own devices -- their own digital devices, that is. Parents preparing for a long car ride or airplane trip are like Army officers plotting a complicated land maneuver. Which movies to load onto the iPad? Should we start a new family-friendly podcast? Is this an O.K. time to let the kids play Fortnite until their brains melt into the back seat? What did parents in the '70s do when kids were bored in the way-back? Nothing! They let them breathe in gas fumes. Torture their siblings. And since it wasn't actually for wearing, play with the broken seatbelt.
If you complained about being bored back then, you were really asking for it. "Go outside," you might get, or worse, "Clean your room." Was this fun? No. Was it helpful? Yes.
Because things happen when you're bored. Some of the most boring jobs I've had were also the most creative. Working at an import factory after school, I pasted photos of ugly Peruvian sweaters onto sales sheets. My hands became encrusted with glue as the sweaters blurred into a clumpy sameness. For some reason, everything smelled like molasses. My mind had no choice but to drift into an elaborate fantasy realm. It's when you are bored that stories set in. Checking out groceries at the supermarket, I invented narratives around people's purchases. The man buying eggplant and a six-pack of Bud at 9 p.m.: Which was the must-get item and which the impulse purchase? How did my former fifth-grade teacher feel about my observing her weekly purchase of Nutter Butters?
Once you've truly settled into the anesthetizing effects of boredom, you find yourself en route to discovery. With monotony, small differences begin to emerge, between those trees, those sweaters. This is why so many useful ideas occur in the shower, when you're held captive to a mundane activity. You let your mind wander and follow it where it goes.
Of course, it's not really the boredom itself that's important; it's what we do with it. When you reach your breaking point, boredom teaches you to respond constructively, to make something happen for yourself. But unless we are faced with a steady diet of stultifying boredom, we never learn how.
The idea isn't that you suffer through crushing tedium indefinitely like Neville ("N is for Neville who died of ennui") of "The Gashlycrumb Tinies." It's that you learn how to vanquish it. This may come in several forms: You might turn inward and use the time to think. You might reach for a book. You might imagine your way to a better job. Boredom leads to flights of fancy. But ultimately, to self-discipline. To resourcefulness.
The ability to handle boredom, not surprisingly, is correlated with the ability to focus and to self-regulate. Research has shown that people with attention disorders are particularly prone to boredom. It makes sense that in a hyperstimulating world, what at first seems captivating now feels less so; what was once mildly diverting may now be flat-out dull.
It's especially important that kids get bored -- and be allowed to stay bored -- when they're young. That it not be considered "a problem" to be avoided or eradicated by the higher-ups, but instead something kids grapple with on their own.
We've stopped training children to do this. Rather than teach them to absorb material that is slower, duller and decidedly two-dimensional, like a lot of worthwhile information is, schools cave in to what they say children expect: fun. Teachers spend more time concocting ways to "engage" students through visuals and "interactive learning" (read: screens, games) tailored to their Candy Crushed attention spans. Kids won't listen to long lectures, goes the argument, so it's on us to serve up learning in easier-to-swallow portions.
But surely teaching children to endure boredom rather than ratcheting up the entertainment will prepare them for a more realistic future, one that doesn't raise false expectations of what work or life itself actually entails. One day, even in a job they otherwise love, our kids may have to spend an entire day answering Friday's leftover email. They may have to check spreadsheets. Or assist robots at a vast internet-ready warehouse.
This sounds boring, you might conclude. It sounds like work, and it sounds like life. Perhaps we should get used to it again, and use it to our benefit. Perhaps in an incessant, up-the-ante world, we could do with a little less excitement.

Texto completo: He carefully sealed the drawings in a mailing tube and quietly placed them out of sight from his business partner, then went to a meeting.
But when he returned, Granville T. Woods found that his drawings -- a design for a novel invention that held the potential to revolutionize transportation around the world -- were gone.
Woods had a pretty good idea where they were, and confronted his business partner. They came to blows, and his partner's son joined the fray, leaping on Woods's back and choking him.
That dramatic moment, later outlined in a court case, encapsulated how desperately Woods, the most prolific black inventor of his day, fought for recognition for his projects.
Woods is best known for working with electricity in the late 1800s. He is credited by some as having invented the third rail, or at least making significant improvements to it, allowing subways to operate. He also invented safety and communication mechanisms for rail systems.
It was the dawn of the electrical age, and Woods was elbowing greats like Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and George Westinghouse, garnering headlines in newspapers across the country and even earning the nickname "Black Edison."
Woods spoke eloquently and dressed elegantly, often in all black. He would tell people he was born in Australia, a fact many biographers now believe he fabricated to garner respect and dissociate himself from slavery in the United States.
"People would stand back in awe: 'Who is this guy?"' said David L. Head, a former New York City bus driver who researched Woods's life for years and wrote "Granville T. Woods: African American Communication and Transportation Pioneer" (2013).
"Back then most black people couldn't read or write, let alone explain something as dangerous as electricity," he said.
But the recognition came at a hefty price. Woods spent all of his money on legal battles to gain credit for his inventions and barely had enough to survive. He became temperamental and conniving, and abusive toward his wife. When he died, he was destitute and all but forgotten.
"Woods's life -- at times closer to a nightmare than the American dream -- clearly illustrates the harsh realities of being a black inventor at the end of the 19th century," Rayvon Fouché wrote in "Black Inventors in the Age of Segregation: Granville T. Woods, Lewis H. Latimer and Shelby J. Davidson" (2003).
Woods's big breakthrough, in the 1880s, was a communication system for railway workers that he referred to as the induction telegraph. Conductors had a very poor way of communicating with rail stations, so if two trains were heading to the same place at the same time, a collision was all but certain. Woods's invention suspended a coil beneath the train so that as it moved along the rails, a magnetic field would be created around it, allowing messages to be sent uninterrupted.
But before he could file for a patent, he contracted smallpox and was bedridden for months. In that time, another inventor named Lucius Phelps beat him to the punch. Woods was shocked when he saw an article in Scientific American crediting Phelps for a version of the communications system he had been working on for years. He quickly finished his design and applied for a patent, setting off an investigation to determine who started developing the technology first.
Woods was able to show notes, sketches and a working model of the invention, and he secured the patent in 1887.
Woods became embroiled in patent interference cases for more than a dozen of the 45 patents he obtained in the United States, according to Fouché's book. He would often have to supplement his inventing career with side jobs for which he was usually paid a pittance. At one point he gave his landlady part ownership in his company in exchange for room and board.
"In the most basic sense, Woods's day-to-day activities can best be described as surviving and even hustling," Fouché wrote.
Woods married in 1890, but his wife filed for divorce a year later.
"He didn't have money to provide," said Head, the researcher. "He had a temper and would physically and verbally abuse his wife. She wanted his time, his attention. She wasn't getting that."
His most ardent fight was against James S. Zerbe, his business partner at the American Engineering Company, which the two started in 1891. It was Zerbe whom Woods accused of stealing his plans.
Woods was hoping to improve the way electricity powered trains, and was especially drawn to the idea of the third rail, which powers trains from underneath rather than from wires overhead.
Some version of this had already been in place, but only for light rail above ground, Head said. Before Woods, no one had figured out a way for it to be powerful enough to propel trains underground, he said.
Woods and Zerbe would eventually go to court over ownership of the invention. Though Woods won, Zerbe had already patented the design in Europe. It was valued at $1 million.
Woods continued inventing and found moderate success selling his work to General Electric and Westinghouse. One of his later inventions for Westinghouse was an automatic air brake, an early version of a so-called dead man's switch, which slows or stops a train to prevent impact if a conductor is incapacitated. In 1896 Woods made enough money to buy a farm in Rockland County, N.Y.
In 2004, thanks to Head's promotion of Woods's work, New York City issued four million commemorative MetroCards about Woods and an exhibit about him was put on display at the Brooklyn Public Library.
"His modifications made the subways in New York City possible," Head said.
Records are scant, but researchers believe that Granville Taylor Woods (sometimes spelled Tailer) was born on April 23, 1856, in Ohio. His mother was a washerwoman and his father was a sawyer.
As a boy, he was transfixed by the coal-powered locomotives chugging through the prairie. When he was about 10, he got a job at a railroad shop to help support his family and learned about metal making and mechanical engineering. Later, he worked for a railroad company pitching coal into the furnaces of train engines before he was promoted to engineer.
He died on Jan. 30, 1910, at 53, of a cerebral hemorrhage, a complication of smallpox. His burial at St. Michael's Cemetery in East Elmhurst, N.Y., was unceremonious.
"He was thrown in a coffin with two infants and an adult," a historian was quoted as saying in The New York Times in 1975.
That year, a group of students took a trip to the cemetery, where a 10-year-old girl read a tribute to the inventor while workers hoisted a headstone in place.
"At long last," the article said, "Grave 144, Range 3, Plot 5 had a gravestone."
The name of the school attended by the students, in Brooklyn, is the Granville T. Woods School.

Texto completo: In the early-morning hours of April 27, 1913, a night watchman at a pencil factory in Atlanta was startled when his lantern shone upon the mutilated, lifeless body of a girl who had been in the company's employ. She was 13-year-old Mary Phagan, and her murder became one of the most sensational crimes of the era. It also sparked what has been described as perhaps the most vicious episode of anti-Semitism in U.S. history: the lynching of Leo Frank, the factory's Jewish superintendent.
The historian Leonard Dinnerstein, who has died at 84, distinguished himself as an authority on the event with his doctoral dissertation, first published as "The Leo Frank Case" in 1968. His subsequent volumes, among them "Anti-Semitism in America" (1994), established him more broadly as a scholar of that ancient prejudice - its roots, its flare-ups and the ways in which it has been overcome, or not, in modern-day America.
Dr. Dinnerstein, a professor for more than 30 years at the University of Arizona, where he helped build the Judaic studies program, died Jan. 22 at his home in Tucson. The cause was renal failure, said his daughter, Julie Dinnerstein.
Dr. Dinnerstein, the son and grandson of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, said he grew up "on the cusp" - after the generations of Jews who fled to America from the pogroms and before those for whom such events existed only in the distant past.
"The older the person is, the more likely he or she will believe that the Jew is other, that he is outside the mainstream and that he can't trust gentiles," the Jewish News of Greater Phoenix quoted him as saying at a 1998 symposium. He described Jews as existing "on the edges of Christian society," endeavoring to "do the right things to make them think well of us."
He said he stumbled unwittingly into the Frank case as a doctoral student. He was considering devoting his dissertation to the ongoing civil rights movement but felt his curiosity piqued when an acquaintance remarked to him, "Remember, the Jews were involved in civil rights before it became a Negro issue."
A friend who was writing about the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group founded in 1906, suggested that he pursue the Frank case.
"At the time I thought that I was exposing an injustice that occurred in the United States during the Progressive era," he reflected years later, in a 2008 preface to a revised version of his work. "I simply hoped [it] would be published; I had no way of knowing the impact that it would have on scores of students and general readers as well as the contribution it would provide to the development of a more professional analysis of the American, and especially the Southern, Jewish past."
Phagan's murder, Dr. Dinnerstein wrote, fanned the embers of Southern resentment at the increasingly industrialized economy, the exploitation of workers and the Northerners whom they perceived as responsible for it. Despite meager evidence brought against him at his trial - where crowds gathered outside shouting "Kill the Jew" - Frank was sentenced to death.
In 1915, after the governor commuted his sentence to life imprisonment, a mob proclaiming itself the Knights of Mary Phagan abducted Frank from prison and hanged him from a tree. Half of Georgia's 3,000 Jews fled the state, the New York Times reported years later.
In 1982, a witness came forward to accuse another factory employee as Phagan's killer. Four years later, while not asserting Mr. Frank's innocence, Georgia pardoned Frank because the state had been unable to ensure his safety and had failed to prosecute his killers.
Dr. Dinnerstein conducted a broader historical study in "Anti-Semitism in America," a volume that the journalist and writer George Packer described as an account of "one of the country's dirty secrets."
In the volume, Packer wrote in a Chicago Tribune review, Dr. Dinnerstein "cataloged three centuries of American anti-Semitism of every kind, from social slights in elite clubs to dubious racial theorizing by respectable scholars, from beatings by Irish cops in 1902 to fraternity pranks in 1978, from Father Coughlin to Minister Farrakhan."
Anti-Semitism reached its apex in the United States in the early 1940s, Dr. Dinnerstein wrote, as Americans emerged from the Depression and feared new rounds of immigration amid World War II. He described one alarmist speaker stoking fears about "200,000 Communist Jews at the Mexican border waiting to get into this country," ready to "rape every woman and child that is left unprotected."
In his view, anti-Semitism was too deeply embedded in Christian culture to ever completely fade from American life. But through efforts such as the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, which rejected anti-Semitism and age-old depictions of Jews as the killers of Christ, he found room for hope, citing his own experience as evidence.
"When I do something people respond to me as an individual," he said at the 1998 event, "not as a member of a group."
Leonard Dinnerstein was born in the Bronx on May 5, 1934. His mother, the daughter of immigrants from Austria and Romania, was a homemaker. His father, who was born in modern-day Belarus, was a postal employee before working for his wife's family's grocery during the Depression.
Dr. Dinnerstein received a bachelor's degree in history from the City College of New York in 1955 before studying American history at Columbia University, where he received a master's degree in 1960 and a PhD in 1966. He joined the University of Arizona in 1970 and retired in 2004.
Survivors include his wife of 57 years, the former Myra Rosenberg of Tucson; two children, Julie Dinnerstein of Manhattan and Andrew Dinnerstein of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a sister; and a granddaughter.
Dr. Dinnerstein's books included "Ethnic Americans" (1975), co-authored with David M. Reimers; "Natives and Strangers" (1979), co-authored with Reimers and Roger L. Nichols; and "America and the Survivors of the Holocaust" (1982). "Anti-Semitism in America" received a National Jewish Book Award.
As for Leo Frank, "the story," Dr. Dinnerstein wrote in 2008, was "not a pretty one. As we continue to learn more about the murder of Mary Phagan, there are still people who sincerely believe that Frank was guilty of the crime for which he was convicted. Some are still in doubt. I have no doubts: Frank was innocent."

Texto completo: A year after launching an investigation into a shadowy social-media company based in West Palm Beach, Florida’s attorney general’s office said it has permanently barred the company from dubious practices.
Attorney General Ashley Moody said she imposed a lifetime ban on Devumi, a company that hawked phony Twitter followers to celebrities, professional athletes, comedians, television actors and others trying to pad their social media profiles. Devumi sold hundreds of millions of fake followers, known as bots, to some 200,000 customers nationwide, Moody said.
The Florida Attorney General’s Office secured an agreement with Devumi Inc, Devumi, LLC and owner German Calas Jr., to stop the company’s deceptive social media practices. Devumi deployed armies of bots designed to give the appearance that real people were expressing opinions, sharing information or otherwise engaging in social media activity, Moody said.As part of the deal, Devumi Inc, Devumi LLC and Calas Jr. are prohibited from:
• Buying, guiding, controlling or managing any social media accounts.
• Using any “natural person’s personal information without that natural person’s express, written consent to generate products or services.”
• Scraping personal information without express, written consent, regardless of whether that information
is available to the public. Advertising, selling or offering to sell products or services from bots.
• Making any misrepresentation regarding or fraudulently endorsing any individual, product or service.
• Providing paid endorsements without clearly disclosing that the recipient compensated Devumi or Calas.
“Social media fraud is serious deception and can give users unwarranted influence,” Moody said in a statement. “Through the use of bots, consumers may be tricked into believing a product, person or message is much more popular than it actually is.”
Calas couldn’t be reached for comment. Moody said the agreement required him to pay $50,000 in investigation costs.
Moody’s predecessor, Pam Bondi, last year began investigating allegations of identity theft by Devumi. Her announcement followed a report in the New York Times that Devumi and its parent company, Bytion, also of West Palm Beach, created phony accounts on Twitter and sold them to celebrities and companies looking to build their social media followings. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also opened an investigation.
In some cases, The Times reported, Devumi created phony accounts based on the photos and names of real people. In other instances, Devumi simply created phony Twitter accounts attached to no identifiable person, the paper said.
Devumi and Bytion were operated by Calas, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
“We strongly believe that individuals and small businesses shouldn’t struggle with social media,” Calas said in a 2012 news release. “We started our company to fill this gap by offering an affordable and quality service that makes sense. So for as low as $17, anyone can make a huge impact on their social media campaign with more Twitter followers, Facebook likes and YouTube views.”
In 2015, Devumi issued another news release saying it charged $19 to $499 a month for its Twitter services.
Apparently, business was good. In late 2013, soon after he turned 23, Calas bought a $355,000 condo at CityPlace South Tower. In 2016, he bought another unit at CityPlace South Tower, paying $803,000 and taking a mortgage for $417,000.

Texto completo: BELGRADE, Serbia -- The last thing Borko Stefanovic remembered was three men standing in the shadows.
"They stepped out and knocked me in the head with knuckle dusters," said Mr. Stefanovic, a Serbian opposition politician. His head was split open, drenching his shirt in blood. He lost consciousness.
In Serbia, a country with a long history of political violence, Mr. Stefanovic immediately suspected that the beating in late November was intended to send a message: Stop talking about the nexus between criminal networks and political leaders.
If so, it didn't work.
Protesters seized on the attack, and they have taken to the streets every week since the beginning of December in ever-growing numbers -- now by the tens of thousands -- to challenge President Aleksandar Vucic and his Serbian Progressive Party.
"No more bloody shirts," is their rallying cry.
The widening protests, which have now spread to cities beyond Belgrade, the capital, are shaping up to be a pivotal moment for the Vucic government, as Serbia is being tugged between its traditional allegiance to Russia and its desire to join the European Union.
The demonstrations have cast a harsh light on Mr. Vucic, and on whether he is prepared to embrace Western democratic principles that are already being tested by the younger members of the European Union, like Hungary and Poland. His opponents say he is following the model of light authoritarianism dressed up with the trapping of democracy that has become common in Turkey and Russia, among other countries.
Mr. Vucic started his career as an ultranationalist during the bloody wars that convulsed the Balkans in the 1990s. He served as information minister under President Slobodan Milosevic until the leader was ousted in 2000.
In the years since the fighting ended, Mr. Vucic has sought to remake his image, helping form a moderate party in 2008. He won a commanding victory in the 2017 presidential election, and has built up his support largely on the promise of overhauling the state-driven economy and putting Serbia on a path to joining the European Union.
Today, the Serbian Progressive Party controls all but three municipalities in the country. Mr. Vucic has used that dominance, his critics say, to take over the levers of the state -- the news media, law enforcement and the courts -- and to turn them against his opponents.
Among those raising concerns is Nebojsa Zelenovic, the mayor of Sabac, one of the three places not controlled by the governing party. In November, he went to Strasbourg, France, to testify before the Council of Europe about what he called a raft of abuses.
"Police investigators, tax officers, pro-government tabloids are prosecuting only the ones considered not to be loyal to the central government, irrespective of the law and the will of the citizens who voted for us locally," he charged.
After giving that speech, Mr. Zelenovic said, he was accused of stealing millions of dollars in public money. He was acquitted, but the judge who handled the case then found herself under attack.
"Beneath that European surface, Vucic is a dictator," Mr. Zelenovic said in an interview.
Mr. Vucic sat down for an interview with The New York Times at the presidential palace the night after hosting a lavish state reception for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, with 100,000 people bused into Belgrade to welcome him.
He brushed off the criticisms directed at him. "I think that we belong to a very democratic society," he said with his characteristic calm.
He and his supporters say the first demonstrations had been hijacked by political rivals and outside forces who do not want Serbia to move closer to the West.
But the recent protests appear to have started organically and have only grown. They are now animated by a wide range of complaints, particularly among young people demanding less government control over the media, more safeguards to ensure elections are free from intimidation, greater economic opportunity and less corruption.
Jelena Anasonovic, 24, is too young to remember the war. She is not a politician and doesn't have a plan for dealing with Kosovo, which broke away from Serbia in the 1990s. All she knows is that she is fed up.
"Our parents and grandparents tell us, 'Do not get involved,' " she said. "My mom said they will destroy your life and your future," she added, referring to the governing party.
But after Mr. Stefanovic was attacked, she joined a group of students and, in early December, helped organize the first weekly march. She thought 7,000 people would turn out; twice as many as that did.
Mr. Vucic, speaking to supporters after the first protest, was dismissive. "Even if there were five million people in the street," he said, he would not bow to their demands.
His comment was widely shared on social media, and protesters began wearing buttons and carrying signs reading "One in five million." By January, tens of thousands were taking part in demonstrations.
Mr. Vucic told The Times that he did not regret the comment, but said it had been taken out of context. "I was saying that I would always listen to the people, but I would never listen to those politicians who ruined the country," he said.
But the opposition is not alone in raising concerns about the country.
In an assessment of the April 2017 presidential election, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that "biased media coverage, an undue advantage of incumbency and a blurred distinction between campaign and official activities undermined the level playing field for contestants."
And a 2017 report by Transparency Serbia and the Center for Investigative Journalism, Serbia, outlined ways political control is exerted over security forces and the rule of law is undermined.
"For example, police have exerted pressure on leaders of independent bodies, the opposition and people who have criticized the authorities," the 91-page report said.
Mr. Stefanovic says he was most likely attacked because he had spoken publicly about possible connections between party bosses and criminal networks, and what he sees as the corrupt use of state money and the awarding of state contracts.
Mr. Vucic said he could rebut each criticism and pointed to his government's handling of Mr. Stefanovic's beating. "We immediately arrested all three guys who attacked him," he said. "I condemned, in a most serious and most responsible way, those guys."
The president blames Kosovo, and his bold -- some say dangerous -- plan for a land swap to resolve the dispute with the mostly Muslim and ethnic Albanian region, for the growing street protests.
He noted that he had been accused of betraying the homeland, of "ruining our territorial integrity."
Still, Mr. Vucic has vowed to press ahead with negotiations on Kosovo. "Serbs will say they are fed up with humiliation," he said. "If we are going to reach a compromising solution, it will mean both Albanians and Serbs will need to be equally dissatisfied."
But for young protesters like Ms. Anasonovic, the sense of humiliation comes not from Kosovo, but from daily life.
"We are confronted on a daily basis with so many lies and threats," she said. For speaking out, she said, she has been branded a traitor. "In the 21st century, we cannot stand one more day living like this."

Will Trump's Taliban deal boost ISIS in Afghanistan?

Texto completo: Republican lawmakers are worried President Trump's tentative deal with the Taliban to end the Afghanistan War is ignoring the new danger posed by an Islamic State offshoot group that's on the rise.

“Everybody's talking about the wrong thing,” a Republican congressman who recently traveled to Afghanistan told the Washington Examiner . "They're talking about the Taliban. They need to be talking about ISIS."

The new group, known as ISIS-Khorasan Province, wants to emulate the self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria can be inferred from their name. “Khorasan” refers to a region of an ancient Persian empire that stretched across parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Iran, and other Central Asian countries.

The terror cell in northern Afghanistan has developed into one of the most troublesome destinations for terrorists. Another Republican lawmaker said a U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be a gift to the group that aspires to overthrow the central government in Kabul.

The emerging U.S. deal with the Taliban is based on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen stressed the need for “withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan” in a message to the Associated Press on Wednesday about a prospective deal with the United States.

“We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,” Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, the diplomat leading the U.S. side in the talks, told the New York Times. “The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.”

That’s easier said than done, especially if the U.S. leaves, and particularly in the case of ISIS-Khorasan, which grows in part by paying the Taliban fighters to abandon their leaders and join the upstart group.

“ISIS pays exponentially more to their soldiers,” the Republican congressman said. “So you have Taliban terrorists, whatever you want to call them, defecting to ISIS because they can bank two to three times [what they’re paid by the Taliban]. All the while we're pulling out and creating the dynamic for ISIS to just mow through.”

The lawmaker added that a total withdrawal would “inevitably” result in “Afghanistan caving into turmoil with ISIS taking over to a large degree there.”

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, acknowledged ISIS has been weakened, but said threats still remain in Afghanistan, the country where the U.S. has waged its longest war.

He also said the Taliban’s hostility to ISIS-Khorasan shouldn’t be perceived as a basis for cooperation, and said he issued similar warnings under President Barack Obama.

“My most significant disagreement with the Obama administration and how they dealt with Syria and with ISIS is they believed we could make common cause with what they believed to be less-bad terrorists,” the Texas senator told the Washington Examiner . “There is no common ground with jihadists.”

The Trump administration itself noted last year that ISIS is gaining strength in Afghanistan, a warning that Republicans are still heeding even as the U.S. considers a withdrawal.

"ISIS has grown stronger over the last couple of years, despite a really withering military campaign, principally from U.S. forces, but with strong support as well from Afghan forces,” a State Department official told the Washington Examiner in June.

Texto completo: Rejected by 35 publishers, “Home Land," Sam Lipsyte's second novel, revealed the writer as the reigning king of riff. Told in a series of chipper and increasingly demented missives to an alumni newsletter from a ne'er-do-well known as Teabag, the 2004 novel stands as a poisonously uproarious monument to the disappointments and soul-chafing alienation of early adulthood. It presented a tauter, deadlier distillation of the jagged and oftentimes brilliant voice Lipsyte had introduced in his earlier novel and stories, one now being compared, favorably, to that of Phillip Roth.
Five years later, Lipsyte came out with “The Ask," an even tighter, more commercially successful novel about yet another failure, this one a nonprofit administrator forced to bow before an immeasurably wealthy tech bro. In its wake, The New York Times hailed Lipsyte as a generational avatar whose book had “announced the onset of the Generation X midlife crisis." Somewhere along the way, he became chairman of the writing department at Columbia University and a regular in the fiction pages of The New Yorker. Our foremost chronicler of failures had achieved every marker of worldly success.
Enter his latest novel, the long-awaited “Hark." It takes on what seems like a can't-miss target: the moneyed mindfulness movement nudged along by the emergent spirituality of the tech sphere's professional-managerial class — think TED Talks and Burning Man and Soul Cycle. This subject has proven irresistible for Gen-X avatars across all media; witness the 2015 reprise of David Cross and Bob Odenkirk's classic '90s sketch comedy program “Mr. Show with Bob and David," which featured a feeble bit about a guru quite obviously modeled on a real-life guru named David “Shingy" Shing, a denim-clad Aussie with receding Sonic the Hedgehog hair and clear glasses who holds the unfathomable job title of “digital prophet" at Verizon Media Group.
Lipsyte's guru is the titular Hark Morner, a failed comic who has written a wildly popular book on Mental Archery, a method of focus he is invited to present in boardrooms and at corporate retreats. It blends mindfulness and visualizations around archery.
Mental Archery, although it affects people deeply, has no deeper meaning, something its principal practitioner frequently reminds his ever-larger audiences. “I don't have a message," Hark says. “There is no core philosophy, no Vedic truth, no Confucian wisdom, no grand Western synthesis, no radical breakthrough in the grand human endeavor."
This lack of focus (pun intended) proves troubling to the reader — how can she engage with a text whose central figure has such little substance? The lack of message also proves troubling to Hark's acolytes, from whose points of view we get the narrative. More or less.
Frank “Fraz" Penzig, our requisite Gen-X failure, mithering through late middle age, gets the most column inches. His marriage is failing; his teaching career is in the toilet; and he doesn't feel at home in a newly sincere world. “Irony is bad," a student of Fraz's explains in an early scene one wishes were funnier.
Rounding out Hark's crew are a pair of attractive, sophisticated, two-dimensional women in their early 30s named Kate and Teal. Teal has been to prison for embezzlement, and super-rich Kate bankrolls Hark. Meanwhile, as America engages in a land war with Europe — the conclusion of a series of unfortunate events kicked off by a terrible president — the trio will find themselves caught up in a farce of global proportions.
Ultimately, this is a book about the dangerous rise of sincerity. Or of earnestness. Or the limitations of Gen-X cynicism. Or the merits of Gen-X cynicism. Or the futility of man's search for meaning. Or something.
The biggest problem with “Hark" is not that it lacks the antic energy of Lipsyte's past efforts, but that Lipsyte, in broadening his scope to include matters both societal and domestic, often loses the thread. Even his riffs are rambling. Where is the reader left in all this? Exactly.
HARK

Trump's '16 campaign false advertising

Texto completo: The news that Donald Trump's approval rating is near historical lows brings some relief that the laws of political gravity still apply. When the president is doing a spectacularly bad job, a majority of our fellow citizens - or at least a clear majority of people contacted for the Washington Post-ABC News poll - think Trump is doing badly.
Compared with polling from when Trump took office, perceptions of the president's performance have plummeted on the federal budget deficit, on improving the health care system and on the economy.
Perhaps the greatest danger to Trump's political future is the cost of these negative perceptions to his brand. The president was elected, in part, by giving his supporters an impression of business acumen. This was, in fact, the image carefully cultivated by book publishers and TV producers. And by Trump himself as a presidential candidate, who claimed to be a peerless negotiator, an unrivaled businessman and an excellent manager.
These claims can now only be believed by the ideologically addled.
The problem for Trump is not only that he lost the most visible and important confrontation of his presidency - in negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the government shutdown. It is that his methods are so blunt and transparent. His typical tactic is to raise the stakes of a negotiation impossibly high - a government shutdown or nuclear war - then to make a maximal demand and trust in the triumph of his stronger will. It is a form of negotiation ended by someone saying "uncle." That Trump ended up in abject humiliation was perhaps fated by biology: You can only angrily hold your breath for so long.
If, in the next stage, the loser acts unilaterally under the pretense of a border security crisis, it will merely prove that Trump is a dangerously sore loser. For the MBAs taking notes, this complex negotiating strategy is known as: Throwing the game off the table if you can't win.
Meanwhile, in a variety of global negotiations, American opponents need only master one method: flattery. In Trump's words, "I know people, because deals are people.  If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin respects me, and if Putin wants to call me brilliant, and other things that he said which were, frankly, very nice, I'll accept that." Taken at face value, Trump is arguing: Deals are people. People who praise me have good judgment. Thus, people who praise me make good deals. Hearing these sentiments from an American president is enough to gag a historian. It is pathetic gullibility elevated into the realm of theory. It should concern us that the American president is a source of global derision and national shame.
The other branding claims made by Trump have become equally incredible. His reputation as a self-made billionaire lies in ruins. An extensive New York Times story on Trump's wealth found a bassinet millionaire, consistently bailed out of bad bets, who dodged gift taxes, milked his empire for cash and cultivated a deceptive image of business brilliance. And special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may reveal serious corruption and perjury in cataloging Trump's 30-year panting desire to sell his brand in Russia.
And who can take Trump seriously as a manager? He has a talent for weeding out the talented and responsible. He is a world-class nepotist. He is incapable of delegation or of taking conflicting advice. He is unreliable in dealing with his allies. He is capable of taking several conflicting policy views on the same topic - be it health care, or the Dreamers, or gun control - in a matter of days or hours. He often has no clear goals. He has no attention span and is consistently ignorant of details. He is prone to vicious and public abuse of rivals and of employees. Try to put that profile up on LinkedIn.
Those 37 percent who approve of Trump's performance may point to the state of the economy or the composition of the Supreme Court. They may be impressed by his destruction of norms or enthused by his promotion of exclusion. They may want a president who speaks his mind, even when it is hateful gibberish. They may want a president who is an institutional arsonist, even if the result is mere destruction.
But no one can reasonably claim to believe in Trump's brand as it was sold in 2016. We have plumbed the shallows of his boasts. They are refuted lies. And whatever else the president may be, he is a fraud.

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd proved a Q&A doesn't have to be more than a series of questions and answers when you're on stage with Tom Hanks.
The two friends launched the 6th Annual Rancho Mirage Writers Festival Tuesday with a Q&A that never quite turned into a conversation. Hanks looked at the capacity crowd in the newly refurbished Helene Galen Auditorium at the Annenberg Center at Eisenhower Medical Center, and joked, "We gotta put on a good show, Cher. I'll be Sonny and you be Cher," sparking a light exchange portending to an evening of quick, snappy repartee.
Hanks noticed the Olivier Award-winning British actor and director Derek Jacobi in the front row and credited him for being a reason he became an actor. He observed cable news contributors Douglas Brinkley, Jon Meacham, Karl Rove and Bret Stephens sitting down house left, a veritable Mt. Rushmore of expert commentators, and inspired a sense that the audience was in for a night of serious dialogue, too.
Then Dowd began reciting a series of preconceived questions unrelated to Hanks' Oscar or Emmy Award-winning career or his new reputation as the author of a collection of uncommonly good short stories, titled "Uncommon Type: Some Stories," which had been distributed to donors for free on this "Angel Night 2019."
Hanks began in top form, answering Dowd's question about the first thing he'd do if elected president by quipping, "I would order the change of the name Fred Waring Drive to Tom Hanks Drive." Then he seriously said he'd rebuild America's infrastructure.
Soon, however, he was slipping into smart-aleck defense mode, retorting that a question was "above my pay grade" when in fact he was impressing the crowd with his intellect. When the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist apologized for asking long questions, Hanks responded, "I'm not sure they're questions, Maureen."
Aware of the cable news and Shakespeare royalty in the front row, he begged the news channels to quit bringing Watergate into every conversation about White House politics, and he imagined President Trump substituting a line from "Richard III" with a golf phrase: "A course, a course, my kingdom for a course!"
When Dowd complemented Hanks on his book and said she wanted to talk to him about it, Hanks joked, "I'm glad because we have 90 seconds." Then he compared his process as an actor to the work he put into his short stories.
"The work that I do, I do it and I love it because it demands a kind of introspection and a journey that sometimes I'm attracted to," he said, "and other times I'm dragged kicking and screaming into the reality of the emotion that you have to do.
"The stories in the book I would say — outside of Nazi soldiers in one of the stories — there's no bad guys in it because life is just goofy this way. The best people in the world can let you down."
The theme of this writers festival, continuing through Friday at the Rancho Mirage Public Library, is a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings in World War II. Besides talks on the subject by presidential historians Brinkley and Meacham, the festival features discourses on the war by fellow historians Rick Atkinson, Sir Antony Beevor and H.W. Brands. Dwight D. Eisenhower's granddaughter, Susan Eisenhower, will interview author Anne Sebba about Parisian women in World War II on Thursday afternoon and Emily Yellin will discuss her book, "Our Mothers' War: American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II" on Friday morning.
Festival founder Jamie Kabler asked Dowd to query Hanks if the lessons of World War II could be forgotten, and the star of "Saving Private Ryan" and the producer of "Band of Brothers" and "The Pacific" responded thoughtfully that history is constantly forgotten.
"No one is good at remembering those lessons," he said. "In the history, there's always been some knothead who said, 'I know what's best for my people,' and he goes out and conquers the entire world, his world, and brings what's best for his people. Then, as soon as he dies, it all just falls apart.
"It's going to happen again. It's happening in some version of what we're looking at now. There's a bunch of knotheads everywhere that can put together just enough members of a Parliament or a government to hold sway for a while, but it doesn't last. It can't last because cracked vessels don't hold water.
"There's an election coming up around the corner. It's in two years and it's not just about who's going to be president of the United States. It's going to be about who's taking Sonny Bono's place, who's going to be the water commissioner, who's going to run the library, who's going to be the congressman and who's going to be the senator? That is going to be the wheel of change that is not going to solve every problem, but it will get us along to whatever the next step is, and that's why the greatest concept that has ever been put down on paper is one that we have become bored with and take for granted."
Hanks then recited the preamble to the Constitution to great applause. Emmy Award-winning producer and author Geoffrey Cowan, moderating the next conversation with those Mt. Rushmore figures from cable news, asked, "How many people think Tom Hanks should run for president?"
Cowan stimulated an interesting conversation with Brinkley, Meacham, Rove and Stephens. One revelation was Meacham's acknowledgement that he read the eulogy he delivered last month at George H.W. Bush's funeral to the 41st president in July.
All the panelists agreed that the spate of books about Trump in his first two years in office is surprising, but not terribly meaningful to history. Brinkley noted that the rule of thumb is it takes 25 years to have a clear perspective on the historical performance of a president. He said books on Presidents Eisenhower and Harry Truman prompted public re-evaluations of their performances and they're now considered among the 10 best American presidents in history.
Stephens called the Rancho Mirage Writers Festival "nationally important" and Kabler called this year's lineup of authors its "strongest ever."
The festival is sold out through the final talk by Sally Field on Friday afternoon, but videos of every presentation will be available at dates to be announced on RMTV, Channel 17, the festival's website at rmwritersfest.org/videos and its YouTube channel at youtube.com/c/ranchomiragewritersfestival.

Texto completo: Since Iowa City is a UNESCO City of Literature, there are book readings nearly every day at area book stores, the public library and other venues.
Since Iowa caucus season has officially launched, a political wrinkle to the literary tradition is becoming the norm: 2020 presidential candidates coming to town for book readings.
Noted author and activist Marianne Williamson will read from her book "Healing the Soul of America: Reclaiming Our Voices as Spiritual Citizens" at 3 p.m. Saturday at Prairie Lights. Williamson officially announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president Tuesday.
In March at the Iowa City Public Library, South Bend, Indiana mayor and War in Afghanistan veteran Pete Buttigieg will read from his book "Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future." He announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination Jan. 23.
Buttigieg's event is a part of a new series of events hosted by the Iowa City Book Festival, Iowa City UNESCO City of Literature's marquee annual event. The exact time of the event has yet to be determined.
The two readings will combine with the already announced Prairie Lights reading for Democratic presidential nominee Andrew Yang at 5 p.m. March 13 at the bookstore. Yang was slated to read at Prairie Lights Wednesday but the event was postponed due to the historic and dangerous cold temperatures in Iowa City and the rest of the Midwest.
John Kenyon, executive director of Iowa City UNESCO City of Literature, said that these type of presidential events with candidates reading from their books have been becoming more and more common.
"With each passing election cycle, the idea that a serious candidate needs to launch a campaign with a book is more and more cemented," Kenyon said. "With so many Democrats running this year, we'll see many more in our area as they seek to differentiate themselves and separate themselves from the pack."
He added that candidate memoirs and policy books "remain the best way in our soundbite-driven world for a candidate to lay out their ideas and discuss at length why their vision is the one we should follow."
Williamson is best known in Iowa City and throughout the country as the author of numerous New York Times best-selling non-fiction books, including "A Return to Love," that focus on spirituality and other fields. "A Return to Love," published in 1992, spent 39 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.
"My campaign for the presidency is dedicated to this search for higher wisdom," Williamson said in a news release about her candidacy. "Its purpose is to create a new political possibility in America — where citizens awaken, our hearts and minds are uplifted, and our democracy once more becomes a thing about which we can all feel proud."
Besides her political activism and writing, Williamson is known as the founder of Project Angel food, a nonprofit organization that delivers food to people who are suffering from AIDS and other diseases who cannot leave their homes.
Kathleen Johnson, Prairie Lights event coordinator, said earlier this month that Williamson has spoken at Prairie Lights multiple times in the past.
Buttigieg is new to many in the national political arena. The 37-year-old Democratic mayor is a graduate of Harvard University and was a Rhodes Scholar. In 2009, he became a intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013.
He is also an openly gay married man, which would make him the first openly gay nominee for president for either party and first openly gay president if his campaign reaches those heights.
"The show in Washington right now is exhausting: the corruption, the fighting, the lying, the crisis," Buttigieg said in a video that announced he had launched a presidential exploratory committee last week. "We can't look for greatness in the past. Right now, our country needs a fresh start."
Kenyon said the series of readings centered around authors with political and social engagement books came out of organizing the annual Iowa City Book Festival, which brings dozens of nationally and internationally renowned authors to Iowa City every year.
"We had such success with politics, (and the) social engagement track at the Book Festival that we wanted to explore opportunities to offer similar programming throughout the year," Kenyon said. While talking to publishers about this new idea, Buttigieg's event was the first to be organized as part of the series.
Kenyon said he'd like to see this series become a regular happening in Iowa City, but that is dependent on the schedule of writers and of the City of Literature.
"Iowa City is not lacking for readings, so we're looking to augment with unique opportunities, not compete with what is out there," Kenyon said.
Previous political book readings organized by the City of Literature include Robert Reich, the former U.S. Secretary of Labor who spoke as part of the book festival in 2015 and reporter Ari Bermann with his book about the battle over voting rights in America.
Kenyon said the City of Literature invited every presidential candidate with a book to town for the 2015 festival. Most of those candidates were Republican. None of them came "in part from the idea that people in Johnson County aren't interested in hearing from that end of the political spectrum," Kenyon said.
"That was unfortunate, because our goal, then and now, is to introduce ideas into the public forum to initiate or further conversations about the issues that face our community and our country, and we all would benefit from hearing from all points along the political continuum as we do that work."
Prairie Lights also has a history of bringing politicians to town for readings, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, for a reading at the bookstore in February of 2015, followed by another at the University of Iowa's Hancher Auditorium in August 2017. Former Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry and other candidates have also appeared at the bookstore.

AJC 5:30 CHALLENGE HARISSA CHICKEN: Sheet-pan supper meant for weeknight: All-on-one-pan meals promise ease and speed.

Texto completo: When it comes to weeknight dinner, there are few styles of recipes more appealing than sheet-pan suppers.
Lauded by proponents as quick, all-on-one-pan meals, these recipes promise ease and speed. Truthfully, they rarely deliver on both.
Even those recipes by sheet-pan supper hero Melissa Clark of The New York Times, are often fussy and require marinating times and a shopping list's worth of garnishes.
These recipes are fine if you've got more than an hour to get dinner on the table, but they're not exactly 5:30 Challenge material, unless you do some serious editing.
This week's recipe does just that. Consider it a heavily redacted version of Clark's recipe for harissa-spiced chicken and potatoes, showered with fresh herbs and a yogurt sauce. To streamline and speed up the recipe, eschew bone-in chicken for boneless thighs; these cook in less than 15 minutes in a hot oven.
And cut out the spices. Rely instead on the very best harissa you can find in your grocery store, such as Mina spicy red harissa, found at Kroger.
To speed things up, give the potatoes a head start in the microwave while you preheat the oven and prepare the chicken and the yogurt sauce (which is, by the way, just whole milk yogurt seasoned generously with salt and pepper). For the herbs?
Pick out one of your favorites -- cilantro, mint, parsley or dill all work -- or use a combination of whatever you've got on hand that needs to be used.
Once everything is in the oven, wipe down the counter and microwave a bag of frozen peas to serve on the side if you'd like.
Or skip 'em and keep your dinner truly one-pan.

SHEET PAN HARISSA CHICKEN THIGHS AND POTATOES
11/2pounds baby potatoes
Extra-virgin olive oil, for the potatoes and chicken Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs

Carnegie Hall Season To Focus on Beethoven

Texto completo: What do you get the composer who has everything? More everything.
Beethoven hardly lacks for exposure, but to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth, in 1770, Carnegie Hall announced on Wednesday that it would go all in, and devote roughly a fifth of its 2019-20 season to his music.
All his piano sonatas. All his string quartets. Lots of his chamber music. And not one but two cycles of all nine symphonies: one performed on period instruments, with John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, and another on modern instruments, with Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the Philadelphia Orchestra.
"We all feel this is really the pivotal figure in the history of Western classical music," Clive Gillinson, Carnegie's executive and artistic director, said in an interview. "Everything he touched, he changed and transformed."
Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who became music director of the Metropolitan Opera this season, will be the subject of a Perspectives series that will give New Yorkers a chance to hear him conduct all three of his ensembles: the Philadelphians, the Met Orchestra and the Orchestre Métropolitain of Montreal. The mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, the singer-songwriter Angélique Kidjo and Mr. Gardiner will also have Perspectives series, and Jörg Widmann will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair.
There's a lot to chew on in the season, which will open Oct. 3 with Franz Welser-Möst conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, and will end June 21 with Daniel Barenboim and the Vienna Philharmonic. So here is a tip sheet, with critics and writers for The New York Times highlighting some of the concerts that intrigue them next season.
MUNICH PHILHARMONIC ( O CT . 25-26) AND BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (NOV . 8-9)
ORCHESTRE MÉTROPOLITAIN (NOV. 22) AND ORCHESTRE SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTRÉAL (MARCH 24) The season brings a couple of battle-of-the-bands moments. Most halls would be happy to import a single orchestra from Munich or Montreal, but Carnegie is bringing a pair from each city. So New York audiences will be able to contrast performances of Valery Gergiev conducting the Munich Philharmonic with those of Mariss Jansons leading its neighboring Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. And they will be able to compare the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, under the baton of Kent Nagano, with that city's lesser-known ensemble, the Orchestre Métropolitain. MICHAEL COOPER
AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA, NOV. 13 This ensemble's reliably excellent taste results in a program that features new orchestrations of Ives songs by Hilary Purrington and Hannah Lash, as well as the premiere of a guitar concerto by Ms. Purrington. Her recent "A Clarion Call" is packed with haunted harmonies and riotous humor that Ives might well have admired. SETH COLTER WALLS
IRISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, NOV. 19 Unique synergies often develop when an orchestra is led by a composer-performer. In his collaboration with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, Jörg Widmann, as conductor and solo clarinetist, serves up a meticulously balanced program with compositions that showcase his debt to Bach ("Versuch über die Fuge") and rock ("180 beats per minute") alongside works by Mendelssohn, Weber and Mozart's own Bach-flavored Adagio and Fugue in C minor. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
CONRAD TAO, NOV. 20
KIRILL GERSTEIN, FEB. 20
IGOR LEVIT, MAY 5 A great way to refresh repertory staples is to perform them alongside new and recent works. The brilliant young pianist and composer Conrad Tao offers a particularly bold example of this approach in his solo recital at Weill Recital Hall, which fascinatingly juxtaposes the old (Bach, Rachmaninoff, Schumann) and the new (David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Jason Eckardt). At Zankel Hall, the formidable Kirill Gerstein will play unusual works by Liszt, Brahms and Gyorgy Kurtag steeped in Hungarian dances and folk song, as well as pieces by Haydn, Busoni, Bartok (the flinty, seldom-heard Piano Sonata), Thomas Adès and, to end, Schubert's exuberant "Wanderer" Fantasy. Igor Levit will join Carnegie's Beethoven salute in Stern Auditorium with Sonatas No. 9, 10 and 11, and the still-astounding "Hammerklavier." ANTHONY TOMMASINI
SO PERCUSSION, DEC. 7 The program for this virtuosic and often mind-opening quartet, "A Century of Percussion," is something of a greatest hits concert. They will revisit pieces like David Lang's "the so-called laws of nature," Steve Reich's "Music for Pieces of Wood" and John Cage's "Third Construction." But the evening will also include the local premiere of a new work by Julia Wolfe. JOSHUA BARONE
ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE, FEB. 19-24 There is hardly a shortage of recordings of Beethoven's symphonies, but the one I inevitably turn to is John Eliot Gardiner's vigorous, colorful, altogether vital cycle with this period-instrument ensemble. After a pair of crack Berlioz performances at Carnegie this past fall, this team is surely ready to put the old Ludwig van through his paces. ZACHARY WOOLFE
THE CROSSING, MARCH 25 Such is their radiant sound and the vibrancy of the repertory they've cultivated, it's gotten to the point I'd hear anything this Philadelphia vocal ensemble sings. At Carnegie they'll join the cellist Maya Beiser, whose charismatic cross-genre experiments have seductive savvy, in the New York premiere of Michael Gordon's "Travel Guide to Nicaragua." ZACHARY WOOLFE
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, APRIL 15 After presenting Act II of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" at Carnegie last spring, the Bostonians will be back, under the baton of Andris Nelsons, for Act III. These two concerts are a test drive for the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who has been gradually rolling out his Tristan. (Other cast members include Emily Magee as Isolde and Günther Groissböck as King Marke.) JOSHUA BARONE
QUATUOR ÉBÈNE, APRIL 17-MAY 2 Even outside of anniversary years, cycles of the Beethoven string quartets mushroom all over the concert landscape. But this French ensemble, known for its passionate and rigorous playing, is sure to bring something special to its six-concert survey in the spring. Do stick around for the encores, which these players use to shoot off in unexpected directions with improvised takes on folk music, jazz or the Beatles. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
TIMO ANDRES, APRIL 29 Aaron Copland's mid-20th-century Piano Sonata is the oldest work you'll find in this solo recital, which features a wide range of pieces by contemporary composers like John Adams, Donnacha Dennehy and Frederic Rzewski -- and, of course, Mr. Andres himself. Later in the evening is a premiere from the young composer Gabriella Smith. JOSHUA BARONE
MAURIZIO POLLINI, MAY 17 There's enough Beethoven this season to last a lifetime, but it's a lifetime of Beethoven that Mr. Pollini, 78 years young, will bring to this performance of the final three piano sonatas. There's no artist I'd rather hear play this music. DAVID ALLEN
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC, JUNE 19-21 Poor Mahler, with just six performances of his symphonies next season at Carnegie. I wouldn't want to miss Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the Sixth in his farewell performance at the hall before stepping down as music director of the San Francisco Symphony (March 18), but Daniel Barenboim has a peculiar, productive way with these scores that makes these concerts more promising than the norm. He leads the Fifth, Seventh and Ninth. DAVID ALLEN

Texto completo: Let the sordid saga of Kevin O'Brien, a former right hand to Mayor de Blasio, serve as an instruction manual on how not to handle the aftermath of #MeToo job departures - and a spur to employers to step up to their moral obligation to serve as a warning system to others.
As excavated by the New York Times, the scandal of O'Brien's hush-hush departure from City Hall early last year after two substantiated allegations of sexual harassment wasn't the first. Unbeknownst to de Blasio or the city Department of Investigation, which vets job candidates, O'Brien had left his previous job, with the Democratic Governors Association, under disturbingly similar circumstances.
DOI asked if O'Brien had caused any trouble. None, came the reply. Nor did his patron, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock - who admits he knew about the misconduct - mention anything to de Blasio, a pal.
Seriously? Any verified bad behavior should have gone straight into the guy's HR file.
De Blasio still can't even bring himself to say that he would have warned O'Brien's next boss of the harassment if he'd been asked for a reference - only, wink-wink, that "he resigned in lieu of termination."
This isn't that hard. The law gives an employer leeway to alert those about to hire their former workers about a history of harassment, provided they've made a good-faith effort to investigate the facts and don't go blabbing about them to anyone and everyone.
Two supposed leaders failed. Others must do better.

Texto completo: “Perhaps there is one book for every life," Katharine Smyth writes in the first sentence of her memoir, “All the Lives We Ever Lived." For her, that book is Virginia Woolf's “To the Lighthouse," and as if to prove her point she braids readings from it with threads of her past to create a reflective meditation on loss, childhood, memory, home, and art.
Smyth's account is only obliquely about herself; though the narrator, she's a shadow character in a story that's mostly about her father. She recalls her childhood with her parents in Boston and Rhode Island but writes equally vividly about her father's life in London and Cambridge before she is born. She is equal parts daughter and reporter, describing her father's larger-than-life persona, his alcoholism, his career as an architect and financial struggles, his marriage to her mother, and his long illness and eventual death during her early adulthood. Throughout, she draws on “To the Lighthouse" as well as Woolf's other writing and biography, using them as windows into her life and mind.
“All the Lives We Ever Lived" is a quiet book and, like its literary touchstone, an intensely interior one. In one close reading of a scene, Smyth observes that Woolf is the master of “moments that hold up a mirror to our private tumult while also revealing how much we as humans share." The same can certainly be said of Smyth, who expertly dissects the finest gradations of emotion in any given scene: the moment her father tries to drunkenly discuss one of his favorite novels with her, for example, while she brushes her teeth. She turns him away, then wishes he'd come back, then thinks of his impending death, then goes to sleep.
Smyth is a restrained writer. She exposes intimate details of her own world and that of her parents but omits more than she shares. This is especially true of her life away from her family; we only get the contours. Perhaps one of the most moving moments in the book — a chills-down-the-spine moment — comes early, in a chapter on courtship and marriage, both that of her parents and of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. She writes, “When I was thirty, I married a man I'd dated for five years; four years later, he left in the middle of the night, and I never saw him again." She hardly mentions this again.
Her reticence coupled with her candor are refreshing. It's a model of writing about oneself that emphasizes focus and control over unbridled openness. Some of the best scenes — like Woolf's — are richly descriptive of the external world: “From the basin to the river to the bay to the sea: At the edge of the Atlantic, we lost sight of the land, so the world seemed naught but sky and water, and we the center, always the center."
Given all the similarities — the death of a parent, a life shaped by water and houses — it's no surprise that Smyth turns to “To the Lighthouse" as the book for her life. “All the Lives We Ever Lived" joins a genre that's in vogue: memoir that blends the personal with literary criticism, and sometimes history. Leslie Jamison's “The Recovering" falls into this category, as does Maggie Nelson's “The Argonauts." When done well, this approach can be illuminating; art backlighting the contradictions and tangles of a life.
In the case of “All the Lives We Ever Lived," this approach sometimes works. The strength lies in Smyth's gifted critical reading — the close, multifaceted dissection of Woolf's words. She can turn a passage inside-out. As a frustrated tutor once noted while she was studying abroad at Oxford she has a keen “intuitive sense of Woolf," if not a consistently scholarly one. That blend of the critical and the emotional enlivens our sense of Woolf and of her.
But like many books that trade in both memoir and criticism, Smyth's is somewhat lopsided. The passages about her own life tend to be the most compelling. The constant and predictable shift to Virginia or Mrs. Ramsay can feel like a downturn. There is rarely an elegant way to mesh these dimensions together, which is perhaps why a writer like Nelson used a more fragmentary approach, letting things hang together as they will.
Still, “All the Lives We Ever Lived" is a powerful book, driven by the engine of Smyth's controlled, rich description. It's an astonishingly clear-eyed portrait of a person through myriad lenses, a kind of prismatic attempt to capture a life.

Texto completo: A standing ovation for abortion? That’s what New York’s Reproductive Health Act got in the Senate chamber when it passed last week. Lawmakers and bystanders stood and applauded a law that legalizes abortion all the way up until birth, for any reason.
The left may be celebrating the bill’s passage, but it is wildly out of step with American sentiment on the issue. American support for late-term abortion continues to decline; one poll last year found that a mere 13 percent of Americans support abortion all the way into the third trimester. And most Americans don’t think abortion is something to celebrate, or “shout” to borrow from the pro-choice lobby's public relations campaign. A majority of Americans, in fact, say abortion is immoral.
I can only imagine then, that seeing Democrats vigorously applaud abortion for 7-pound babies makes most Americans queasy. The same goes for lighting up One World Trade Center pink.
Read more commentary:
March for Life: Science has changed since Roe v. Wade, now abortion laws must change
Supreme Court should rule against discriminatory abortions based on genetics, gender
I carried my dying daughter to term. It was a lesson in love many didn't understand
But the bill did more than extend abortion up until labor pains begin. The bill drops the requirement that only doctors perform abortion and decriminalizes violence against children in the womb. Even if it's by a woman's thug boyfriend.
"Safe" … scratch that. Legal and rare? Scratch "rare," too. In New York City, one in three babies are aborted.
In legalizing and then celebrating the brazen removal of protections for not just unborn children, wanted or unwanted, but women as well, New York dramatized something the left is increasingly struggling to hide: they are only interested in legal abortion, full stop. Safe and rare be darned.
Abortion extremism grows even as use fades out
Strangely enough, the left’s litany of extremism on abortion continues to grow as its political efficacy wanes. Just this month, Democratic leaders in Congress announced they would push to overturn the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, despite the fact that a solid majority of Americans support it. Co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. , promised the “boldest pro-choice legislation in history” and called the new Congress an opportunity to unleash a “a new era of reproductive rights. ”
It certainly is a new era, one in which the Democrats are further away from the American people on abortion than they’ve ever been in history, and one in which American views on abortion are more nuanced than ever before. A slight majority of Americans continue to support legal abortion, but primarily in the first trimester, and it’s something that makes them morally uneasy. Democrats who have been tossed out of office for their extremism on the issue can see this.
In a recent podcast interview with The New York Times, former Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-MO, who voted against the 20-week ban on abortion, lamented the party’s emphasis on the issue, saying Democrats should “shut up” about abortion. “It was not an issue that was going to bring me more votes,” she said.
The left celebrates death itself
No doubt former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N. D. , who became known as “High Five Heidi” for her infamous high-five with Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer after voting against the 20-week ban, would agree.
Already, the four women who have entered the presidential race for the Democratic party from the U. S. Senate have made their abortion bonafides plain: All are in the New York school of abortion extremism. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , gets special kudos for her efforts to undermine crisis pregnancy centers in her home state while acting as attorney general, before the Supreme Court stepped in to protect their free speech rights.
What happened in New York last week is somber and tragic. But it was a teaching moment for us all in that it made plain the left’s position on a deeply divisive issue. As the bishop of Albany wrote in a letter to his parishioner, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, pleading him not to sign the bill, “Do not build this Death Star. ”
The reality is that the left has moved past building Death Stars to celebrating death itself.

Upward Mobility: How a Billionaire Spends His Money Is His Own Business

Texto completo: What's with the New York Times and its Ken Griffin fetish?
Inside of a week, the Chicago hedge-fund manager who recently dropped $238 million on a 24,000-square-foot New York City penthouse has been featured in no fewer than three news articles. The purchase set the record for most expensive home sale in the U.S., so it's certainly newsworthy. But does it warrant a 1,700-word front-page article? And a second thousand-word story the following day? That depends on if you share the editors' progressive agenda.
The Gray Lady informs us that Mr. Griffin is worth around $10 billion, collects expensive art, and owns other pricey properties in the U.S. and abroad. A generous philanthropist, he's given away nearly three times as much money as he spent on his new residence. But the paper also wants us to know that he "has declined to join other billionaires in a pact to donate a majority of their wealth to charity" and that "critics" consider him "especially tone deaf" for "spending so freely at a moment when populist movements are gaining momentum around the globe." For good measure, we're told that the penthouse has been constructed on the site of a former rent-stabilized building. Apparently, the reader is expected to blame New York's affordable-housing troubles on Mr. Griffin and his ilk, not idiotic rent-control regulations that discourage developers from building middle-income apartments.
Suddenly, we're not reading real-estate porn anymore. The Times has shoehorned Mr. Griffin into yet another rant about stingy billionaires, income inequality and the supposed need for tax increases to expand the welfare state. A separate article even compares him unfavorably with a previous generation's ultrarich, "who had a prevailing sense that too much was distasteful." Examples include Brooke Astor, who "lived, until her death, in an apartment on Park Avenue that was not in excess of 5,000 square feet," and David and Peggy Rockefeller, who raised six kids in an Upper East Side townhouse that measured a mere 10,000 square feet. Actually, Astor died at 105 in one of her other residences, an 11,000-square-foot manor set on almost 65 acres in suburban Westchester County. And the Rockefeller estate, which is located nearby and occupies 3,500 acres of land, makes the Astor home look modest by comparison. Locals joke that "it's what God would have built, if he had the money."
How Ken Griffin and other wealthy people spend money is their business. But the left's determination to confiscate more of those dollars to redistribute to people they deem worthier concerns everyone. In a free-market system, society's most productive members tend to facilitate upward mobility for all of us, not just for themselves. And not only through their philanthropy.
Oil refining made the Rockefellers rich, but in the process, they made oil products much cheaper and thus more widely available to the poor. Prior to Standard Oil, whale oil and candles were a luxury that only the wealthy could afford. The rest had to go to bed early to save money, explains Burton Folsom, a professor of history at Hillsdale College. "By the 1870s, with the drop in the price of kerosene, middle- and working-class people all over the nation could afford the one cent an hour that it cost to light their homes at night. Working and reading became after-dark activities new to most Americans."
Rockefeller got rich and America got more productive. Henry Ford did something similar in auto manufacturing, as did Sam Walton of Walmart fame with respect to big-box discount stores. Bill Gates has done more for humanity creating his computer-software fortune than he will ever do giving it away through his foundation. Wealth creation plays a far bigger role than philanthropy or government transfer programs in improving our standard of living, something that those forever trying to "stick it to the rich" either don't understand or choose to ignore out of political expedience.
Convinced that more affluent members of our society have succeeded at the expense of the poor, progressives are insisting that Democrats make income inequality a campaign theme in 2020. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says "there's plenty of money in the world" but "it's just in the wrong hands." New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports a 70% top-marginal tax income tax rate and says "a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don't have access to public health is wrong." Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wants a 2% "wealth tax" on people with assets above $50 million.
History provides no evidence that Ken Griffin's wealth is somehow responsible for poverty in the Deep South, or that wealth-transfer schemes help the poor. We'll find out soon enough whether the Democrats' class-warfare rhetoric can convince voters otherwise.

LAUSD teachers should exercise their Janus rights, not follow their union off a fiscal cliff

Texto completo: Despite the recent settlement of the Los Angeles teachers strike, mostly in the teacher union’s favor, the deal largely ignores the shaky financial realities of the school district. While the union crows about its apparent victory, the potential fiscal disaster should make teachers consider leaving the union, not rallying around it.
In addition to a 6 percent raise for teachers, the settlement deal includes more staff at schools and a cap on class sizes. Yet, the district’s finances mean that the deal is built on quicksand.
As the New York Times pointed out, “the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million to pay for the additional staff members.”
Further, the district can only afford the deal if it can pass a local parcel tax in 2020 and receive increased state funding from Sacramento.
These glaring financial questions clash with the district’s current bottom line.
For example, state law requires the district to maintain a minimum 1 percent budget reserve, and the district has a structural deficit, spending more than it takes in.
That structural deficit will soon end up causing the district to dip below the state-mandated 1 percent minimum.
Los Angeles County Office of Education superintendent Debra Duardo recently told the education group Speak Up, “it’s gotten to the point where [the district] can’t show us that they can maintain a 1 percent reserve in their third year out.”
The County estimates that by 2021-22, “the district will be bankrupt.”
Duardo points out, “Especially at a district as large as LAUSD, if they were to go insolvent, then they would be in really big trouble.”
What kind of trouble? For teachers, here is the chilling warning.
The district, says Duardo, “would actually run out of the cash they need to pay their teachers and all of their salaries.”
Duardo explains that a budget reserve is a one-time pot of cash, and “that’s not money you [will] have [again in the future].”
In response to a question about the district giving in to the union’s demands, Duardo is clear about the ramifications: “The law is set up where if they were to show us in their budget that they don’t have enough money to maintain that reserve, and even go further into the negative — which would concern us that they may be at risk of becoming insolvent — then the next step would be for us to assign a fiscal advisor.”
The kicker: “And a fiscal advisor has stay-and-rescind authority, which means that if there are decisions being made that put the district at risk of becoming insolvent, then we could override decisions that the board is making.”
The union claims that the district is not deficit spending, but Duardo points to the simple fiscal fact that the district’s reserve is plunging, so if there were no deficit spending “we wouldn’t see this reserve dwindling down to below 1 percent.”
The new settlement deal, therefore, may be a Pyrrhic victory for teachers that could cause harm to them and their students.
Instead of blindly following their union, teachers should consider taking advantage of their new rights under the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which held that public employees cannot be forced to pay dues or fees to unions.
Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the Janus majority opinion, wrote that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of public employees to require them “to provide financial support for a union that ‘takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.’”
L.A. teachers should make use of their Janus rights and walk away from the union, not walk with it over a cliff.

Texto completo: During a recent meeting, Decatur commissioners unanimously rejected a development that would've placed 43 townhomes on Church Street immediately south of Glenlake Park.
Mayor Patti Garrett said her personal issues with the plan include: stormwater runoff(the townhomes would get constructed at and near the bottom of a long hill), pedestrian safety on a busy street and the developer's reluctance to conduct a traffic study, required by Decatur's Unified Development Ordinance.
"I was also concerned that there had been no public input (meetings)," Garrett said. "I can't remember a project that came forward and that we approved where the developer had not done some community (outreach)."
The named developer is The Quarters Decatur LLC.
The city's planning commission had also rejected the plan earlier in January.
The development would cover 2.54 acres that currently have nine single-family homes, all abandoned. Quarters Decatur has all nine under contract but hasn't yet purchased them.
Quarters Decatur is either subsidiary of or falls under the larger Thrive Homes, which also wants to redevelop a 35,719-square-foot building at Park Place and East Lake Drive, currently owned by AT&T, into 34 multifamily units. Although a conditional use permit for that project was approved by city commissioners last November, an attorney representing a group called Green East Lake claimed AT&T didn't have the "authority" to sell the land. That project remains in limbo.

Texto completo: Florence Knoll Bassett, an enormously influential architect and designer who changed the look and feel of corporate offices with a "total design" concept through open floor plans, spare, straight-edged desks and furnishings, and a devotion to aesthetic simplicity, died Jan. 25 at her home in Coral Gables, Fla. She was 101.
Her death was confirmed by David E. Bright, a spokesman for Knoll International, the design and furniture company she once led.
Ms. Knoll Bassett studied with several leading architects of the 20th century, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, whose emphasis on straight lines and a lack of ornament became a hallmark of her designs, as well.
Although she designed some buildings, Ms. Knoll Bassett was best known for her reimagining of interior space as she cleared away old ways of thinking along with the heavy desks and draperies that had cluttered offices for years.
"I am not a decorator," she repeatedly said. Rather, her aim was to apply architectural principles to the part of buildings where people spend most of their time: the inside.
For more than 20 years, Ms. Knoll Bassett was the design director of Knoll Associates, a company she formed in the mid-1940s with her first husband, Hans Knoll. Her daring use of materials, texture, color and space - corresponding with the international style of architecture prevalent at the time - was considered revolutionary and came to embody what is now called mid-century modern design.
One of Ms. Knoll Bassett's earliest projects was her husband's 144-square-foot office, which she made into a showcase of minimalist simplicity. As potential clients stepped inside, they beheld a new vision of design that soon reshaped corporate buildings around the world.
In 1984, long after Ms. Knoll Bassett had retired, New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote that she "probably did more than any other single figure to create the modern, sleek, postwar American office, introducing contemporary furniture and a sense of open planning into the work environment."
Ms. Knoll Bassett made office space a conscious artistic statement. Before putting pencil to paper, she interviewed workers - not just the bosses - to understand how they spent their time and moved around the office.
Then she made a "paste-up" model out of cardboard, showing every chair, table, lamp and typewriter. She used the exact paint colors and fabric samples and, when everything was in its place, folded the flattened model together to create a three-dimensional replica of the office.
Ms. Knoll Bassett's papers, now in the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art, include remarkably detailed, hand-drawn designs. Next to a pencil sketch of drinking glasses, for instance, she wrote: "Bright sparkle on glasses. Look all right?"
Her office designs were done with an eye toward comfort, efficiency and ease of movement and communication - and with an underlying ethos that good taste could have a beneficial effect on the workplace.
Every square foot counted. Instead of a monumental desk in the middle of the floor or cutting off a corner, Ms. Knoll Bassett shrank its size, removed the drawers and placed it toward the rear of the room. Papers were stored in a small credenza against a wall. Chairs were lightweight and easy to move. She liked staircases without risers, giving the illusion of walking on air.
Depending on the size of an office, the focal point could be an oval or rectangular table, standing atop slender metal legs, or a sofa shorn of armrests and curves. Walls were sometimes painted in a bold primary color or covered in cloth.
Another of her innovations, now commonplace, was to staple fabric swatches on pieces of cardboard, fanning them out like a deck of cards for clients to see.
"She has led people to see that texture in fabrics can be as interesting as a print (she dislikes prints)," journalist Virginia Lee Warren wrote in the Times in 1964, "and that steel legs on tables, chairs and sofas can have grace and elegance."
Ms. Knoll Bassett was, Warren concluded, "the single most powerful figure in the field of modern design."
Over the years, she worked on offices at General Motors, IBM, Rockefeller Center, the Heinz headquarters in Pittsburgh and New York's Seagram Building, designed by her mentor, Mies. Ms. Knoll Bassett's final major project, completed in 1965, was the interior of the CBS headquarters in New York, for which she designed everything from tables, desks and chairs to wall coverings and door handles.
As design director and later president of the Knoll company, she hired renowned architects and sculptors, including Isamu Noguchi, Harry Bertoia and Eero Saarinen, her friend from childhood, to design chairs, tables and sofas.
Ms. Knoll Bassett's own designs launched trends in office decor, including an oval-shaped desk with a thin sheet of marble or wood floating atop a simple chrome pedestal. In the first dozen years after the table was introduced in 1961, more than 3 million were sold.
When Saarinen designed a line of chairs with a molded fiberglass base, Ms. Knoll Bassett persuaded a skeptical New Jersey boat manufacturer to make them.
"We came with a model of the chair," she told Metropolis magazine in 2001 in a rare interview, "and he looked at it and thought maybe we were a little crazy, but he was a nice guy. We sold him on the idea of making this chair, and then it became a very good part of his business."
Florence Margaret Schust was born May 24, 1917, in Saginaw, Mich. Her father ran a family baking company, but both of her parents died at early ages, leaving her an orphan at 12.
A guardian enrolled her in a private girls school outside Detroit. An art teacher there once asked what project she was interested in.
"I want to design a house," she said. She soon came to the attention of Eliel Saarinen, an acclaimed architect - and father of Eero Saarinen, the chief designer of Washington's Dulles Airport and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. The elder Saarinen, who was also headmaster of the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., became a mentor to Ms. Knoll Bassett (who was known to friends as "Shu") and practically made her a member of his family.
During the summers, she traveled with the Saarinens to their native Finland and met other renowned architects. She studied at Cranbrook and Columbia University and had internships with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. She attended the Architectural Association in London, then trained under Mies at what is now the Illinois Institute of Technology, from which she graduated in 1941.
She then joined an architecture firm in New York, but as a woman she was often relegated to designing the interiors of buildings rather than the structures themselves. In 1943, she began working with the German-born Knoll, who was running a New York branch of his family's furniture business. They were married in 1946.
After her husband was killed in a car accident in Cuba in 1955, Ms. Knoll Bassett became president of the company. Her work later took her to Miami to design the interior of the First National Bank building. In 1958, she married Harry Hood Bassett, who became the bank's president.
She sold the Knoll business in 1959 but stayed on as design director until 1965. She occasionally worked on private projects but largely led a private life in Miami.
Her husband died in 1991. Survivors include three stepchildren and nine grandchildren.
In 2000, Ms. Knoll Bassett donated her papers to the Archives of American Art - and designed the containers to hold them. She received the National Medal of Arts from President George W. Bush at a White House ceremony in 2003.
A year later, Ms. Knoll Bassett's work was featured in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. At age 87, she created a cardboard paste-up model of the display space, meticulously planning the layout and selecting fabric samples, the typeface for the wall panels and even the paint colors for the walls - red and blue.
She made several visits to Philadelphia to watch over the installation, then - in a typical act of public reticence - did not attend the opening.
"We thought we were perfectionists at the museum," curator Kathryn Hiesinger later said, "but no one is like Florence Knoll Bassett."

Texto completo: TIANJIN, China - If President Trump's tweets are sometimes puzzling in English, just imagine trying to translate his idiosyncratic prose into Chinese.
Total hoax, lap dogs, Mr. Magoo, horse face, smocking gun, presidential harassment, angry Dems, steel slat barrier, total sham, Scott Free, fake news, covfefe. Much of it defies the laws of semantics and grammar, making translation a challenge.
But that is Zhang Jiaqian's mission. Every day, he spends several hours trying to render the U.S. president's tweets into Chinese, and writes a commentary far longer than 280 characters to explain them.
"I think this is a public service to Chinese people. Chinese people need to understand him," Zhang said during a break from his day job at a medical device company in Tianjin, southeast of Beijing. He asked not to disclose the name of the company, fearing his employer would not look kindly on his extracurricular activity.
"If we want to win the trade war, if China is going to make the right policies, we need to understand Trump," he continued in passable English he taught himself. "He may be reelected in 2020, so we may have to cope with him for a long time."
Zhang began a page on WeChat, a Chinese social media app, in April when the trade battle was beginning. He thought it would be a good way to inform Chinese people what Trump was saying through his tweets.
It was difficult at the beginning, because Zhang needed to learn about American politics, American history, American personalities and American idioms. He is clearly a quick study. He drops Dan Scavino, Trump's social media director, into conversation and riffs on Republican Ron DeSantis's win in the Florida gubernatorial race.
But he found that he couldn't just translate Trump's tweets. He also had to provide context. "If I just translated his Twitter, no one would understand it."
What Trump conveys in a word takes Zhang whole sentences to contextualize. He had to introduce his followers to Stormy Daniels. "Pocahontas" was particularly time-consuming. To explain why a Kardashian was visiting the Oval Office, he had to first explain what a Kardashian was.
And Trump's pejorative nicknames lose much of their zing in the translation.
"Cryin' Chuck" Schumer becomes "Chuck the Weeper" and "Crooked Hillary" is "Hillary the Liar." James B. Comey, instead of being a "total sleaze," becomes "outright despicable."
Then there's the "manipulated and nauseating political persecution" instead of Trump's "Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt." The ubiquitous "Fake News" becomes the much less catchy "made-up news."
This newspaper, however, gets something of an upgrade, becoming the "Amazonian Washington Post," while the New York Times is not "failing" but merely "decaying."
"Democrat spin machines" becomes "Democrat lie generators" in Chinese.
"Pocahontas": "The colluding Indian woman Bo Ka Hong Ta Si."
"America First": "America takes precedence."
"Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe": "Elizabeth Warren's acting was terrible in the beer video."
Zhang's most popular post was about Trump's complaint that it was too expensive to have a military parade in Washington, so he would go to France to watch its parade. "Many people are critical of how much money China spends on parades, so they liked that the U.S. is being frugal," Zhang said.
China has a small but active online community of Trump supporters who use the Chinese version of "libtards" - that's the "white left" - and champion the U.S. president's policies.
But Zhang said he is not translating the U.S. president because he's a supporter necessarily, but because he's doing a public service.
"Trump writes his foreign policy and his domestic policy on Twitter," Zhang said. "It is very important for Chinese to know what he wants to do with the relationship between the U.S. and China. His policies can affect China significantly."
That said, however, there is one subject that Zhang does not translate. The one that Chinese people would doubtless be most interested in: China.
"When he criticizes China, it's sensitive," Zhang said. "The Chinese government doesn't like China being seen as the bad guy. So I just don't translate those tweets."
He did not tell his followers that Trump tweeted in December: "Did China ask us if it was okay to devalue their currency" and "build a massive military complex?"
"I don't think so!" Trump wrote.
Nor did Zhang try to translate the president's assertion that "I am a Tariff Man."
He also didn't attempt to explain that Trump talked about last month's truce in the trade war as a "BIG leap forward" - not to be confused with the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous Communist Party policy that led to crippling famine and tens of millions of deaths in the early 1960s.
On China's highly censored Internet, these kinds of discussions are fraught with difficulty. Individual posts can be blocked, but so, too, can entire accounts.
Zhang tried to skirt these sensitivities. But censors closed his first WeChat account, called "Trump's Twitter Governance," in October. This was part of a crackdown that led the cyber administration to block almost 10,000 social media accounts for violations such as "spreading politically harmful information."
Zhang set up a new account with a more subtle name. It's called "Kaopu English," or "Trustworthy English," as though it were a language learning page. But "kaopu" can also be interpreted as "Things About Trump."
What's more, Zhang refrains from calling the U.S. president by his official Chinese transliteration of "Te Lang Pu." He instead refers to Trump as "Chuan Pu," with an intentional typo to further try to avoid censorship.
He says he will continue trying to explain the U.S. president to his followers as long as he can keep his account alive.
For all Zhang's efforts, there is one pronounced aspect of the president's tweeting style that is definitely lost in translation: his quirky use of capital letters. Chinese doesn't have uppercase and lowercase letters.

Texto completo: For the last month and a half, no one has been discussed more as the Lakers’ mythical second superstar as much as Anthony Davis.
As of Monday morning, that pipe dream seems a little closer to reality.
ESPN reported that the 6-foot-10, five-time All Star has officially requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans, where he’s spent the first seven seasons of his career. While the Pelicans would be able to offer Davis a supermax contract extension this summer with an estimated value of $240 million, Davis’ agent, Rich Paul, has said that he won’t sign an extension, preferring instead to compete for a championship.
With the 22-28 Pelicans now dealing with an unhappy superstar, the expectation is that the Lakers will attempt to muscle into the bidding before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. While ESPN reported that New Orleans does not want to deal Davis before the summer – when more suitors such as the Boston Celtics will be available – now is the Lakers’ best chance to land one of the best two-way players in the NBA.
Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who had sworn in front of Los Angeles media a month ago that New Orleans would not trade Davis, adopted a less rigid posture as he addressed reporters after practice on Monday morning.
“Obviously it’s in the open and everyone knows,” Gentry said. “For us, it’s business as usual.”
Davis has been named to the All-NBA first team three of the last four years. Averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots this season, Davis will turn 26 in March. The dream of pairing a superstar entering his prime with LeBron James, who is still producing prime-level numbers, is an enticing one for the Lakers, who desire a return to the NBA’s biggest stage for the first time since 2010.
It was an earth-shaking announcement in New Orleans, where the Pelicans released an official statement confirming the report while saying they would make any given trade on their own timeline.
“Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline,” the statement read. “One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.”
Mention of tampering seems to carry a specific edge toward the Lakers: The organization has been fined twice for tampering under the Magic Johnson-led front office. The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that the NBA was investigating tampering concerns regarding Davis, though not specifc to any one team.
But that hasn’t stopped the speculation that Davis will one day be a Laker.
Some of the most hotly discussed trade assets the Lakers have are their own promising young players: Kyle Kuzma (19.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg); Lonzo Ball (9.9 ppg, 5.4 apg); and Brandon Ingram (16.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg). Kuzma is 23, while Ball and Ingram are 21. All are still on their rookie deals with the Lakers.
Other potential trade assets include 23-year-old guard Josh Hart (8.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and 21-year-old center Ivica Zubac (8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg), who has been on the rise in recent weeks. The Lakers also control their first-round draft picks for the foreseeable future.
If the Lakers were to make a trade, they’d likely also have to include one of their higher-salary players to come close enough on Davis’ $25.4 million salary. Aside from James, some of the highest-paid Lakers included Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($12 million, but with power to veto a trade) and Rajon Rondo ($9 million).
James has welcomed the idea of playing with Davis, a possibility he called “amazing” back in December. Paul also serves as James’ agent.
The implications of a trade for Davis also reached the Lakers’ practice Friday, but they appeared just as stoic. Ingram said trading for Davis would be “good for the Lakers, or whatever team that gets him,” but maintained that players have been shutting out the persistent trade rumors that the roster could be totally upheaved.
“It feels that (speculation is) on the outside of what’s in this gym,” he said at the team’s training facility. “I think you look on social networks and look on everything else, you have all these stories of this player, this player, this player. But no one in this room, or the players, or the coaches, or the general manager doesn’t say a word about it. … We only listen to the important people in this building.”
It’s worth noting that even though the Lakers’ core players are young, they’ve done plenty of cycles through the rumor mill near the trade deadline. Ball, Kuzma and Ingram were also widely discussed over the summer as possible assets in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who later was traded to the Toronto Raptors.
Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

Texto completo: Congressional Republicans are suffering, as I have noted in the past, from a bad case of Stockholm syndrome. They've seen what's happened to "the formers" who crossed the bully in the White House -- e.g., former senator Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and former representative Mark Sanford, R-S.C., -- and all they can think is: There but for the grace of God... . Not even the loss of 40 House seats in 2018 and President Trump's wretchedly low approval numbers can shake his iron grip on their fragile psyches. It's as though their kidnapper had left them alone in the house, but they're too scared to step outside.
Republicans did not have to wait 35 days to end the pointless government shutdown. They could have cooperated with Democrats to keep the government open, if they had been willing to cross Trump. But only six Senate Republicans were willing to do so. Now, Republicans could send a strong signal to Trump that they will not support the misuse of his "emergency" powers to build a border wall that has not been funded by Congress. But while some Republicans have spoken out, others, such as the opportunistic Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., have actually encouraged the president toward a reckless usurpation of Congress's power of the purse.
Republicans also could have passed legislation to revoke the president's authority to levy tariffs by absurdly labeling allies such as Canada a national-security threat. But even though most Republicans are uneasy about Trump's tariffs, they haven't acted to stop his protectionist outbursts.
The Senate Judiciary Committee actually passed bipartisan legislation to prohibit special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., refused to give it a floor vote. Now, Sens. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have introduced a bill that would compel the Justice Department to publicly release Mueller's report. Good luck getting a vote from a majority leader who seems to view the World's Greatest Deliberative Body as a wholly owned subsidiary of America's Least Deliberative President.
Another piece of legislation that McConnell can easily bottle up, should he so desire, is a bill, approved 357 to 22 by the House last week, that would prevent Trump from pulling out of NATO. All but 22 House Republicans voted for it, and Senate Republicans would be hard-pressed to vote "nay," given that NATO membership has been a bedrock of American foreign policy for 70 years. But McConnell may save his fellow Republican senators from making what is -- to them -- a difficult choice between the president's pro-Russian prejudices and the dictates of national security.
When confronted with that very choice on Jan. 16, only 11 Senate Republicans dared to defy Trump. The vote was on the administration's decision to lift sanctions against Rusal and two other companies owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska -- a one-time employer of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a close confederate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Deripaska remains personally sanctioned, but, after an intensive lobbying campaign by Deripaska's companies, the Treasury Department struck a deal to lift sanctions on them in return for a reduction of his ownership stake to below 50 percent. The justification for this move was the impact on the global economy if sanctions were imposed on the world's second-largest aluminum manufacturer, but there are other ways to keep aluminum prices from spiking. Trump, for instance, could lift his destructive steel and aluminum tariffs.
Instead, the Treasury struck what appears to be a sweetheart deal with Deripaska. The New York Times, which obtained a copy of the confidential agreement, reported that it "may have been less punitive than advertised," because "the deal contains provisions that free [Deripaska] from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company." A former Treasury official who was not involved in the case told me that it was "shocking" that the U.S. government would approve such an agreement, because it "does not follow the spirit of the legislation or stated policy objectives and sets an incredibly bad precedent for weak enforcement."
It was entirely appropriate that 136 House Republicans joined with Democrats to override this flawed deal. But in the Senate, the bill fell three votes shy of the 60 needed, because supposed hawks such as Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in addition to Graham, failed to support it. Even Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, -- who in 2012 described Russia as "our No. 1 geopolitical foe" and in 2016 called Trump a "con man" who was unfit to be president -- refused, in the crunch, to vote against said con man and said geopolitical foe. With sanctions now lifted, shares in Deripaska's companies have shot up, handing the oligarch and his friends at the Kremlin a nice windfall.
This is not putting America First. This is putting Trump First, and it has become an unfortunate habit that congressional Republicans need to break. The only thing they have to fear is fear of Trump itself -- what President Franklin Roosevelt aptly described, in another context, as "nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror."

The Shutdown and the Federal Workforce; To apply public pressure, essential workers had to furlough themselves.

Texto completo: News consumers may find it odd that coverage of the partial shutdown of the federal government was largely devoted to the shutdown's impact on employees of the government itself rather than on the lower-paid citizens they are supposed to serve. New estimates of the economic impact of this longest-ever shutdown and a closer look at the events that brought it to an end may provide an explanation. A remaining question, as the private economy demands workers as never before, is just how overstaffed the federal bureaucracy really is.
The Congressional Budget Office reports today on the modest economic impact of the shutdown during the end of last year and the start of this one--an impact that will be offset in the future:
In subsequent quarters, GDP will be temporarily higher than it would have been in the absence of a shutdown. Although most of the real GDP lost during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates that about $3 billion will not be. That amount equals 0.02 percent of projected annual GDP in 2019. In other words, the level of GDP for the full calendar year is expected to be 0.02 percent smaller than it would have been otherwise.
The affected agencies were operating without nearly half of their normal staff--some 380,000 furloughed workers deemed non-essential--and the economic impact was not material to the $21 trillion U.S. economy.
The essential government workers were not necessarily operating at full speed either. In fact, those eager to end the shutdown couldn't muster the necessary political pressure on the White House until some of the workers deemed essential started furloughing themselves.
Sarah Jones writes in New York magazine:
Trump announced his deal hours after air traffic controllers brought flights in several of the nation's busiest airports to a crawl. Controllers have missed two paychecks -- as have hundreds of thousands of other federal workers and subcontractors. Hours after the Federal Aviation Authority announced severe delays at LaGuardia, Newark, and Hartsfield-Jackson airports, Sara Nelson, the head of the flight attendants' union, publicly urged her members to mobilize "immediately" against the shutdown by visiting the offices of their congressional representatives. "If air traffic controllers can't do their jobs, we can't do ours," she told New York on Friday.
Air traffic controllers and flight attendants didn't act alone. The Washington Post reported that 14,000 IRS workers did not show up to their (unpaid) jobs this week. Previously, multiple outlets reported a spike in the number of TSA agents calling out of work sick -- though they were not sick, at least not in the physical sense...
Workers bore the cost of the shutdown, and it shouldn't surprise anyone that they began to revolt. By withholding their labor, they redirected the pain the Trump administration had inflicted upon them. Their actions were not strikes in the formal definition, because that option is not legally available to most workers affected by the shutdown.
Airline delays were needed to apply pressure to a public that largely failed to notice the impact of a prolonged closure of significant parts of the government. Even in the industry most affected, the results were hardly catastrophic. Andrew Tangel and Alison Sider of the Journal reported last week:
Some of the biggest U.S. airlines warned passengers would soon face worse delays and more canceled flights if the partial federal government shutdown drags on further.
American Airlines Group Inc. Southwest Airlines Co., Alaska Air Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. on Thursday said they could increase their revenues in the first quarter despite the shutdown. Shares in American and Southwest climbed more than 6% and JetBlue rose over 5%.
Should it have been this hard and taken this long to identify a problem resulting from a prolonged shutdown affecting numerous federal agencies? In theory, government employment is for the purpose of delivering public services, as opposed to a jobs program for well-educated people who don't want to make things or sell things.
There is certainly no need for a federal jobs program, as the private economy remains in dire need of workers. The Journal's Sarah Chaney noted last week:
Initial jobless claims declined by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 in the week ended Jan. 19, the Labor Department said Thursday. This marks the lowest level for claims since November 1969, when applications clocked in at 197,000.
Here's hoping that after budget negotiators resolve their border arguments they'll find time to help at least some federal workers pursue new opportunities in the private sector.

Mrs Trump's father was not a fearsome presence and did not control the family. Mrs Trump did not leave her Design and Architecture course at University relating to the completion of an exam, as alleged in the article, but rather because she wanted to pursue a successful career as a professional model. Mrs Trump was not struggling in her modelling career before she met Mr Trump, and she did not advance in her career due to the assistance of Mr Trump.
"... Mrs Trump met Mr Trump in 1998, not in 1996 as stated in the article. The article also wrongly claimed that Mrs Trump's mother, father and sister relocated to New York in 2005 to live in buildings owned by Mr Trump. They did not. The claim that Mrs Trump cried on election night is also false," Telegraph, Jan. 26

Texto completo: KABUL--U.S. and Taliban negotiators have forged a preliminary deal on two vital points to end the war in Afghanistan, the special U.S. envoy said Monday, as the Afghan president urged the insurgents to negotiate directly with his government.
Washington agreed on the withdrawal of its approximately 14,000 troops from Afghanistan while the insurgents vowed to halt any terrorist attacks abroad from Afghan soil, said a person briefed by a Taliban participant in the talks last week in Qatar.
U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad told local media on Monday that the two sides had struck "agreements in principle on a couple of very important issues." He gave no details other than to say the U.S. was working with the Afghan government and others to get to a comprehensive cease-fire.
There are still major hurdles to a final peace accord to end America's longest war.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani insists that the Taliban negotiate face-to-face with the government. "I call on the Taliban...to heed the will of the Afghan people and enter serious talks with the government of Afghanistan," Mr. Ghani said in a nationally televised address from the presidential palace in Kabul on Monday.
But the talks didn't include the Afghan government, with which the insurgents have long refused to negotiate, viewing it as an American puppet. The ultraconservative Islamist movement had no immediate response to Mr. Ghani's call.
A U.S. defense official on Monday also urged caution, saying that talks were far from over and that plans for a complete American withdrawal were premature. The U.S. military also has said it wants to maintain some troops in Afghanistan focused on counterterrorism operations.
Testifying to the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Jack F. McKenzie Jr., the new head of U.S. Central Command, said Afghanistan's security forces were still weak. "If we left precipitously right now, I do not believe they would be able to successfully defend their country," he said.
Talks over a peace deal have been propelled by reports, most recently last month, that President Trump was prepared to withdraw U.S. forces unilaterally. The administration has since said the president hadn't decided to draw down troops in Afghanistan nor had he ordered the Pentagon to do so.
But experts on the insurgency say the reports galvanized Taliban efforts to get an agreement while there are still troops in the country and to get something for the war they have waged.
As momentum toward a peace deal has grown, government officials have expressed concerns U.S. and international pressure will build on the Kabul administration to forgo upcoming presidential elections and instead to form an interim administration while Afghans, including the Taliban, negotiate new political arrangements in the country. Such interim rule might undermine Mr. Ghani's hopes for another term as president.
In his comments to local media, Mr. Khalilzad said he didn't discuss an interim government with the Taliban, but those assurances were unlikely to assuage the fears of Mr. Ghani and other senior officials in his government.
The talks in Qatar last week were adjourned to give time to technical experts to draw up detailed plans for a withdrawal and a cease-fire, the person briefed by a Taliban participant in the Qatar talks said. They are expected to resume in Qatar in late February.
Mr. Ghani has insisted that negotiations to end the 17-year Afghan war must be "Afghan-led and Afghan-owned." In his address Monday, he sought to portray the U.S. negotiating effort as part of his government's peace plan, which he unveiled at a gathering of foreign officials and diplomats in Kabul in February 2018.
"The efforts of the United States in regards to peace is part of our peace plan," said Mr. Ghani, who earlier this month announced his plans run for another five-year term in office in elections set for July.
But after Washington's diplomatic efforts to end the war resumed in July 2018 and then accelerated five weeks later with Mr. Khalilzad's appointment as special envoy, the Afghan-born diplomat appeared to decide that making progress in U.S.-Taliban negotiations first would create the momentum needed for talks among the Taliban, the government and political parties over a power-sharing administration and changes to the constitution urged by the Taliban.
Mr. Khalilzad has briefed Mr. Ghani and his aides regularly by about his progress in the talks, but they have chafed over what they see as their exclusion. Mr. Khalilzad told the New York Times on Monday: "We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement."
Last month, the government's efforts to participate in the U.S.-Taliban negotiations reached their nadir, when two top officials in Mr. Ghani's government were excluded from a round of talks in Abu Dhabi after Mr. Khalilzad had invited them, according to a senior Afghan security official.
In his remarks, Mr. Ghani also said his government wanted a peace deal quickly with the Taliban, whom he described as being in the grip of "enemies." That was a reference to Pakistan, which played a key role in the formation of the Taliban in the mid-1990s and has continued to use them in varying degrees since then to exert influence in Afghanistan.
He also said that no Afghan wanted foreign troops in the country "for a prolonged period" and that his government was seeking to reduce their number to zero based on a "comprehensive and regular plan," a plan, he said, that would prevent the outbreak of the kind of anarchy that has afflicted past transitions of power in Afghanistan.
There are about 14,000 U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, about 5,525 of whom support air operations, train Afghan special forces and carry out counterterrorism operations, according the most recent figures provided by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.
The remaining American personnel are assigned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's mission to train, advise and assist Afghan security forces, a force totaling 16,229 people from 39 Nato and non-NATO partner nations, the inspector general says.

The Associated Press
PRIMGHAR, Iowa - Constituents applauded Republican Rep. Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman's first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over controversial comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month.
King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist.
The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the House voted, 424-1, to rebuke him, with King himself voting in favor of the resolution, and Republican leaders denied him any committee assignments.
Addressing what he called "the elephant in the room" in his opening remarks at Saturday's event, King expressed frustration that his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy in the Times interview led to even his fellow Republicans disowning him.
"It is stunning and astonishing to me that four words in a New York Times quote can outweigh 20-some years of public service, 20-some years of giving you my word every day," King said. "And not one soul has stood up and said I've ever lied to you or misrepresented anything. Not one soul has stood up and said Steve King has ever acted in a racist fashion, that he ever discriminated against anybody."
King has long been known for making caustic comments, especially on issues related to race and immigration. Shortly before the November election, the Washington Post reported that King met in Austria with the far-right Freedom Party, which has Nazi ties. King said the meeting was with business leaders, including one person from the Freedom Party, but the Post stood by its story.
Although King's recent comments drew a relatively large media contingent to Saturday's meeting, none of the constituents who were on hand said anything critical about the controversy and a couple expressed their support, telling King they think he's doing a great job. In the few instances in which King's history of insensitive comments and his most recent statements arose, the audience seemed supportive, and they stood twice during the gathering to applaud him.
Pamela Harrman criticized what she called a "progressive movement to change our country" and said liberals can say anything while conservatives are demonized when they speak out.
Harrman said she supported King and shook her head at other Republicans "all bailing out on you."
Lori Scroggin added, "We support you and support your conservatism."
People mostly wanted to talk about the issues of governing, asking King about efforts to allow more corn-based biofuels in gasoline, economic development and changes that would allow people to temporarily enter the country legally to work on cattle operations. King didn't take questions from reporters.
Such town hall meetings have been unusual for King, who for years declined to hold them. He argued that he could meet with constituents more effectively by speaking with them privately rather than at public gatherings, which he claims would be dominated by opponents from outside the district.
However, after his narrow victory over Democrat J.D. Scholten, who for months traveled in a motor home throughout the district, King announced that he would hold town hall meetings in all of the district's 39 counties.
Only two months after King's narrow win, he drew a conservative and likely well-funded Republican primary challenger in state Sen. Randy Feenstra, an assistant Republican legislative leader known for pushing a large tax cut through the 2018 Legislature. Last week, Woodbury County supervisor Jeremy Taylor, a former state legislator, announced he'd also seek the 4th District GOP nomination. At least two others have said they are considering running in the Republican primary.

Texto completo: A defiant Roger Stone denounced the "Gestapo tactics" of federal authorities Sunday and denied the allegations against him two days after being arrested by the FBI on seven felony charges, including witness tampering, obstruction and lying.
The charges against the longtime political operative and associate of President Donald Trump stem from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Stone is charged with lying about his role in the Trump campaign's attempts to communicate with WikiLeaks about Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents.
Stone, 66, denied doing anything wrong, calling the indictment against him "thin as piss on a rock" during an interview on ABC's "This Week. " He said his emails and texts that the special counsel used against him in the indictment were taken out of context.
He called the manner of his arrest – which took place in a pre-dawn raid at his Florida home Friday – "extraordinary. " He said the number of agents who were involved was unnecessary because he does not own a firearm and does not pose a flight risk because his passport is expired.
Post-indictment: Stone mocks Mueller with doctored photo on Instagram
Russia investigation: Mueller pushes deeper into Trump campaign
Who is Stone? Longtime Republican operative worked on campaigns from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump
"I've been under investigation for two years. I have destroyed nothing. But if I were going to destroy evidence, wouldn't I have done it a long time ago?" he said. "They could simply have called my lawyers, and I would have turned myself in. "
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , did not share Stone's dismissive attitude of the indictment against him.
"Look, he’s presumed innocent. But these are very specific allegations of lies and witness intimidation. They’re matters that will be easily provable," said Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on "This Week" after Stone's interview. "And I think he’s going to need a much better defense than the one you just heard. "
Schiff, a former prosecutor, said white-collar criminals often dismiss each individual piece of evidence as innocent and explainable while trying to get investigators to ignore the "totality" of the evidence.
Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who also worked as a prosecutor, agreed.
"The fact of the matter is that every white-collar defendant in this circumstance, when they’re confronted with a bunch of documents of their own making, try to say that they're out of context," said Christie, who added that Stone faces a "pretty damning indictment. "
After his arrest, Stone was released on $250,000 bail.
Stone claimed the FBI made "an expensive show of force to try to depict me as Public Enemy No. 1, the O. G. ," he said, using the acronym for "original gangster. "
"It's an attempt to poison the jury pool," he said. "These are Gestapo tactics. "
Stone said that everything he said or wrote about the Clinton campaign emails in 2016 was based on what had been made public and that he had no advance knowledge about what WikiLeaks would publish.
In the indictment against Stone, Mueller's team alleges that "a senior Trump campaign official" was directed to talk with Stone about further WikiLeaks releases. Stone said he believes that official was Rick Gates, an associate of former campaign manager Paul Manafort.
Stone said Gates is lying if he is the one claiming such a conversation took place.
"I never spoke about this matter with Rick Gates. But I'm mindful of the special counsel's ability to induce people to say things that are not true, particularly people who are seeking a reduction in their sentence," he said.
Gates pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy and lying to investigators. As part of his plea deal, he testified against his former business partner at Manafort's trial in August about helping file false tax returns, failing to disclose multiple foreign bank accounts and providing fake documents to banks to acquire millions of dollars in loans. Gates may have cooperated with Mueller in other parts of his investigation.
Mueller investigation: Key players in 2016 election inquiry
Stone implied former White House adviser Steve Bannon might be behind the claims in the indictment because he has an "ax to grind. "
"I urged the president to fire Steve Bannon," Stone said. "I suspect that I am not his favorite person. "
Stone said he "categorically" never spoke to Trump about WikiLeaks, Russia or the Mueller investigation.
He said the investigation into where the emails came from is "meant to distract from the content of those emails, which demonstrated the corruption and dirty tricks of the Clinton campaign. "
Stone said it was an "unproven" claim that Russians stole those emails and he compared himself to Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, who exposed White House dishonesty about progress in the Vietnam War.
"I tried to do the same thing that Daniel Ellsberg did, for which The New York Times and The Washington Post called him a hero, although I never received any stolen or hacked material and handed it to anyone," he said.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. , did not agree that there was anything heroic about WikiLeaks' publication of the stolen emails.
"I think it should have been clear to people a long time ago that WikiLeaks and others like that could have been tools of foreign intelligence used to divide America," Rubio said on "Meet The Press. " "And so I do believe that anyone who is cooperating with them, wittingly or unwittingly, is doing the work of a foreign intelligence agency to harm us. "
Stone vowed outside the federal courthouse Friday that he would "not bear false witness" against the president, but Sunday, he did not rule out the possibility of cooperating with Mueller.
He said that was something he would have to "determine after my attorneys have some discussion. "
"If there’s wrongdoing by other people in the campaign that I know about, which I know of none, but if there is, I would certainly testify honestly," Stone said.
"I’d also testify honestly about any other matter, including any communications with the president," he said. "It’s true that we spoke on the phone, but those communications are political in nature, they’re benign, and there is certainly no conspiracy with Russia. "

Texto completo: If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were a conservative, all anyone would be talking about is how uninformed she is. She would be facing trick questions from reporters designed to expose her lack of knowledge, and brutal sketches on "Saturday Night Live" mocking her intelligence and fitness for office. Instead, SNL fawns over her, while CBS's "Late Show" host Stephen Colbert — far from making jokes at her expense — eats ice cream with her and asks how many "f---s" she gives about her critics.
Boy, it's good to be a socialist.
It's not that there is a lack of material. This week, for example, Ocasio-Cortez declared that "the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change." She has said that $21 trillion in "Pentagon accounting errors" could pay for most of her massive $32 trillion Medicare-for-all plan — as if there were $21 trillion in unspent tax dollars sitting around in a Pentagon vault. She opined that "just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn't even ask for" — unaware, apparently, that the entire Pentagon budget is $716 billion. She wrongly claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement "is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009" — when ICE is required only to have that number of beds available and that number has remained flat. She has declared that "unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs" — which is flat untrue. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only 6 million to 7 million Americans with two jobs and 148 million with just one.
Those are examples of ignorance. But apparently she is also dishonest. This week, she told Colbert that she has not been able to open a district office yet to handle constituent casework because of the federal government shutdown. "There's a lot of things we can't do as freshman members," she said. "We can't properly set up our district offices. We can't get laptops delivered. We can't start doing the work that we were elected here to do. ... It takes the green stuff. And those workers are furloughed." That's wrong. Last September, Congress passed the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, which funds congressional salaries and offices for the coming year. Ocasio-Cortez knows this because, unlike furloughed workers, she is getting paid. The New York Times reports that the three other first-term members from New York have managed to open offices in their districts. A more likely explanation is that Ocasio-Cortez is spending her time building her national media profile instead of taking care of the constituents who sent her to Washington in the first place.
So where are the articles bemoaning "The incredible, thuggish stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"? Where are the journalists trying to trip her up with questions like "Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine?" to see if she knows what it is? Nowhere to be found. To their credit, the fact-checkers have been on the case. PolitiFact gave her unemployment claim a "Pants on Fire" rating, and she is rapidly accumulating a large cache of Washington Post Pinnochios — so much so that she claims to be the victim of "false equivalency + bias." Give me a break. She told CBS's "60 Minutes" that "being morally right" is more important than "being precisely, factually ... correct." Apparently, facts matter less as long as you support Big Government.
But facts are crucial, especially when you are proposing the largest increase in government spending in human history. Vox recently added up the cost of all her proposals — from Medicare-for-all, to free college, guaranteed jobs and the "Green New Deal." The price tag was $42.5 trillion over the next decade — more than twice the current national debt. Sorry, you can't pay for that through Pentagon accounting errors.
It is a tremendous testament to America that someone who was working as a bartender in a Mexican restaurant a year ago can throw their hat into the ring, unseat a 10-term member of Congress and be elected to the House of Representatives. It's what makes this such an exceptional nation. And it is obvious that she has political talent. But that doesn't excuse her from the responsibilities as a legislator to learn the facts and serve her constituents. Even Whoopi Goldberg, an Ocasio-Cortez supporter, warned her on "The View," "I would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job."
That's good advice. Once people decide you are ignorant, it's hard to recover — just ask Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. Of course, they were conservatives, so the standards are different.

Racial disparity, charges for resisting arrest linked in NC

Texto completo: ASHEVILLE – The charge of resisting an officer, sometimes called "resist, delay, obstruct," or simply RDO, has been scrutinized around North Carolina and the country for racial disparities and links to police use of force.
In Harnett County, between Raleigh and Fayetteville, a squad of sheriff's deputies with a high number of resist charges in 2014 and 2015 was shown by the Raleigh News & Observer to have a penchant for violent arrests. The U.S. Department of Justice stepped in, opening a criminal investigation. Residents, including the family of a man killed by a deputy, brought a federal lawsuit.
In Greensboro, where black residents make up 42 percent of the city's population, police made the resist charge by itself 836 times against African-Americans from 2009-13, according to the New York Times. That was four times the number of standalone RDOs against white people, at 209. Those numbers, coupled with racial disparity in traffic stops, led police in 2015 to announce they would stop pulling over motorists for minor infractions involving vehicle flaws.
In Fayetteville, Police Chief Harold Medlock said he instructed his officers to avoid resisting-an-officer charges unless some more serious offense also occurred, the New York Times said.
"I tell my folks, if that's all you have, don't charge somebody. Find a way to move them on down the road," Medlock said.
A UNC Chapel Hill study showed 51 percent, or 1,338, of resist charges were made against black people throughout North Carolina from Feb. 13 to Aug. 11, 2015, despite a statewide African-American population of 22 percent. In that same half year, white people were charged 1,150 times, a rate of 43 percent, according to the study headed by political science professor Frank Baumgartner, a specialist in racial disparities in traffic stops. Baumgartner said he and graduate students were working on a more complete analysis.
Outside of North Carolina, RDOs played a role in a federal lawsuit against Ferguson, Missouri, where police treatment of black residents spurred national changes in racial politics. Black people received 92 percent of resist charges at time the population was 67 percent African-American, former federal prosecutor Chiraag Bains said.
"These incidents — sometimes called 'contempt of cop' cases — are propelled by officers' belief that arrest is an appropriate response to disrespect," said the 2015 U.S. Justice Department report co-written by Bains.

Penn Badgley thinks his 'You' character is a creep

Texto completo: Not everyone loves going to work, so it's only fair that actors will sometimes sour on the characters they portray. That's the case for Penn Badgley, who has been on the receiving end of a flood of amorous messages from thirsty fans of his Lifetime turned Netflix show "You" imploring him to "kidnap me, pls."
Those messages get a little creepier once you realize his character is a murderer and all-around bad guy. Though he enjoys portraying the complex character (and will continue to do so in Season 2), he's not exactly thrilled that fans have taken to romanticizing the fictional stalker. To that end, he's done his best to shut down these lusty crushes online.
But it got us thinking: What other actors hated their iconic characters, and why? Turns out, it's more common than you might think - and everyone loathes in their own distinct way.
The godfather of hating your own character
It's the rare occasion that an actor's detestation for his character actually makes for a better performance - but that's exactly what happened with Harrison Ford's breakout role in the first three Star Wars movies.
"As a character he was not so interesting to me. I thought he should have died in the last one, just to give it some bottom. George [Lucas] didn't think there was any future in dead Han toys," he told ABC in 2010, the same year he told MTV of the character, "I'm done with him."
"The character kind of mocks the movies that he's in," Ryan Britt, author of "Luke Skywalker Can't Read," told The Washington Post in May. "You always got the impression that he didn't really care. . . . You always got the impression that he could literally walk out at any second, and not in a prima donna kind of way, just in an 'I'm done' kind of way."
Strange as it might sound, many feel this actually improved the movies.
"He's what makes these films different, because he's a skeptic," Chris Ryan, editorial director of the Ringer, told The Post in May. "You don't really have that in 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Trek' or 'Game of Thrones' - the person who's just like, 'I don't believe any of this crap.' He was able to take this arcane, mythology-sci-fi dialogue and make it sound like it was from a guy on the street. It showed that Star Wars was not otherworldly, even while some of that stuff was foreign to us."
The Judas of hating your own character
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark, the rapper decided to give acting a go. His breakout role came in Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights" as porn star Dirk Diggler, who spirals into drug addiction as he climbs the adult film ladder. The movie is considered a classic and among Wahlberg's best screen work.
Though the then-young actor seemed to relish in the role at the time, his opinion has changed. A devout Catholic, Wahlberg told a crowd in Chicago that he now regrets some of his films - especially "Boogie Nights."
"I just always hope that God is a movie fan and also forgiving because I've made some poor choices in my past," he said of the movie.
Later, he clarified the comments to People: "I was sitting in front of a couple of thousand kids talking about and trying to encourage them to come back to their faith, and I was just saying that I just hope he has a sense of humor because I maybe made some decisions that may not be okay with him."
The queen of hating your own character
Katherine Heigl is no stranger to speaking her mind about movies - even, or perhaps especially, the ones in which she appears. About "Knocked Up," in which she co-stars, she told Vanity Fair: "It was a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight. . . . Ninety-eight percent of the time it was an amazing experience, but it was hard for me to love the movie."
That example merely led to Seth Rogen's hurt feelings, but some argue her comments about the story arc of her "Grey's Anatomy" character, Izzie Stevens, led to her dismissal from the show.
After winning an Emmy in 2007 for the character, Heigl refused to submit her performance for consideration in 2008, calling her character's story line "a ratings ploy."
"I did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization, I withdrew my name from contention," she told the New York Times. "In addition, I did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials."
This infuriated much of the show's cast and crew, and she eventually left the show in 2010 as rumors that she was "difficult" to work with swirled around the gossip rags. There's probably some truth to that, given that showrunner Shonda Rhimes praised the actors on her show "Scandal" by saying, "There are no Heigls in this situation."
The 007 of hating your own character
One of Hollywood's dream roles is James Bond. The work is consistent, lucrative and part of the silver screen's fine history. Someone should probably mention this to Daniel Craig, who despises playing the character.
He hates the role so much that fans wondered who would be the next Bond. After all, Craig told Time Out London in 2015 of reprising the role: "I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on."
"If I did another Bond movie," Craig added, "it would only be for the money."
Everyone wondered who might be next: Tom Hardy, Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, [insert any living male British actor here]. When the question was floated by Craig, he simply said he didn't care who took up the mantle.
So who's the next James Bond? Looks like someone needed money because Craig has, indeed, reprised the role for the 25th installment of the series, due out in 2020.
The Michael Jordan of hating your own character
Robert Pattinson despises his iconic "Twilight" character, Edward Cullen, with a fury unlike any other. Pattinson has complained throughout so many interviews about Edward, the century-old telepathic vampire who falls for Kristen Stewart's Bella (a witch or something), that there's an entire Tumblr feed dedicated to his most (self-) scathing comments.
Among his harshest words: He has said "Twilight" "seemed like a book that shouldn't be published." That "if Edward was not a fictional character, and you just met him in reality - you know, he's one of those guys who would be an ax murderer." He called his performance "a mixture of looking slightly constipated and stoned."
Once, when asked which "co-worker helped make your 'Twilight' experience the most rewarding," all he could muster was a nearly minute-long pause, followed by "huh, my uh, oh I can't think of anything. I would say SK-II face packs," referring to facial cream.
Toward the end of his run as Edward, Jimmy Fallon said to Pattinson: "There's millions of 'Twilight' fans out there that just cannot wait to see [the final movie]. It's almost heartbreaking because they don't want it to be over. It's a little bittersweet, isn't it?"
"For them!" the actor replied.

Texto completo: Too many political journalists and talking heads compare presidential primary elections to horse races. Predictably, they are now using the old racing expression "And they're off!" to describe the upcoming campaign season.
The truth is that the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, while wide open now, begins with a set of candidates who have developed their own beliefs and accomplishments long before they entered this race. And before they arrive at the homestretch, the most exciting part of every race, primary voters will get a good chance to learn everything they need to know.
Already there is hand-wringing among some Democrats over the size of the field. Knowing panels of "experts" on CNN, MSNBC and Fox have all opined that the large field will make the process clumsy and confusing for primary voters.
The New York Times recently listed eight candidates who are "running," two who are "all but certain," four who are "likely to run" and eight who "might run." So far, there are five women, at least a half-dozen minority candidates, a handful of candidates just above the required age to be president, a few senior politicians and an openly gay Navy veteran who served in Afghanistan.
Together they look like America. Democratic primary voters are smart enough to figure this out, in spite of what the talking heads say.
Even more candidates could enter the race. And they should. This time the process counts for a lot, and it must be wide open and fair. If the Democrats hope to win, every voice must be heard in a process that unites instead of divides.
You can be sure that the Russians and Chinese will not respect this process, and you can count on them doing all they can to foment division among Americans. And the press will not be able to stop itself from handicapping the race, breathlessly touting those candidates more likely to build ratings and sell time.
But the Democrats must not weaken. If they begin to look for shortcuts to a more manageable field or tighter control, they only have to remember the last presidential race. The Democratic candidate was a foregone conclusion in 2016, leaving many average Democrats feeling that they had no role in picking their candidate. They were right.
Neither major party can be called a political machine anymore. Even the power of congressional leaders has been curbed, their political grip loosened by populist voter blocs and online campaign fund raising.
This time, every community and cause must be heard. Americans who care about health care, the environment, tax reform, immigration, income inequity, voting rights, criminal justice, transgender rights, the disabled or the revival of organized labor -- those who have been ignored or trampled -- must be part of this race.
As for those Democrats who worry that "you can't beat somebody with nobody," they should be celebrating and not wringing their hands. Whoever ends up on top after this process will surely be "somebody." And that "somebody" is likely to be a candidate who reminds us of the things we love about America.

Michael McGrady column: Government shutdown has no economic justification

Texto completo: Officially, Trump has single-handily presided over the country's longest partial government shutdown. As a result, thousands of federal workers are either furloughed on extended leave or must report to work without pay until funding is resumed. Meanwhile, Congress and the executive branch continue to have one of the most damaging partisan fights of Trump's tenure: Fund the ill-conceived border wall, or key agencies won't receive the funding they need to pay employees, conduct regulatory actions, or commit to normal day-to-day operations.
According to JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, the partial government shutdown could have a negative effect on the entire economy. Though he predicts that any recession yet to come won't be as damaging as the Great Recession, Dimon remains adamant that Trump's shutdown politics and his overall trade and economic policies could see a noteworthy decline in the markets.
Dimon cited an assessment in the New York Times, by economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, that analyzes the potential economic effect if the government shutdown lasts the entire first quarter of the year. Shepherdson believes that if the government is partly shuttered for the first quarter, any economic growth during that period would be virtually wiped out.
The same Times report further indicated that the White House didn't expect the economic effect from the shutdown would be so negative and immediate.
Historical trends suggest that shutdowns have minimal effect on economic growth; however, that trend could be snapped as this shutdown is now affecting a series of regulatory bodies that allow for certain commercial segments to operate within legal compliance. On the fronts of the consumer and the business owner, uncertainty abounds as many across the United States now feel the grip of the shutdown while realizing how invasive the federal government truly is.
Cases of the government shutdown impacting commerce can be seen when it comes to the distribution of services contracted by the government through private corporations. Additionally, the regulatory frameworks could come to a halt in several industries beyond the immediate case presented here and the adjacent private sector tied to federal contracting."
In a commentary for MarketWatch, Cato Institute's Chris Edwards writes: "The problem with the shutdown is not that President Trump is holding the government 'hostage,' as House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, but that the government has taken hostage of too much of the U.S. economy."
These comments couldn't be more valid. This shutdown further reveals how much the power of the federal government has grown. Edwards characterizes this extension of power as an octopus. I characterize it as a virus. I don't discount the benefits of sound, market-friendly regulation and consumer protection measures, but, there is a line that's been crossed. Too much regulation forces businesses and consumers to rely on the government to provide certain services.
Michael McGrady is a political consultant and public policy researcher. He wrote this piece for InsideSources.com, which publishes opinion and analysis from the decision makers who understand the issues and shape policies.

An opening for a party of reality to address true problems

Texto completo: Here they come, the newly resurgent Democrats, ready to take on "the man" (Rep. Rashida Tlaib); protect America's middle class from "attack" by big corporations and billionaires (Sen. Elizabeth Warren); provide "Medicare-for-all" (Sen. Kamala Harris); offer universal pre-K (Julian Castro); and fight capitalism in general without any idea of how it works (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). The Democratic Party is lurching to the left like a confused American driver on a British highway.
As The New York Times' Thomas Edsall notes, it isn't just leaders who are stampeding to the port side. Democratic voters are becoming more liberal, too. In the past 17 years, Pew Research has found, the percentage of Democrats who described themselves as liberal jumped from 30 to 50 percent. This is reflected in issue positions. In 2008, the percentage of Democrats who agreed that immigrants here illegally should be permitted to become citizens was 29 percent. That increased to 51 percent in 2018. Between 2010 and 2017, the portion who said "racial discrimination is the main reason many blacks can't get ahead these days" rose from 28 percent to 64 percent. (Notably, among white liberals, 79.2 percent agreed that discrimination was the main thing holding blacks back, whereas among black respondents, the percentage was lower — 59.9 percent identified discrimination as the obstacle to progress. Hmm.)
The liberal nostrums on offer are utterly disconnected from the actual challenges the nation faces. It's hard to see how the "war on the middle class" theme can get traction in an economy with 3.9 percent unemployment. Poverty has been declining and middle incomes have been increasing since 2013. Jobs are plentiful. Median household income reached $61,372 in 2017, which is higher than comparable countries like Canada, Germany, France, Britain and Denmark, and exceeded only by a handful of tiny rich nations sitting on oil (Norway) or numbered bank accounts (Switzerland and Lichtenstein). U.S. median household size, meanwhile, has declined, so individual wealth has increased even more than the income numbers reflect.
Admittedly, facts need not impede a good political pitch. Republicans have succeeded by offering their own fractured fairy tale about what ails the nation. They've insisted that we are being overrun by illegal immigrants, when border apprehensions are at an 18-year low. They assert that immigrants bring crime, which is false. They've claimed (along with some progressives like Bernie Sanders) that outsourcing has decimated U.S. manufacturing, when the real story is that automation has been the chief cause of lost manufacturing jobs. And they've claimed globalization has hollowed out the middle class when, in truth, global trade, while costing some jobs, has created far more and provided middle-income Americans with a bounty of affordable products, thus improving their standard of living.
Republicans and Democrats alike encourage victimhood. We need a party that will address the true problems we face.
As a governing matter, our greatest problem is that we are not behaving like citizens but like consumers. We are gorging on entitlements and washing them down with tax cuts. The bill? What bill? We can always borrow more! Medicare's trust fund runs out in 7 years. Social Security's in 15. But what the hell, let's have free college! Bartender, let's have another tax cut, but this time for the middle class! (By the way, what ever happened to that pre-election pledge?)
Any individual who behaved the way our nation does would be obese and broke.
Also, we are living in a civic cesspool. Our language, our manners and our hatreds are out of control and out of proportion to our problems. We are marinating in mutual contempt and suckers for conspiracy theories. Do you think the Covington High imbroglio was bad? Wait until deep fakes come along. These video impostures can make any politician (or anyone else) appear to say anything. Imagine the kids at the Lincoln Memorial having racial slurs put into their mouths by video manipulation.
It's not that our problems are so intractable; it's that our spirits are so sour. We desperately need some uplift, some commitment to the rule of law, more suspicion of centralized power, and a stab at trust. It's a lot to ask of a political party, and frankly, most of our problems, like the decline of families and churches, are pre-political. But leadership is important, and the majority of Americans are not at the extremes. A recent survey found that 54 percent of Democrats would like their party to be more moderate. And two of the most popular Republican elected officials are Maryland's Larry Hogan and Massachusetts's Charlie Baker.
That's a start.

REVIEW --- Editor at Large: From Covington Catholic to An Uneasy Davos

Texto completo: There's a delicious irony in the headline that the New York Times gave its first story about the Covington Catholic affair this week: "Boys in 'Make America Great Again' Hats Mob Native Elder at Indigenous Peoples March."
We now know that this was not only false but a fabrication manufactured from the richly embroidered skeins of bias that uncoil each day from the minds of predisposed journalists. It also misidentified the mob. The only hate-spewing gang that gathered last weekend was the media crowd that beat unrecognizable and left for dead the reputations of a group of teenage schoolboys whose sole offense was that they were white, apparently Trump supporters and, best of all, Catholic -- a group toward whom hatred is routinely legitimized and sanctioned by leading politicians.
The whole sorry event should be a seminal moment in the evolution of news. It neatly underscores how far many "reporters" have strayed from a core -- perhaps the central -- objective of journalism: to challenge what is supposedly clearly visible. The only interesting news to report is the story that's not obvious, the picture that not everyone can see. When a received version of events bursts into public view, the response of the thoughtful journalist isn't to pile on with the outrage. It's to stop and look skeptically and ask if there's another angle.
You think it's likely? Me neither.
The Covington story didn't penetrate much into the consciousness of the people gathered this week in Davos, Switzerland, where I've spent the last few days at the annual World Economic Forum meeting.
The gathering was defined more by notable absences: President Trump, fighting a rear-guard action to salvage some political capital from the wreckage of the government shutdown; Theresa May, desperately trying to construct some kind of habitable Brexit from the charred timbers of her ill-fated deal; Emmanuel Macron, figuratively penned up in the Elysee Palace as the yellow vests swarm around him. Carlos Ghosn, the deposed chairman of Renault-Nissan, was another familiar face not here, for a different reason. One of the few world leaders who did come was the newly triumphant populist Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and he rather oddly stayed and spoke for about seven minutes.
All of these absences are a useful reminder that there are strengthening political forces in many countries that are steadily overwhelming the globalist dreams of the folk who come here.
The Davos gathering has for a while now had a slight feeling of a besieged fortress, where the world's business, political and cultural establishment comes to reassure each other that, despite the rising hum of the angry crowds beyond the walls, everything will be OK. Throw them a few crumbs of rhetorical concern about inequality and economic insecurity, chant a few mantras about the need for a more inclusive global economy, and we can go back to what really gets our juices flowing: competitive virtue-signalling on the planet's climatological peril or the urgent need to widen cultural diversity. They go away, girded to face the unruly world, comforted in the knowledge that their historically unmatched material and cultural privilege will be secure for another year at least.
The mood among those who came this year was uneasy. Gone was the optimism about global "synchronized growth" from last year. Gone was a glimmer of belief that escalating prosperity might be enough to see off the barbarians at the gate.
Above all, China looms on everyone's horizon. And not mainly because of fears of trade war. Most of the CEOs, Wall Street crowd and others I spoke to seemed to think a trade deal between President Trump and President Xi Jinping was likely. The real fear is manifest in a mounting sense that this is a mere skirmish in a more consequential struggle for the world over the next decade.
For many people here, the passing of the years is marked in Davosian time. One participant captured the sense of foreboding well: "Last year's Davos felt like 2006. This year's feels like 2007." Those years, of course, marked respectively the peak of the frenzied optimism of the last business cycle and the first chilling presentiments of what was to come. We all know what 2008 brought.

Texto completo: Roger Stone, a GOP political operative and longtime friend and adviser to President Trump, was in frequent contact with members of Trump's campaign about WikiLeaks' efforts to release materials damaging to Democrats before the 2016 election, according to an indictment filed against him Friday.
Stone was arrested Friday morning on seven counts of obstruction, lying to Congress and witness tampering related to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the election.
A major focus of the probe has been whether Stone coordinated with WikiLeaks or its founder, Julian Assange, as the group published thousands of Democratic emails that prosecutors say were hacked by Russian operatives.
Stone was not charged with any crimes related to communicating with WikiLeaks about its activities, and he has repeatedly denied that he conspired with the group.
But the 24-page indictment against him details numerous occasions when Stone claimed to campaign officials that he had information about WikiLeaks or was in contact with Assange - and it depicts Trump aides and allies as acutely interested in learning about the group's plans in advance.
Among those who sought information from Stone, according to the filing, was a "senior Trump Campaign official" who "was directed" by an unnamed person to contact Stone as soon as WikiLeaks began publishing Democratic emails in the summer of 2016.
Stone also communicated about WikiLeaks with "a high ranking Trump Campaign official," whose emails in the filing match those of former campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon. And Stone received a query about the group's activities from a "supporter involved with the Trump campaign," whom he then asked to communicate via a secure messaging app, according to prosecutors.
In all, Stone interacted with at least four people close to the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks, according to the indictment.
The numerous interactions show that Trump allies were eager to leverage the hacked Democratic emails to their advantage - and that they saw Stone as someone with inside information useful in that effort.
The details in the court filing undercut Stone's past statements - including remarks in an interview he gave to The Washington Post last fall, in which he denied discussing WikiLeaks with Trump campaign officials.
"There are no such communications," Stone said at the time.
Stone has also repeatedly said he had no advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans and was just passing along public information and tips.
In an interview Friday, Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said the charges against Stone did not show evidence of any wrongdoing by Trump.
"The president is safe here," he said. He declined to comment immediately on the indictment's description of a senior campaign official being directed to contact Stone.
Prosecutors say that Stone started telling senior Trump officials in June and July 2016 that he had information that WikiLeaks would release documents that would hurt the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
The first public indication of the group's plans came roughly around that time. Assange gave interviews in June in which he claimed that WikiLeaks held material relevant to the White House race.
Then, on July 22, days before the start of the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks published internal Democratic Party emails, upending the convention and forcing the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) as party chairwoman.
According to the indictment, after the July release of DNC emails, a "senior Trump Campaign official was directed" to contact Stone and inquire about what else WikiLeaks had that could damage Clinton's campaign.
That inquiry from the Trump campaign came amid public speculation that Russian operatives were responsible for the hack.
But on the campaign trail, Trump mocked the idea that WikiLeaks was the beneficiary of Russian assistance. As the group released additional stolen material in October, he repeatedly declared his support for WikiLeaks.
Stone's contact with people close to the Trump campaign accelerated in early October 2016.
At the time, Assange was hinting that he was preparing to release more Clinton-related documents. Trump supporters were anxiously waiting for a new WikiLeaks dump that could serve as an October surprise before Election Day.
According to the indictment, Stone wrote on Oct. 3, 2016, to a "supporter involved with the Trump campaign" to assure the person that WikiLeaks' next release was imminent.
"Spoke to my friend in London last night," Stone wrote, in an apparent reference to Assange. "The payload is still coming."
That day, Stone also received an email from a person described in the indictment as "a reporter who had connections to a high ranking Trump Campaign official" who asked what Assange held.
"Hope it's good," the reporter wrote.
An unredacted version of the email previously released shows that the reporter was Matt Boyle, a writer at the conservative website Breitbart who was close to Bannon.
Stone responded: "It is. I'd tell Bannon but he doesn't call me back."
An attorney for Bannon declined to comment on the exchange when Stone posted it last fall in a column on the Daily Caller website, shortly before the New York Times published a story describing the message.
According to the indictment and the full email exchange, Bannon made contact with Stone the next day, after Assange held a news conference in London but failed to release any Democratic materials.
"What was that this morning???" Bannon wrote.
Stone responded that Assange had a security concern, but he promised that WikiLeaks would release "a load every week going forward."
Prosecutors say that Stone also exchanged text messages that day with a "supporter involved with the Trump campaign," who asked whether Stone had heard more from London, another apparent reference to Assange.
Stone responded "yes" and asked to speak on a "secure" line, inquiring whether the supporter could communicate through WhatsApp.
On Oct. 7, WikiLeaks published the first tranche of roughly 55,000 emails stolen from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that it would release in the weeks leading up to Election Day.
An "associate of the high ranking campaign official" sent Stone a text message that day, according to prosecutors. "Well done," it read.

Political discourse at a new low lately

Texto completo: Did you ever get a song lyric stuck in your head?
I have, and here is the one I happen to be hung up on at the moment: "Good authors too who once knew better words / Now only use four-letter words writing / prose..."
That lyric comes from the title song for Cole Porter's 1934 musical "Anything Goes." But I'm not blaming Porter; I blame Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.
In case you've been living under a rock and missed it, Tlaib made headlines a couple weeks ago by presuming to speak for her newly elected members of the House of Representatives. "We're gonna go in there and we're gonna impeach [President Trump]," she vowed.
As my brackets indicate, Tlaib identified Trump by an epithet that doesn't belong in a family newspaper. Suffice it to say it was a vulgar and obscene expression that literally suggests an incestuous union but which has been generalized to mean a loathsome person.
It would, of course, be an overstatement to suggest that politicians "too who once knew better words / now only use four-letter words."
But the fact remains that the level of political discourse has sunk to a new low lately and that Tlaib is hardly responsible for it.
As opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg recently reminded readers of the New York Times, then Vice President Cheney, in 2004, invited "Senator Patrick Leahy, on the Senate floor, to perform an anatomically impossible sexual act with himself. Cheney used the common four-letter F-word to designate said act.
And I personally remember when a hot mic caught then Vice President Biden telling President Obama that the passage of the Affordable Care Act was a "big f***ing deal."
To be clear, I'm not siding with President Trump and other Republicans who reverted to Victorian type in feigning outrage.
Given the kind of language Trump has used in the past, he was hypocritical in suggesting that Tlaib had shamed her family. Were Melania, Ivanka, Jared, Don Jr., Eric, and Barron ashamed when their paterfamilias referred to "s...hole countries," or when he called kneeling NFL players "sons of bitches" and Congressman Adam Schiff "Adam S***"? I rather doubt it. Goldberg suggests that the real obscenity is Trump's racist and misogynist language, and she has a point.
This is not to suggest, however, that I approve of what Tlaib said.
As a former enlisted Marine, I spent my formative years steeped in profanity of the four-letter variety. Prior to that, I lived with a mother who had an inordinate fondness for the four-letter word associated with barnyards and bulls.
I early on decided there were better ways to express myself. And call me an old fogey, but I do believe that those elected to Congress should comport themselves with a certain gravitas and that profanity is a violation of Congressional decorum. Still, I do have to acknowledge a factor in mitigation.
Tlaib is only 42. I'm 72. When I was young, it was unthinkable to use four-letter words — especially those having to do with sex — in mixed company. But along came the cultural revolution of the 1960s, and breaking the old language taboos felt liberating.
For Tlaib and her generation, using the F-word and its variants was probably no big deal. And for the current generation of young people, it's especially commonplace. Sit next to a group of teenagers in a restaurant and eavesdrop on their conversation. You're likely to hear "F***" and "F***ing" used liberally by boys and girls alike.
It's apparent to me, as one who used to preach English, that these words now function like dead metaphors. They no longer call up sexually explicit images in the mind's eye. For my generation, they did, and up until the mid-1960s, most of us subscribed to the fiction that so-called "nice girls" would faint dead away at the sound of an F-bomb. Sexual intimacy was still viewed as a privileged and private matter not to be taken lightly.
Since those bad old days, we've demystified sex, and for the most part, that's a good thing. Still, the word Tlaib used retains some shock value in polite society. Tlaib certainly knows "better words," and she should have used them rather than give Trump supporters another cause célèbre.

The Downside of Anti-Trump Rage

Texto completo: The strategy of "resistance" to President Trump has been a disaster for Democrats. They've denied Mr. Trump the money for a wall on the border with Mexico but lost ground on just about everything else -- notably on taxes, health care and the environment.
By insisting on a blanket refusal to compromise with the president, Democrats played into Republican hands. Fury over Mr. Trump's election got the better of them. All Republicans needed to do -- while in control of Congress and the White House for the past two years -- was stay united. And that's what they did.
Tax reform was a special catastrophe for Democrats. Their losses were more sweeping than either party had imagined possible. In the Senate, Democrats called for a bipartisan tax bill. But they required Republicans not to use "reconciliation" to pass the bill with only 51 votes. The GOP controlled the Senate 52-48 at the time.
The Democrats' proposal wasn't serious. Rejecting it, Republicans took full advantage of the free hand Democrats had foolishly left them. They attacked Democratic sacred cows like the deduction for state and local taxes, which hit wealthy blue states the hardest. It's a deduction President Reagan had tried but failed to kill in the 1980s.
No Republican was more thrilled than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell by the opportunity Democrats had handed the party. "This is much better" than the tax reform measure passed in 1986, he told me. The 2017 version was "much more stimulative because we did not do it on a bipartisan basis. . . . We were kind of able to do it our way."
Republicans were emboldened beyond their wildest dreams. They eliminated the individual mandate in ObamaCare that penalized taxpayers for failing to obtain health insurance. And the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a barren region that Democrats treated like an environmental treasure, was opened for oil and gas drilling.
No one knows how Democrats might have changed the bill. But there's a strong possibility the health-insurance mandate would have survived and ANWR would have remained off-limits. Also, the "carried interest" tax loophole might have been erased and the corporate tax rate set several notches above the 21% enacted by Congress.
What keeps Democrats in the mood for resistance after two years? Mr. Trump has become a fixation. No one arouses their opposition the way he does. Democrats are like those Trump-loathing columnists who can't write about anyone but the president. They're obsessed with Mr. Trump.
The president fuels their mania daily. So does the media. It seemed excessive when Fox News began running his speeches live during the 2016 campaign. But the ratings were great and other networks began showing much more of him, including the speeches. Mr. Trump had seized center stage and never relinquished it. Democrats continue to fume.
Mr. Trump does things to keep the media, and thus Democrats, on his case. He fights back. He counterpunches harder than he's been hit. Speaker Nancy Pelosi should have known she couldn't get away with postponing his State of the Union address. Yet his counterpunch caught her by surprise.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer denounced the president's cancellation of Mrs. Pelosi's military plane to Afghanistan: "It's petty. It's small. It's vindictive." True, but it was also funny. Mr. Trump specializes in making fun of his foes.
Mr. Trump stirs controversy on purpose and for the same reason he fights back and ridicules those he dislikes: He wants attention. At an early campaign event, he claimed John McCain wasn't a hero in Vietnam because he was imprisoned in Hanoi after his plane was shot down. The remark got enormous press play.
Democrats are as appalled by Mr. Trump as ever and remain committed to the resistance. And now they believe they have him in their clutches. They won the House in the midterm elections and intend to drop subpoenas like confetti. They are eager to force Trump officials to testify on Capitol Hill.
In Washington in 2019, hearings are likely to dominate the news. They will cover much of the Trump territory that special counsel Robert Mueller has investigated, plus a whole lot more. But Mr. Mueller does his work in private and House hearings are usually public. This means Democrats are likely to be in attack mode.
Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is eager to investigate how Mr. Trump won the lease to the building in downtown Washington that became the Trump International Hotel. That occurred in 2013, when the president was a private citizen.
Mr. DeFazio wants to know if General Services Administration lawyers failed to consider possible conflicts of interest when the lease was left in the hotel's hands after Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Or if it's a violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause for the hotel to take money from foreign governments.
These are small matters, but the fixation with Mr. Trump extends far. GSA didn't answer Mr. DeFazio's questions last year, and he's still angry. "Now I'm the chairman, and I'm re-submitting those and supplementing those questions," he told Politico. "I look forward to their response, and I have tools if they won't."
With party leaders focused on Mr. Trump, young progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have taken on the task of making the party more left-wing. She "has had the uncommon ability for a first-year member of Congress to push the debate inside the Democratic party to the left," the New York Times reported last week.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's talk of a 70% marginal tax rate on the highest incomes, a "Green New Deal" to replace fossil fuels within 10 years, and abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has attracted media attention and favorable comments from Democratic presidential candidates. Yet these are radical ideas unlikely to help the party win in 2020.
Older Democrats haven't stopped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her progressive allies from becoming a significant force in shaping their party's future. They've been too busy resisting Mr. Trump.

John McAfee's 'in exile' 2020 campaign to include 'road warriors' wearing masks with his face

Texto completo: Libertarian John McAfee is making another run at the presidency in 2020, but this time, he says it will be while he is "in exile" and with the assistance of thousands of "road warriors" dressed up in masks bearing his face.

In a series of tweets and videos posted to Twitter this week, McAfee, the founder of the antivirus software company McAfee Associates, said he is on the run from federal authorities for allegedly using cryptocurrencies in "criminal acts against the U.S. government."

In one video where McAfee had his campaign manager, Rob Loggia, on a wireless speaker, McAfee said that his flock of masked volunteers will make appearances in his stead across the U.S. and that he would talk through them using wireless speakers. Loggia said the idea came from Asian politicians who have tried similar antics.

"Rob [Loggia] and one of our other volunteers are creating masks of my face which are going to be given to thousands of people in two different groups," McAfee said. "First our road warriors who, once a month, are going to appear in parks, street corners, restaurants all around America while I speak through loud speakers through them. Group Two are the people who will be going to conferences doing keynotes. I will be going to conferences as a surrogate. I will be looking at people through a camera, answering questions, shaking hands as I tell my surrogate to shake hands, and speaking. This is how we're going to do it."

McAfee, who first said last year he would run in 2020, has primarily been corresponding with people on Twitter and filming social media videos from his boat that he claims he's using as a hideout from federal prosecution.

McAfee founded computer antivirus company McAfee Associates in 1987 and left in 1994. In the years since, McAfee has bounced around various technology companies and developed a penchant for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While he was once valued at $100 million, the economic recession in 2008 led to his value dropping to $4 million, according to the New York Times.

McAfee's current outlaw status, according to him, is based on his refusal to file tax returns in recent years because he subscribes to the common libertarian theme of a minimalist government. He said he believes cryptocurrencies will eventually prevent the government from collecting income taxes and force the federal government to downsize. He claims that a grand jury was brought together by the Internal Revenue Service to indict him on tax fraud charges but is now on a "freedom boat" that he says will be his home and campaign headquarters for the next two years.

In one of his tweets Tuesday, McAfee said winning the presidency isn't even all that important to him, but he insisted that the platform is what he wants even if he doesn't specify why he wants the spotlight.

This is McAfee's second attempt at the presidency. He sought the Libertarian Party nomination in the 2016 election but lost that spot to Gary Johnson, who finished a distant third to Hillary Clinton and President Trump.

Texto completo: “The ideal journalism school needs only one course. Students should be required to stand outside a closed door for six hours. Then the door would open, someone would put his head around the jamb and say, ‘No comment.’ The door would close again, and the students would be required to write 800 words against a deadline.”
— Russell Baker
The president of Dixie State University, accompanied by a suitably earnest entourage, dropped by for a meeting with The Salt Lake Tribune’s Editorial Board the other week. A courtesy call designed to explain that DSU is and will be a wonderful place. A position that we were quite happy to accept as true.
Until an article appeared in The Tribune outlining how that same university, its student government and its faculty senate are making life difficult for the student-run newspaper, The Dixie Sun News, by closing meetings and denying access to public records. The student editors are fighting back, with the aid of an attorney and, of course, an editorial.
What seemed most striking about the whole mess was that DSU President Richard Williams had just been regaling us, quite properly, with tales of how his university was making a point of building its ever-expanding academic offerings around the real-world needs of both students and employers, equipping graduates with skills they will need to move into the working world.
I’m pretty sure Williams did not say, “Except journalism.” I would have remembered.
Assuming that the president’s macroeconomic crystal ball does not say that training the next generation of journalist would be like offering a master’s degree in making horseshoes, it seemed odd that DSU would be teaching student journalists to sit down and shut up and take the word of their betters for what was and was not public information.
That’s like telling math majors that the value of pi is 7. Or teaching basketball players that they can get away with carrying the ball more than two steps. (Well, wait. If the goal is to excel in the NBA, maybe they should teach that.)
This sort of thing has cropped up before. High school principals and university presidents try to silence the reportorial and opinionating efforts of their own students when those fledgling journalists discover, write or argue something that the grown-ups find embarrassing, distasteful or disruptive. Disruptive, in this case, meaning that it is something that the vice principal couldn’t do when he was in school, so you can’t do it, either.
A recent example was the blatant censorship of the Herriman High School Telegraph when the grown-ups were steamed at the students for doing their job and reporting out the facts behind the sudden and unexplained dismissal of a teacher. Work that should have resulted in a spot on the dean’s list instead was silenced.
Go figure.
But, then, Russell Baker died.
The long-time op-ed columnist for The New York Times, the gold standard writing the for the gold standard, of course received a lengthy obituary in his newspaper. Among the reminiscences was the quote at the top of this essay.
Suddenly, it all made sense.
Dixie State, and all the other educational institutions seen to block and censor their student journalists, aren’t committing educational malpractice. They are posing a real-world scenario for their charges to overcome.
If you are a Star Trek fan, here’s where I just say “Kobayashi Maru,” and you get it. Put the students in a situation that requires them to size up a problem and to figure a way through, over or around it. Or die trying. The students who at least try to overcome the official stonewalling get some attention from the editors who will count the effort as relevant job experience.
Sorry I doubted you.
George Pyle , editorial page editor of The Salt Lake Tribune, is indebted to Russell Baker for teaching him the meaning of some really cool words, like “ eleemosynary .”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is looking at his options.
After being disinvited from giving his State of the Union address in the House chamber, Trump is scouting for a new venue to give the annual address.
While the president had been planning to speak in the House – as is customary – his fight over funding for a border wall and the ongoing partial government shutdown led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revoking his invitation to address the nation on Tuesday.
"I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President’s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened," the California Democrat wrote Wednesday in a letter to Trump.
Pelosi had previously cited possible security concerns because authorities who were in charge of securing the event weren't being paid due to the shutdown and suggested Trump give the address from the Oval Office. The Secret Service is responsible for such events, but the agency, a part of the Department of Homeland Security, is affected by the shutdown.
Here are some other options for where Trump could give his remarks:
Senate floor
While unprecedented in modern times, it could happen.
The Constitution says the president "shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union," but it does not dictate where or when the address should happen.
A handful of House Republicans, led by Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, have urged Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , to invite Trump to deliver the address from the Senate.
“In the spirit of the Constitution, and for the good of the Republic, we must not allow partisan politics to disrupt time honored Constitutional traditions,” they wrote in a letter.
Their letter, sent last week, also said House Democrats should be at the bottom of the priority for getting seats in the smaller Senate chambers, if Trump does choose that venue.
It's unclear if Trump is seriously considering this as an option. If he is, space is likely to be tight as the Senate has 100 desks on the floor and the House has more than 400 seats at the ready. Banks had not received a response to the letter as of Wednesday.
At the start of the Republic in the late 1700s, presidents offered annual messages on the Senate floor but that was before the messages became known as the State of the Union and before the U. S. Capitol was moved to Washington.
It's become customary for the address to happen in the House chambers in either January or February.
Presidents have given speeches to the Senate nine times in the past but none were considered State of the Union addresses, according to the U. S. Senate Historical Office.
White House
The White House itself is another option.
The president earlier this month gave an address to the nation from the Oval Office about the ongoing government shutdown and immigration. He could give his State of the Union address in a similar fashion.
"We always like to have a Plan B, but the president should be able to address the American people," White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox, "whether he does that from the halls of Congress or whether he does that in another location. "
Invitations from other states
Republican lawmakers in several states have even offered up the state Capitol as the venue for the president's address.
Rep. Lee Chatfield, a state lawmaker in Michigan, sent a letter to the White House offering to hold the event at the Michigan State Capitol.
"There is no higher loyalty or obligation than to the people we serve and the communities we represent, and no partisan gamesmanship should stand in the way of that service," Chatfield said in the letter. "Because of that, this chamber and this speaker are willing to put people before policies for this important occasion. "
Trump called to thank him for the support and decline the offer, Chatfield wrote on Twitter.
Similar offers have been made in North Carolina and West Virginia.
In North Carolina, state lawmaker Tim Moore invited the president to give his address at the State Capitol, and in West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice also extended an invite.
It doesn't appear that the president was interested in holding the address in either state.
A campaign-style rally
The State of the Union has a certain sense of prestige.
It helps guide the country through the president's forthcoming agenda and highlights his accomplishments over the last year. It's held in the U. S. Capitol and hosts members of Congress, both the House and Senate, the president's cabinet and all nine Supreme Court justices.
But, the president could elect to hold a rally, some speculating at the border, in lieu of an official address to Congress.
Several media outlets, including the New York Times and ABC News, have reported that a campaign-style rally is still on the table as an option.
ABC News reported that Trump had drafted up two different versions of his speech, including rally styled remarks that cater to his supporters.
Of course, the possibilities are endless. For now, Trump appears to still anticipate giving his address on Tuesday so we'll know soon enough where the event will be held.

A common smartphone feature helped find missing woman

Texto completo: Technology played a major part in helping Boston police track down Olivia Ambrose. It wasn't some exotic computer program lurking inside a CSI-type laboratory, but a commonplace feature many consumers have learned to master on their own smartphones — location tracking.
Unable to reach her after a Saturday night visit to a Boston bar, Ambrose's sister used a common iPhone feature that lets people find the location of their friends or family members. The app told her sister that the last known location of Ambrose's phone, and perhaps Ambrose herself, was near the intersection of Corey Road and Walford Way in Charlestown, according to the police report filed in the arrest of Victor Pena.
By itself, this clue wasn't enough to locate Ambrose, and it would be another two days before police were able to enter Pena's apartment Tuesday afternoon and free Ambrose. In the intervening time, Pena allegedly had seized Ambrose's phone, preventing her from contacting anyone and keeping the phone itself from relaying additional information about her whereabouts.
But the sister's detective work did help police to narrow down the search area, and they used a combination of technology and shoe leather to zero in on Pena's apartment on Walford Way at the intersection with Corey Road — just where the iPhone app initially located Ambrose. (At one point in its report, Boston police identified the app as Find my Friends, and at another as the Find my iPhone app.)
Security camera footage captured Ambrose leaving an MBTA station with an unidentified male. Police canvassed the Charlestown neighborhood, and two occupants of the Bunker Hill housing complex pointed them to Pena's apartment.
The episode is a reminder that location tracking was first added to mobile phones to help people in peril. In the early days of cellphones, calls to the 911 emergency system did not identify addresses as landline phones did.
So in 1996, the Federal Communications Commission ordered wireless phone companies to install systems that located cellphones making a 911 call. First, phone makers used the triangulation of radio signals from cell towers. Then came built-in GPS chips for greater accuracy. Phones can even calculate location using the signals of nearby Wi-Fi routers.
Beyond helping people in need, the new technology proved a boon to phone makers, carriers, and other businesses. By the mid-2000s, phones had navigation apps with turn-by-turn driving instructions. The makers of smartphone software — Apple for the iPhone and Google for Android — began scooping up our location data, for use in selling advertisements or providing local news and weather reports. Even the apps we install routinely track our whereabouts.
This nonstop monitoring has sometimes been put to questionable use. Earlier this month, the online tech news site Motherboard reported that wireless carriers T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T have been selling access to their customers' location data, and that some of it was being purchased by car salesmen, bail bondsmen, and bounty hunters. And The New York Times reported last year that some apps track a phone's location as frequently as 14,000 times per day, even when the app isn't being used.
“A lot of us look at it through the lens of privacy and say, that's terrible," said David Choffnes, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University. “But of course there are cases where it can be very helpful."

A stew recipe you’ll enjoy making as much as you’ll love eating -BYLN- By Don Mauer Daily Herald correspondent

Texto completo: The introduction to a unique New York Times’ beef stew recipe began: "Make it when you have the time to indulge in the meditative qualities of chopping, sautÃ©ing, reducing, braising, waiting and tasting. You will be rewarded with an exceptionally flavorful dish that is just as satisfying to eat as it was to cook." Okay, those words hooked me. It’s the end of January, and I’m tired of cold weather and, lucky me, have the time on a Saturday or Sunday to hang in my warm kitchen and make some it-takes-time food. For this, there are no special tools required; just a Dutch oven or large pot, a skillet a few bowls, and a range.
Instead of stew meat I had 3 pounds of beef short ribs ($9 per pound) that I’d purchased directly from the cattle farm on which that cattle had been raised and was delivered to me at a meet-up point, by the farmer, so that I knew, for sure, it was grass-fed and grass-finished.
Why was that such a big deal for me? Glad you asked.
For me, pigs, poultry and cattle should be raised as they have always been raised until they reach maturity: on a farm in a natural setting; not confined in crates or sent to feedlots. That also means that chickens aren’t fed GMO (genetically modified organisms) corn, and cattle and pigs aren’t fed GMO soybean meal.
I headed to my kitchen and lined up all the ingredients for this meal (and there are quite a few). Recipe substitutions to the stew recipe were needed, however.
That New York Times recipe required two things I did not have: Cognac and Pommery mustard. Cognac is fancy brandy specifically from the Cognac region of France. It’s great stuff; but pricey. Mustard Pommery is expensive (about $17 to $20), whole-grain (you can see the seeds) mustard from, once again, France. Its unique flavor profile is, in one word, incredible.
Those issues did not keep me from making the recipe.
Without Cognac in my liquor cabinet I decided to go with whiskey (Makers Mark); not equal to Cognac, but serviceable. Lucky me, I had a jar of Maille brand Classic Dijon Old Style Mustard in the fridge. You can see the whole mustard seeds in the bottle.
When I first read the 5-step recipe, it didn’t seem to be that big a deal. It turns out, I should have paid attention to the: "chopping, sautÃ©ing, reducing, braising, waiting and tasting" part of the quote.
The recipe didn’t require organic carrots or mushrooms, but I used them anyhow. Once everything was simmering away my kitchen filled with a fantastic aroma. My partner, Nan, came home took in a deep breath and said, "What are you making, it smells intoxicating."
The original stew recipe called for simmering for 90 minutes; my short ribs took 2 hours before I could add the carrots and finally the mushrooms and red wine.
When I first tasted the broth with all that mustard (a half cup is not an error) it had a sharp edge to it. However, by the time we sat down for dinner, the flavor had mellowed and evolved and was as good as I’d hoped; perhaps, better. Got a lazy, cold-outside afternoon with some available beef short ribs in your fridge? Give this a try. * Don Mauer welcomes questions, comments and recipe makeover requests.

Immigration has had large impact on Latin America

Texto completo: Recently I have been reminded that there are many strong ethnic communities in Latin America. With so much attention in the media to immigrants in the U.S. from Latin America, the U.S. public should realize that Latin Americans are far from the "cookie cutter" image that prevails today.
In April when Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez was sworn in as president of Cuba to end 60 years of rule by the Castro brothers, media reports commented that this historic change would herald more diversity in the Cuban government, namely more positions for women and Afro-Cubans. For instance, a New York Times headline read, "A Transition of Power in Cuba Sends a Signal on Diversity, Too." What does not receive media coverage in the U.S. is the diversity in Latin American countries, which in Cuba and elsewhere go far beyond the cited diversity in the new Cuban government.
Few people realize the extent of Asian immigration into Latin America. While today most big cities in the region have a Chinatown, Cuba used to have the largest Chinese population in Latin America before Fidel Castro took power. Beginning in 1847, Chinese immigrations came to Cuba to work the sugar plantations and this Chinese immigration continued until the 1940s. In 1940, the Chinatown in Havana alone was said to have 40,000 people. Cubans of Chinese descent were prominent on both sides of the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s. In fact, a 2006 book "Our Story Is Still Being Written: The Story of Three Chinese-Cuban Generals in the Cuban Revolution" chronicles the stories of Armando Choy, Gustavo Chiy and Moises Sio Wong, three high-profile generals who helped Fidel Castro gain power and later were prominent in the Cuban military and government for some time.
An overlooked and compelling fact is that Brazil holds the distinction of having the highest ethnic Japanese population outside of Japan as in 2008 it was determined that there were more than 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants in Brazil, primarily in the state of Sao Paolo.
To a lesser degree, Peru and Paraguay have noticeable Japanese communities as first-generation Japanese-Peruvian Alberto Fujimori served as president of Peru from 1990-2000, all the time while political opponents alleged that he was ineligible to be president, claiming Fujimori was really born in Japa. By far, Argentina has the largest Korean community in Latin American which was estimated at 40,000 in 1990, but has been cut in half in recent years as Argentine economic hardship has forced many Korean-Argentines to leave for the U.S.
Over 60% of the Uruguayan population is of Italian descent, with Italian immigration to the South American nation beginning in the 1870's and continuing until the 1960's. An irony occurred in the 2014 World Cup when Italy was knocked out early by Uruguay. However, the biggest World Cup irony, which was noted in the media, was that in the final round Germany met Argentina, a nation that is famous for its large German population.
Another ethnic group in Argentina that is little known to the outside world is that of the Irish. Large numbers of Irish came to Argentina between 1870 and 1930, giving Argentina the largest Irish population outside of the English-speaking world.
There are also visible Lebanese communities in numerous countries and a multitude of strong Jewish communities throughout the region. With immigration from Latin America being such a major issue in recent years, the U.S. public needs to be aware that the image of the typical Latino should not be of the cookie cutter mold. While Latino immigrants obviously bring diversity to the U.S., people in the U.S. should be aware that there is great diversity within Latino countries and that these ethnic communities only make those countries most interesting places.

Texto completo: OBITUARY
Russell Baker, Writer
and Humorist, Dies
Russell Baker, the genial but sharp-witted writer who won Pulitzer Prizes for his humorous columns in the New York Times and a moving autobiography of his impoverished Baltimore childhood and later hosted television's "Masterpiece Theatre," has died. He was 93.
Allen Baker told the Associated Press his father died Monday from complications after a fall. In his later years, Mr. Baker lived in Leesburg, Va., not far from the rural community of his native Morrisonville.
Amiable and approachable, but also clear-eyed and street smart, Mr. Baker enjoyed a decadeslong career as reporter, columnist, critic and on-air personality. He won Pulitzers in 1979 for the "Observer," the Times column he wrote for 35 years, and in 1983 for his autobiography "Growing Up."
He wrote a second autobiography, "The Good Times," to follow "Growing Up." The first focused on his childhood, the second on his early journalistic career. Mr. Baker would eventually write, edit or contribute to more than 15 other books, collections and assorted works-- including a musical play and children's book.
Mr. Baker took over as "Masterpiece Theatre's" host in 1993, succeeding Alistair Cooke, and remained until 2004

Kamala Harris Raises
$1.5 Million Online
Sen. Kamala Harris raised $1.5 million from 38,000 donors online in the 24 hours after announcing her presidential run Monday morning, her campaign said.
The California Democrat saw a burst of $1 million in contributions in the first 12 hours after her appearance on ABC's "Good Morning America" and the simultaneous release of an online video, her campaign said, adding that the average donation was about $37.
Democrats have put a premium on grass-roots fundraising ahead of the 2020 campaign.

SOUTH CAROLINA
Confederate Flag Put
On View at Museum
The last Confederate flag to fly at the South Carolina Statehouse has quietly been put on display at a museum, ending a three-year saga over what to do with the rebel banner, which was removed after nine black church members were killed in a racist attack on a Charleston church.
On Nov. 26, Confederate Relic Room staff put the nylon flag into a viewing case that hangs between two offices amid a display of other historical South Carolina flags, museum Executive Director Allen Roberson told lawmakers on Tuesday.

Four Charged in Plot
On Muslim Enclave
Three men and a high-school student were charged with plotting to attack a rural upstate New York Muslim community named Islamberg with explosives, authorities said Tuesday.
The Rochester-area residents are accused of plotting to attack the small Muslim enclave west of the Catskills.
At the time of their weekend arrests, the men had access to 23 rifles and shotguns and three homemade explosives, Greece, N.Y., police said.
It was unclear whether the suspects had lawyers yet.

Texto completo: The strategy of "resistance" to President Trump has been a disaster for Democrats. They've denied Mr. Trump the money for a wall on the border with Mexico but lost ground on just about everything else -- notably on taxes, health care and the environment.
By insisting on a blanket refusal to compromise with the president, Democrats played into Republican hands. Fury over Mr. Trump's election got the better of them. All Republicans needed to do -- while in control of Congress and the White House for the past two years -- was stay united. And that's what they did.
Tax reform was a special catastrophe for Democrats. Their losses were more sweeping than either party had imagined possible. In the Senate, Democrats called for a bipartisan tax bill. But they required Republicans not to use "reconciliation" to pass the bill with only 51 votes. The GOP controlled the Senate 52-48 at the time.
The Democrats' proposal wasn't serious. Rejecting it, Republicans took full advantage of the free hand Democrats had foolishly left them. They attacked Democratic sacred cows like the deduction for state and local taxes, which hit wealthy blue states the hardest. It's a deduction President Reagan had tried but failed to kill in the 1980s.
No Republican was more thrilled than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell by the opportunity Democrats had handed the party. "This is much better" than the tax reform measure passed in 1986, he told me. The 2017 version was "much more stimulative because we did not do it on a bipartisan basis. . . . We were kind of able to do it our way."
Republicans were emboldened beyond their wildest dreams. They eliminated the individual mandate in ObamaCare that penalized taxpayers for failing to obtain health insurance. And the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a barren region that Democrats treated like an environmental treasure, was opened for oil and gas drilling.
No one knows how Democrats might have changed the bill. But there's a strong possibility the health-insurance mandate would have survived and ANWR would have remained off-limits. Also, the "carried interest" tax loophole might have been erased and the corporate tax rate set several notches above the 21% enacted by Congress.
What keeps Democrats in the mood for resistance after two years? Mr. Trump has become a fixation. No one arouses their opposition the way he does. Democrats are like those Trump-loathing columnists who can't write about anyone but the president. They're obsessed with Mr. Trump.
The president fuels their mania daily. So does the media. It seemed excessive when Fox News began running his speeches live during the 2016 campaign. But the ratings were great and other networks began showing much more of him, including the speeches. Mr. Trump had seized center stage and never relinquished it. Democrats continue to fume.
Mr. Trump does things to keep the media, and thus Democrats, on his case. He fights back. He counterpunches harder than he's been hit. Speaker Nancy Pelosi should have known she couldn't get away with postponing his State of the Union address. Yet his counterpunch caught her by surprise.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer denounced the president's cancellation of Mrs. Pelosi's military plane to Afghanistan: "It's petty. It's small. It's vindictive." True, but it was also funny. Mr. Trump specializes in making fun of his foes.
Mr. Trump stirs controversy on purpose and for the same reason he fights back and ridicules those he dislikes: He wants attention. At an early campaign event, he claimed John McCain wasn't a hero in Vietnam because he was imprisoned in Hanoi after his plane was shot down. The remark got enormous press play.
Democrats are as appalled by Mr. Trump as ever and remain committed to the resistance. And now they believe they have him in their clutches. They won the House in the midterm elections and intend to drop subpoenas like confetti. They are eager to force Trump officials to testify on Capitol Hill.
In Washington in 2019, hearings are likely to dominate the news. They will cover much of the Trump territory that special counsel Robert Mueller has investigated, plus a whole lot more. But Mr. Mueller does his work in private and House hearings are usually public. This means Democrats are likely to be in attack mode.
Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is eager to investigate how Mr. Trump won the lease to the building in downtown Washington that became the Trump International Hotel. That occurred in 2013, when the president was a private citizen.
Mr. DeFazio wants to know if General Services Administration lawyers failed to consider possible conflicts of interest when the lease was left in the hotel's hands after Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Or if it's a violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause for the hotel to take money from foreign governments.
These are small matters, but the fixation with Mr. Trump extends far. GSA didn't answer Mr. DeFazio's questions last year, and he's still angry. "Now I'm the chairman, and I'm re-submitting those and supplementing those questions," he told Politico. "I look forward to their response, and I have tools if they won't."
With party leaders focused on Mr. Trump, young progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have taken on the task of making the party more left-wing. She "has had the uncommon ability for a first-year member of Congress to push the debate inside the Democratic party to the left," the New York Times reported last week.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's talk of a 70% marginal tax rate on the highest incomes, a "Green New Deal" to replace fossil fuels within 10 years, and abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has attracted media attention and favorable comments from Democratic presidential candidates. Yet these are radical ideas unlikely to help the party win in 2020.
Older Democrats haven't stopped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her progressive allies from becoming a significant force in shaping their party's future. They've been too busy resisting Mr. Trump.

Texto completo: Regarding Steve H. Hanke and Stephen J.K. Walters's op-ed "Lying Prices Keeping America Hooked on Spending" (Jan. 8): Repeated efforts to control the national debt have failed because those in Washington have defaulted on their responsibility to lead. A previous attempt entitled "National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform," created in 2010 by President Obama and chaired by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, was championed as a bipartisan presidential commission on deficit reduction. The Bowles-Simpson report never officially came to a vote because both parties in Washington ignored the national interest in favor of special interests.
There is no better time then now for America's leaders to stop the mud fights and responsibly do their part to fix this ever-increasing debt problem. We cannot be great if we go broke.

In their well-crafted call for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, Profs. Hanke and Walters imply that, while the measure almost succeeded in Congress in 1982, it hasn't had similar success since. In fact, a similar measure flew through the House in 1995 with 300 bipartisan votes in favor and then narrowly failed in the Senate. A March 3, 1995, New York Times article says: "The actual vote was 65 to 35, with Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, casting a vote against the amendment, but only as a parliamentary dodge. By aligning himself with the winning side, he won the right under Senate rules to bring the amendment back to the floor later, something he has pledged to do."
There was another near win in 1997, and since then the House has passed balanced-budget amendments several times. When millennials realize they won't receive the benefits enjoyed by today's elderly, they might decide that they're not going to pay for them.

China Tiptoes on Belt and Road

Texto completo: DAVOS, Switzerland -- Ever since President Xi Jinping of China unveiled the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 to link the economies of Asia, Europe and Africa with highways, rail lines and power plants, Beijing has promoted the program as a centerpiece of its foreign policy.
But China has turned down the volume on its plan, even though it still appears to be moving forward. Spending on the initiative also fell somewhat last year, as the broader Chinese economy slowed.
Various senior Chinese government officials are at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, including Vice President Wang Qishan, who is to speak on Wednesday. None of them, though, participated in a panel during one of the forum's most prominent time slots Tuesday that was focused on the Belt and Road Initiative and billed as a review of "China's trillion-dollar vision."
Instead, the vice chairman of a government-linked trade association and the chairman of a state-owned business spoke cautiously about the initiative.
Except for a long-scheduled meeting with African leaders in Beijing in September, top Chinese officials have said fairly little about the Belt and Road program since last summer. The initiative has been plagued by allegations of corruption, overspending on vanity projects, excessive debt and other problems in countries like Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Uganda.
The panel on Tuesday seemed like an opportunity to recast the initiative's image to a crowd stacked with government leaders and tycoons from developing countries, many of which have borrowed heavily from Chinese financial institutions to build infrastructure as part of the program.
But China took a different tack. Xu Niansha, the chairman of the state-owned China Poly Group, apologized for not having many statistics about the program, a rare occurrence given that Chinese corporate or government officials often lard their speeches and discussions with numbers.
Speaking in general terms, Mr. Xu said China's rapid economic growth in recent decades had put it in a better position than many countries to foster economic development elsewhere. "We do know what people need," he said. "That is why I think we can do a better job in cooperation."
The most recently available data from China's commerce ministry shows that the value of newly signed contracts under the Belt and Road Initiative fell 20.4 percent in the first 11 months of last year compared with the same period in 2017. Almost all of these contracts are financed by state-owned Chinese financial institutions.
(Frank Ning, the chairman of the Chinese chemical giant Sinochem, said during a different panel that there was a new awareness in China about worries outside the country over how its businesses make overseas investments. "I think the Chinese are quite confused, they thought they would be welcome in other countries," he said.)
The Belt and Road discussion was moderated by Tian Wei, a well-known anchor for the state-run China Global Television Network, making the absence of Chinese government officials, who typically shun panels with foreign moderators known to have criticized China, somewhat surprising.
Ms. Tian repeatedly hinted at the resentment felt by some people in China about foreign criticisms of the Belt and Road program, which she said was helping to build roads in developing countries that need them. "Let's talk about facts, let's talk about case studies, and let's talk about the real stories, not just hearsay," she added.
Wang Yongqing, the vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, mentioned during the panel that China had helped build an industrial park in Ethiopia that makes leather products. But he and Mr. Xu avoided specifics about the hundreds of Belt and Road infrastructure projects already completed or underway. Critics say Chinese construction companies have moved so quickly partly because they bring in thousands of Chinese workers instead of training locals, and because they arrange special deals with local officials in developing countries that allow them to avoid paying tariffs on machinery that they ship in.
Sitting in the audience was Xiao Yaqing, the government minister who oversees state-owned enterprises. Asked to speak by Ms. Tian, he suggested one possible reason for Chinese officials' caution when he said the Belt and Road push was good for Chinese companies as well as for other countries.
There have sometimes been criticisms on Chinese social media, quickly deleted by censors, that Beijing was spending money on overseas development that would be better spent at home, particularly when economic growth is slowing in the country.
China has been rethinking two aspects of the initiative: how it decides on overseas spending, and how the initiative is presented to overseas audiences. In September, Mr. Xi promised a further $60 billion for projects in African countries, but he made a point of saying that China would not pay for what he called vanity projects.
Nobody thinks Belt and Road is fading away. Mr. Wang, the trade association vice chairman, said China would invite entrepreneurs to events next fall that emphasized business opportunities through the initiative.
Among business leaders from countries like India that have been skeptical of the initiative, there are continuing worries that it will keep moving ahead, and leave them behind.
"Indian business leaders are concerned that China is building linkages around the world," Gaurav Dalmia, the chairman of the Indian conglomerate Dalmia Group, said in an interview before the panel talk. "Indian companies may get left out on the resource side."

Texto completo: The strategy of "resistance" to President Trump has been a disaster for Democrats. They've denied Mr. Trump the money for a wall on the border with Mexico but lost ground on just about everything else--notably on taxes, health care and the environment.
By insisting on a blanket refusal to compromise with the president, Democrats played into Republican hands. Fury over Mr. Trump's election got the better of them. All Republicans needed to do--while in control of Congress and the White House for the past two years--was stay united. And that's what they did.
Tax reform was a special catastrophe for Democrats. Their losses were more sweeping than either party had imagined possible. In the Senate, Democrats called for a bipartisan tax bill. But they required Republicans not to use "reconciliation" to pass the bill with only 51 votes. The GOP controlled the Senate 52-48 at the time.
The Democrats' proposal wasn't serious. Rejecting it, Republicans took full advantage of the free hand Democrats had foolishly left them. They attacked Democratic sacred cows like the deduction for state and local taxes, which hit wealthy blue states the hardest. It's a deduction President Reagan had tried but failed to kill in the 1980s.
No Republican was more thrilled than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell by the opportunity Democrats had handed the party. "This is much better" than the tax reform measure passed in 1986, he told me. The 2017 version was "much more stimulative because we did not do it on a bipartisan basis. . . . We were kind of able to do it our way."
Republicans were emboldened beyond their wildest dreams. They eliminated the individual mandate in ObamaCare that penalized taxpayers for failing to obtain health insurance. And the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a barren region that Democrats treated like an environmental treasure, was opened for oil and gas drilling.
No one knows how Democrats might have changed the bill. But there's a strong possibility the health-insurance mandate would have survived and ANWR would have remained off-limits. Also, the "carried interest" tax loophole might have been erased and the corporate tax rate set several notches above the 21% enacted by Congress.
What keeps Democrats in the mood for resistance after two years? Mr. Trump has become a fixation. No one arouses their opposition the way he does. Democrats are like those Trump-loathing columnists who can't write about anyone but the president. They're obsessed with Mr. Trump.
The president fuels their mania daily. So does the media. It seemed excessive when Fox News began running his speeches live during the 2016 campaign. But the ratings were great and other networks began showing much more of him, including the speeches. Mr. Trump had seized center stage and never relinquished it. Democrats continue to fume.
Mr. Trump does things to keep the media, and thus Democrats, on his case. He fights back. He counterpunches harder than he's been hit. Speaker Nancy Pelosi should have known she couldn't get away with postponing his State of the Union address. Yet his counterpunch caught her by surprise.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer denounced the president's cancellation of Mrs. Pelosi's military plane to Afghanistan: "It's petty. It's small. It's vindictive." True, but it was also funny. Mr. Trump specializes in making fun of his foes.
Mr. Trump stirs controversy on purpose and for the same reason he fights back and ridicules those he dislikes: He wants attention. At an early campaign event, he claimed John McCain wasn't a hero in Vietnam because he was imprisoned in Hanoi after his plane was shot down. The remark got enormous press play.
Democrats are as appalled by Mr. Trump as ever and remain committed to the resistance. And now they believe they have him in their clutches. They won the House in the midterm elections and intend to drop subpoenas like confetti. They are eager to force Trump officials to testify on Capitol Hill.
In Washington in 2019, hearings are likely to dominate the news. They will cover much of the Trump territory that special counsel Robert Mueller has investigated, plus a whole lot more. But Mr. Mueller does his work in private and House hearings are usually public. This means Democrats are likely to be in attack mode.
Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is eager to investigate how Mr. Trump won the lease to the building in downtown Washington that became the Trump International Hotel. That occurred in 2013, when the president was a private citizen.
Mr. DeFazio wants to know if General Services Administration lawyers failed to consider possible conflicts of interest when the lease was left in the hotel's hands after Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Or if it's a violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause for the hotel to take money from foreign governments.
These are small matters, but the fixation with Mr. Trump extends far. GSA didn't answer Mr. DeFazio's questions last year, and he's still angry. "Now I'm the chairman, and I'm re-submitting those and supplementing those questions," he told Politico. "I look forward to their response, and I have tools if they won't."
With party leaders focused on Mr. Trump, young progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have taken on the task of making the party more left-wing. She "has had the uncommon ability for a first-year member of Congress to push the debate inside the Democratic party to the left," the New York Times reported last week.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's talk of a 70% marginal tax rate on the highest incomes, a "Green New Deal" to replace fossil fuels within 10 years, and abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has attracted media attention and favorable comments from Democratic presidential candidates. Yet these are radical ideas unlikely to help the party win in 2020.
Older Democrats haven't stopped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her progressive allies from becoming a significant force in shaping their party's future. They've been too busy resisting Mr. Trump.

Texto completo: Regarding Steve H. Hanke and Stephen J.K. Walters's op-ed "Lying Prices Keeping America Hooked on Spending " (Jan. 8): Repeated efforts to control the national debt have failed because those in Washington have defaulted on their responsibility to lead. A previous attempt entitled "National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform," created in 2010 by President Obama and chaired by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, was championed as a bipartisan presidential commission on deficit reduction. The Bowles-Simpson report never officially came to a vote because both parties in Washington ignored the national interest in favor of special interests.
There is no better time then now for America's leaders to stop the mud fights and responsibly do their part to fix this ever-increasing debt problem. We cannot be great if we go broke.
James W. Crowley Jr.
Fort Myers, Fla.
In their well-crafted call for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, Profs. Hanke and Walters imply that, while the measure almost succeeded in Congress in 1982, it hasn't had similar success since. In fact, a similar measure flew through the House in 1995 with 300 bipartisan votes in favor and then narrowly failed in the Senate. A March 3, 1995, New York Times article says: "The actual vote was 65 to 35, with Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, casting a vote against the amendment, but only as a parliamentary dodge. By aligning himself with the winning side, he won the right under Senate rules to bring the amendment back to the floor later, something he has pledged to do."
There was another near win in 1997, and since then the House has passed balanced-budget amendments several times. When millennials realize they won't receive the benefits enjoyed by today's elderly, they might decide that they're not going to pay for them.

Teachers Unions Don't Really Strike for 'the Kids'; When the United Auto Workers walk off the job, no one pretends they care about car buyers.

Texto completo: When the United Auto Workers walk off the job, no one pretends that they are acting in the interests of car buyers. Everyone knows union members want better wages, benefits, working conditions and job protections, and going on strike is an effective way to exert pressure on employers.
The calculation is no different when teachers strike. Unions like the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers and their thousands of state and local affiliates exist for the same reason as the UAW: to advance the interests of dues-paying members. Yet striking public school teachers and their union representatives insist they are acting on behalf of the children. We're expected to believe that the priorities of education workers are perfectly aligned with those of students.
The Los Angeles teachers strike ended Tuesday after six days, and casual observers could be forgiven for thinking that the walkout was all about the kids. Union picketers carried signs that read, "On Strike for Our Students" and "Fund Our Schools / Give L.A. Students the schools they deserve." A high-school teacher wrote in the Journal last week that he was striking for the sake of his charges: "As a teacher, my loyalty is to my students. We're fighting this battle for them, and they will be the victors." In a paid advertisement in Sunday's New York Times, AFT President Randi Weingarten used similar language. "Everything teachers are demanding would strengthen public schools," she wrote. The strike is about "ensuring that all public schools have the conditions they need for student success." Yeah, right.
Before the Los Angeles strike began, local officials took steps to keep schools open by hiring substitute instructors and aides. The striking teachers did everything they could to sabotage those efforts, like taking textbooks and supplies home to ensure that they weren't used during the strike. That's an odd way of looking out for the interests of your students.
Ms. Weingarten's reference to "all public schools" is misleading. She really means all public schools that employ union members. Public charter schools, which are mostly nonunionized and growing rapidly in the city, don't count in her estimation. Charters now enroll about 20% of public school students in Los Angeles, up from 12% seven years ago, and curbing the expansion of schools that don't employ their members has long been a major priority of teachers unions. The Los Angeles Times reports that only 42% of the district's students can read at grade level, and math proficiency is an even lower 32%. Families are fleeing union-run schools, so labor leaders are trying to block the exits. Whether students benefit from more school choice is not something that concerns teachers unions. They care whether their members benefit.
Los Angeles teachers were following a path blazed last year by educators who demonstrated in places like Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia, Colorado and Washington state. They demanded bigger budgets, higher salaries, smaller class sizes and less standardized testing. Put another way, they want more pay for less work and accountability. Gee, who doesn't?
For teachers, reducing the size of each class means fewer children to mind and assignments to grade. For unions, it means more jobs for dues-paying teachers and ultimately more money in AFT and NEA coffers to spend lobbying politicians and policy makers to keep schools organized in a way that benefits their members first and foremost.
The union has won some concessions on pay and class size, but whether the deal will improve test scores, graduation rates or college readiness is an afterthought for labor leaders. And we have every reason to believe it won't. The U.S. spends more than twice as much on education--per student and after inflation--as it did in 1970 and more than three times as much as in 1960. School expenditures in high-poverty districts are typically well above the national average.
Yet standardized test results show little improvement, and large racial gaps persist. We've long known that class size matters much less than teacher quality. Charter schools with larger classes have outperformed traditional public schools with smaller classes. And in countries such as Japan and South Korea, which regularly outperform the U.S. on international tests, average class sizes are larger than here.
Teachers unions are unions first, not reformers or student advocates. Their real agenda--their only agenda--is to protect their members by any means possible. No matter what those picket signs said, the unions weren't helping students. They were using them.

Private-Equity Executives to Get Rusal Holding Company Votes in Sanctions Deal; The company is working to implement a deal with the U.S. that lifts sanctions

Texto completo: Two private-equity executives were among the three people chosen to exercise voting rights on certain shares of EN+ Group PLC that will be relinquished as part of a deal to remove U.S. sanctions on the company.
David Knower of Cerberus Capital Management and David Crane of Pegasus Capital Advisors will exercise voting rights on shares transferred from Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire close to the Kremlin, the company said Friday in a statement. The third man, D.J. Baker, is a retired partner at Latham & Watkins LLP who had been global co-chair of the law firm's corporate restructuring practice.
They were named as EN+ works to adhere to the terms of a deal struck in December with the U.S. Treasury Department. The deal would remove sanctions on EN+ and two companies it controls, aluminum giant United Co. Rusal and energy firm JSC EuroSibEnergo.
The companies weren't accused of conduct that would have led to sanctions, but any property majority-owned by someone under U.S. sanctions is blocked under a policy known as the "50% rule."
Mr. Deripaska held a 70% stake in EN+; the deal reduces his ownership to 44.95% and it cuts his voting share to 35%. He was put under sanctions in April as part of a larger package targeting Russian meddling in U.S. elections, cyberattacks and other conduct, the U.S. said.
EN+ also is required to replace its board with members approved by the U.S. Treasury and to allow the U.S. to see internal company documents, including earnings reports and board minutes.
The broad contours of the agreement were laid out in a letter to Congress.
The sanctions on the companies were never fully implemented, as the U.S. issued licenses allowing certain business activity as the two sides tried to work out a deal. The companies have U.S. authorizations until Jan. 28 to work out the technical aspects of implementing the deal.
As of Tuesday, the companies were still on the U.S. blacklist. They didn't respond to emails seeking comment. A Treasury Department spokesman didn't reply to requests for comment.
The deal to remove them from the U.S. sanctions list has become politicized in recent weeks due to concerns, mostly among Democrats who were joined by several Republicans, that the Trump administration was going easy on Moscow. A Democratic-led effort in Congress to block the sanctions failed in the Senate despite the approval from nearly a dozen Republicans.
Reports emerged in recent days that highlighted the lobbying efforts used by the companies to reach the deal and raised questions about whether Mr. Deripaska would benefit from the removals of the firms, despite claims from the Treasury that he wouldn't.
The New York Times, citing the confidential text of the deal, reported Monday that the agreement effectively relieves Mr. Deripaska of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and leaves him, through allies such as members of his family, still holding majority ownership of EN+.
The department defended the deal in a statement to the Times. The Wall Street Journal couldn't immediately verify or review the document.
Lawyers, analysts and sanctions policy observers, who had largely endorsed the agreement when struck, said the latest reporting highlights the complexities of removing high-profile targets from the blacklist.
"Winding down a designation based on the 50% rule is very hard to manage, especially if the underlying target who remains sanctioned has numerous vectors of ownership...that can allow the continuation of de facto interest," said Adam M. Smith, a partner at the firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP.

The Women's March Follows Farrakhan off a Cliff

Texto completo: Saturday's Women's March was much smaller than the original, held in 2017. It was notable not only because far fewer showed up but for who stayed away. The Democratic Party disavowed its partnership with the march, as did the Southern Poverty Law Center, Emily's List, the Human Rights Campaign, NARAL, the Center for American Progress and hundreds of other liberal interest groups. The march had 550 official partners in 2018 and less than half as many this year. One by one, the pink hats came off.
What happened? The group that yelled loudest about Mr. Trump's bigotry was brought low by bigotry of its own. Tablet reported last month that at the first meeting to organize the Women's March, four days after Mr. Trump's election, two of the group's leaders, Carmen Perez and Tamika Mallory, insisted that, in the reporters' paraphrase, "Jewish people bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people" and were leaders of the slave trade. Vanessa Wruble, a key organizer who is Jewish, told reporters Ms. Perez and Ms. Mallory later berated her: "You people hold all the wealth." Ms. Wruble was pushed out of Women's March Inc. by late January 2017.
So were other early organizers, leaving Ms. Perez, Ms. Mallory, Linda Sarsour and Mari Lynn Foulger, who calls herself Bob Bland, as co-chairmen. The four were the toast of the "resistance," drawing effusions from prominent Democrats. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called them "the suffragists of our time." Nancy Pelosi praised them as "courageous." The American Civil Liberties Union's magazine lauded Ms. Sarsour as a "leader in the truest form of the word." The ACLU is still a march sponsor, as are the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the American Federation of Teachers -- never mind that three of the four co-chairmen admire Louis Farrakhan.
The Nation of Islam leader makes an unlikely feminist. In one sermon, he ranted about "lazy women" who "don't want to get in the damn kitchen and cook." He is also infamous for his anti-Semitism, including the canard about Jews and the slave trade. In that regard at least, the three Women's March leaders find in him a kindred spirit.
Ms. Sarsour has asserted that Zionists can't be feminists and that "some folks . . . always choose their allegiance to Israel over their commitment to democracy and free speech." She spoke at a 2015 rally a New York Times columnist described as a "pageant for Farrakhan" and has bragged that she has Nation of Islam bodyguards. Throughout 2016 Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez shared a steady stream of Farrakhan quotes and video clips on Instagram. In November 2016 Ms. Perez posted a picture of herself holding hands with Mr. Farrakhan. Ms. Sarsour commented: "God bless him."
In May 2017 -- four months after the first Women's March -- Ms. Mallory posted her own picture with Mr. Farrakhan, calling him the "GOAT," an acronym for "greatest of all time." Ms. Mallory attended a Farrakhan speech in February 2018 in which he denounced Jews as "children of the devil" and gave her a nice personal mention.
Hoping to save the good name of the Women's March, liberals pleaded with its leaders to condemn and abandon Mr. Farrakhan. They wouldn't -- not in 2017 or 2018, and not last week, when Ms. Mallory was questioned about it on "The View."
"I called him the greatest of all time because of what he has done in black communities," Ms. Mallory said. "Just because you go into a space with someone does not mean you agree with everything they say."
The remaining supporters of the Women's March -- including the Democratic Party until last week -- keep telling themselves they can compartmentalize the anti-Semitism and join, praise or even fund the march despite it. The implication is that it's OK to be anti-Semitic as long you're for the left. That was the message of this year's Women's March.

Texto completo: Westbrook's world famous ice disk is ready for its close-up -- at least it better be.
There's now a webcam that broadcasts the daytime movements of the disk, which has been spinning in the Presumpscot River for more than a week and continues its counterclockwise rotation, despite a new covering of several inches of fresh snow over the weekend.
Such disks are known to occur under just the right conditions, but the Westbrook version has the advantage of being unusually large -- about 100 yards across -- and in a downtown location where it's easy to see. And where, perhaps, it's too accessible -- someone planted a small American flag in the disk's center and a rainbow flag on a pole near the edge of the disk.
Although city officials are discouraging anyone from trying to walk onto or otherwise disturb the disk, the flag on the outer edge does allow those monitoring the disk from the comfort of home to spot the steady counterclockwise rotation of the phenomenon.
The image can be found at mooseheadwebcams.com, which primarily has webcam images of various spots around Moosehead Lake in northern Maine.
Tina Radel, the city of Westbrook's marketing and communications manager, said Brown University asked to put up the webcam to monitor the growth and eventual demise of the ice disk. Rob Mitchell, the owner of a building on Ash Street, gave his approval and Ethos Marketing, which is the building's tenant, allowed the college to access its internet network to stream the pictures.
The webcam captures an image once every minute and the site includes a clip of the previous day's images strung together for a time-lapse of the disk that effectively shows it in motion.
Radel said the disk seemed to get a little smaller Sunday as a storm moved into the state, but then appeared to rebound after the precipitation stopped and cold air swept in.
"It actually looks like it grew larger last night," she said.
The disk has attracted worldwide media attention with reports by the BBC, U.S. television networks, The Boston Globe and The New York Times, among others.
The interest seems to have ebbed somewhat, Radel said, although she got emails Monday seeking approval to use time-lapse images -- which Radel put on the city's Facebook page -- from a site in France and from The Washington Post. News about the storm on the East Coast seemed to overwhelm interest in the disk on Saturday and Sunday.
"It slowed down, which was nice for the weekend," she said.
The disk actually stopped spinning last Wednesday when it got stuck to ice on the riverbank. A Freeport man came to the rescue Thursday with a paddleboard and an ice pick and broke it free.
Besides the media attention, the ice disk has drawn crowds to Westbrook as people feel compelled to see the phenomenon in person. That has pleased the operators of downtown business, including one bar that has been serving "Ice Disk Cosmos."

A Digital-Era Frenzy Sweeps Up a School Steeped in Tradition

Texto completo: COVINGTON, Ky. -- On Friday night, all anyone at Covington Catholic High School was talking about was that their star Colonels basketball team had unexpectedly lost to the rival St. Xavier Bombers, 55-45.
For the "Colonel Crazies," as locals call them, identity is wrapped in state championship titles, and their all-male brotherhood.
But by Saturday afternoon, the Northern Kentucky school off the Dixie Highway had been ripped out of its overwhelmingly white, heavily Catholic, and largely Republican world and thrust into a national firestorm that touched seemingly every raw nerve in this polarized country -- race, President Trump and the behavior of young white men.
Videos surfaced of dozens of Covington students in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington after the March for Life, chanting as they do at games, wearing "Make America Great Again" hats and appearing to be in a standoff with an elderly Native American man.
More videos later emerged complicating the story, showing that the encounter had been preceded by African-American protesters, who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites, shouting slurs at the students. When a man with the Hebrew Israelites shouted that the boys had just "one N-word" in their crowd, a student corrected him, "we got two of them."
Nathan Phillips, the Native American man, said he had stepped between the students and the Hebrew Israelites to defuse the tension.
[Read more on what happened between a Native American man and Catholic students.]
By Sunday, after Covington Catholic High School and the Diocese of Covington apologized in a joint statement, the students were being threatened and their private information was being posted online. Some families said they were even receiving death threats.
The community south of the Ohio River began to see itself as facing a politically motivated siege. Families and churches swiftly circled to protect their young men.
Bill Gerdes first heard about what happened when the students pulled into the school's parking lot after the drive back from Washington. His son, who participated in the March for Life, had filmed the incident.
Using an expletive to express his outrage at the news media for its coverage of the students, Mr. Gerdes called the events a "nonstory."
"It should be reported how great these young men did in the face of these protesters who were trying to bait them," he said in a phone interview on Monday, calling the events a political attack against Catholics for their opposition to abortion rights.
"The left has an agenda," he said. "Facts don't really matter to them if it goes against their agenda."
Other parents and friends soon changed their social media profile photos to a blue-and-white "C," in honor of the school's logo.
Covington is famous for its community's fierce devotion. To cheer on their classmates at sporting events, students at times paint their faces and bodies blue.
A video on the school's YouTube channel also depicted some students with their faces and bodies painted black.
After the video emerged on social media and The New York Times contacted the diocese for comment, the school's video was removed from YouTube. The diocese did not respond to request for comment.
At first on Saturday, the high school and the Diocese of Covington said they were investigating.
But as more details emerged, families and community members grew angry at how they were being treated.
One Covington alum, now a commissioner for Kenton County where the school is located, assured the Colonels in a Facebook post that he had their backs, and criticized Mr. Phillips for drumming instead of speaking up for the boys. He signed his post with the school's motto: "With a spirit that will not die."
In nearby downtown Covington, at Sunday evening Mass, the priest at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption said how difficult it was to see loved ones in the media, and he asked the community to pray that the "very difficult situation" would become clear.
After Mass, a parishioner complained that the bishop had "jumped the gun" in apologizing for the students' behavior.
"This Indian is a provocateur, this is what I've heard," the parishioner, Roger Hehman, said. "Initial impressions and perceptions are deceiving."
The school last faced negative scrutiny a month ago, when a 2018 graduate and basketball star, the son of a former Cincinnati Bengals player, was charged with sodomy and rape.
This also is not the first time the greater Cincinnati area's male Catholic school community has had to grapple with allegations of racism. Last winter, young men from Elder High chanted "P.F. Chang" and "'Hey No. 2, open your eyes" at a multiracial Asian player from St. Xavier, perhaps the most prestigious of the all-male Catholic high schools in the region. An African-American player on the team was also taunted.
In the greater Cincinnati area, which has Catholic roots going back nearly 200 years, loyalty to the local Catholic schools runs deep. People wear sweatshirts from the region's many religious schools. In offices on Monday mornings, social talk oftens turns to the results of the weekend's high school football games between the region's many all-male Catholic schools.
At "CovCath," as the school is called locally, this Catholic identity includes the fight against abortion rights. Every day, when students recite the Pledge of Allegiance, they amend the end to say, "with liberty and justice for all, born and unborn."
And each year, students join other Catholic high schools in the area who routinely send busloads of students to the March for Life in Washington, often canceling class so that students can go.
Historically, ahead of the march, the Diocese of Covington publicly prints the name of every Catholic who opposes abortion rights in a multiple-page ad for The Cincinnati Enquirer, listed by parish or school, and includes the names of minors.
A parent at a neighboring Catholic school, Michael Schwartz, recalled his frustration when his son's school printed his name, even though his son had decided not to attend.
"The peer group pressure on these kids is enormous," Mr. Schwartz said. "I feel the diocese should not be putting these kids in what has become potentially more contentious situations, as the inevitable protests to these 'Right to Life' marches increase."
While much of the local fervor has turned to absolving the students of any wrongdoing in the past few days, a few pockets of the Catholic school community hope the incident can be an opportunity for growth. Father Richard Millbourn, who teaches religious studies at St. X, as St. Xavier is commonly called, plans to discuss the episode with his students in the weeks ahead.
"Let's talk about this, so it sticks in their heads," he said in a phone interview on Sunday. "Did you see it, what did you think, how likely is it that you might do something stupid like this?"
Parents like Mr. Gerdes, whose son filmed the controversy, maintain that the students were innocent victims who actually helped de-escalate the situation. Though school administrators initially said they would consider expelling the students, Mr. Gerdes now believes the tide has turned in their favor.
"The videos backed the students, so I'm sure they would be backing off of that now," he said of the threat. "We trust the school, and we trust the diocese that they will protect their flock."

Texto completo: Saturday's Women's March was much smaller than the original, held in 2017. It was notable not only because far fewer showed up but for who stayed away. The Democratic Party disavowed its partnership with the march, as did the Southern Poverty Law Center, Emily's List, the Human Rights Campaign, NARAL, the Center for American Progress and hundreds of other liberal interest groups. The march had 550 official partners in 2018 and less than half as many this year. One by one, the pink hats came off.
What happened? The group that yelled loudest about Mr. Trump's bigotry was brought low by bigotry of its own. Tablet reported last month that at the first meeting to organize the Women's March, four days after Mr. Trump's election, two of the group's leaders, Carmen Perez and Tamika Mallory, insisted that, in the reporters' paraphrase, "Jewish people bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people" and were leaders of the slave trade.

Texto completo: Almost a century ago, a bright, intelligent woman named Elizabeth Seymour Rawlinson roamed the Augusta County countryside looking for plants and writing about her observations of the natural world.
She was a well-known horticulturalist and writer, and I would also categorize her as an early Shenandoah Valley environmentalist.
I have been interested in Elizabeth for a number of years and was recently asked by the Augusta Garden Club to do a presentation about her as part of the club's centennial celebration, so I have been delving into her story in greater detail.
Let me tell you a little more about her and put out a plea for any information that you might have as well that could help me make her story "blossom," so to speak.
Elizabeth, born in 1901, was the only child of Lionel B. and Anne Cochran Rawlinson. Her mother was a Cochran from Folly Farm, the 19th-century estate just south of Staunton on Rt. 11 (the one with the brick serpentine wall). Her father was a British aristocrat from England. He came to America when he was 22 to visit his uncle.
While in Virginia he met his future wife, got married, and the couple settled on land just over the hill from Folly, on Old Greenville Road. There they built Herringstone, named after the Rawlinson estate in England.
Like her mother, Elizabeth was a member of the Augusta Garden Club and the two women used Herringstone as a horticultural experimental station. Much of their work can still be seen today in the trees, shrubs, and flowers that continue to grow there. Elizabeth's obituary noted that the grounds of Herringstone contained "many rare and beautiful plants and shrubs as a result of her skill and knowledge."
And, like both of her parents, Elizabeth was Episcopalian. She, her parents, and her grandparents all attended Trinity Episcopal in Staunton. In her church life at Trinity she was vice-president of the woman's Auxiliary, educational secretary, and an active member of the Altar Guild.
The family was also very involved as the patrons of Good Shepherd Episcopal Church in Folly Mills. Elizabeth's parents gave the land for the church that her grandmother founded. The Augusta Garden Club did all the original landscaping for Good Shepherd.
Elizabeth received her formal education at Stuart Hall and at an all-girls preparatory school called St. Hilda's in Charles Town, W.Va. Where she received her horticultural and botanical training is uncertain.
What is certain is that she was more than an amateur in the field.
In the 1930s her writings were given top billing as a regular columnist in the New York Times, and she had articles in House and Garden and other horticultural journals. She was the editor Garden Gossip, a newsletter published jointly by the Garden Club of Virginia and the Virginia Federation of Garden Clubs.
And she apparently lectured widely on botanical topics. Her will describes camera equipment, a projector, and a screen.
She was very active in garden club events and won numerous awards for her flowers and flower arrangements. In 1935, for instance, she won five first-place awards and two third-place prizes at the Augusta Garden Club Spring Flower Show held at the Stonewall Jackson Hotel. The awards were for lilacs, tulips, Iris, and flower arrangements.
But there was another most intriguing side of her life that I have just started to peer into.
She apparently explored many of the natural areas in Augusta, Nelson, Highland, and Rockingham as well as other places in Virginia. Not only did she explore and write about these special areas with their unique plants, but she collected plant specimens, preserving and documenting them like a trained professional. Where she received training for that and who she corresponded with are all still shrouded in mystery.
Elizabeth Rawlinson's life was tragically cut short in 1942 by cancer – a long and very painful illness according to all accounts – during which she still soldiered on with her botanizing and writing until the very end.
Her will, recorded in the Staunton courthouse, mentions a number of items from her garden and horticultural exploits that now appear to be lost or mostly lost to time. The will mentions a collection of Kodachrome color slides, which no one can find, as well plant collecting equipment, and, to Robert C. Moncure she bequeathed "the black books in which I kept my gardening records."
A 1946 newspaper article about an Augusta Garden Club meeting notes that "Among her bequests was a remarkable collection of wild flowers, dried and mounted, the complete plant, including roots and blossom, with descriptions of the plant habits."
The slides and black garden books have not yet been rediscovered. I have discovered bits and pieces of her herbarium collections, however, but nothing like the hundreds of specimens that she obviously collected.
I have found eight or so items that have been digitized and on line that are scattered in a half dozen institutions and there appears to be a significant number at the Virginia Tech arboretum that have not yet been digitized, but judging from her numbering system, there should be hundreds of plant specimens.
What I have seen are indeed remarkable – the work of a true professional. The plants, collected and preserved by her in the 1930s, were collected from places such as Shenandoah National Park, Magnolia Springs (near Stuarts Draft), Stingy Hollow (near her home), Three Ridge (near Tyro in Nelson), Franklin Hollow (near Craigsville), Briary Branch (near Stokesville), Spring Pond (near Sherando), and a Cold Springs bog (near Greenville).
Elizabeth must have been a remarkable and self-assured woman. If you can help me learn more about Elizabeth Rawlinson, feel free to email me at lotswife@comcast.net or come to the Staunton Library talk in March and find out what more I have learned about Augusta County's very own "plant lady."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When some of my colleagues at The New York Times approached me about doing a health program for our readers, I knew immediately what I didn't want. I didn't want another impossible fitness program. (Some of us find even the 7-Minute Workout too hard!) I knew I didn't want a plan that made readers feel guilty about their choices or bad about themselves.
I've always believed that living well doesn't have to be hard -- it actually makes us really happy! I wanted to create a wellness program that was simple, easy-to-do and, yes, fun. Since launching Well at The New York Times 11 years ago, I've always felt a strong connection with readers and their struggles. I've chronicled my own challenges with losing weight, and I find that when I write about something that personally interests me -- whether it's midlife resilience or the power of surrounding yourself with positive people -- I discover that readers are usually thinking about the same thing.
So, together with a team including designers, developers and editors, I set out to create a wellness program that I would want to do myself. I thought about doing one nice thing for myself every day that helped me move more, that nourished my body, that connected me with loved ones or refreshed my spirit. In the Well section, we have always taken a holistic approach to health, and our coverage reflects that view. We focus on fitness and nutrition, of course, but we also share science-based information on mindfulness, sleep, family, love and friendships.
And so the 30-Day Well Challenge was born. Four days a week, the challenge offers simple tasks that help us nourish our bodies, refresh our minds or connect with those we love. The ideas for these challenges came from scientific research and a number of articles we've written on those topics over the years. The goal was to distill the science down into actionable advice. Research on happy couples became a challenge to reinvent "date night." A much-studied meditation technique became a Sunday refresh challenge. Research on mantras, rewards and gratitude (and even chocolate) all became fun, daily challenges for readers who signed up for the program.
And three days a week, we ask readers to take part in a six-minute move challenge. We wanted to give our readers a unique and fun exercise video. We designed the workout with Chris Jordan, the inventor of the famous 7-Minute Workout, with the goal of creating an even simpler, easier workout aimed at building a regular fitness habit. Once we finalized the exercises and structure of the videos, we asked our designers and video team to create them. That's when the fun began!
Alexandra Eaton, a showrunner in our video department, and Jaspal Riyait, the art director for our Smarter Living group, wanted the stars of these videos to be real women, which led to a casting call.
"We searched for strong, healthy women with a diverse range of athleticism," said Ms. Riyait. "In the end we found Gillian, our yoga lover; Malia, who has entered the world of high-intensity workouts; and Asmeret, a strong believer in the power of movement and strength, a role model to her two young daughters."
One thing we discovered during the casting call is that everyone liked the workout. Most found it to be just challenging enough, although some people wanted the option to modify the workout if needed. So we added some extra tips for readers with mobility issues and suggested they could sub in a workout that works better for them. (There are tips for each workout that can be applied to any exercises.)
The biggest surprise?
"No one loves push-ups!" said Ms. Riyait.
During both the casting call and the video shoot, most of the people we met struggled with correct form while doing push-ups. In the end, we decided this was a plus. Real people struggle with push-ups -- they are rarely perfect. Many of us can't stay straight head to hips doing a push-up. Instead we bend at the hips to make the exercise a little easier. After many conversations with Mr. Jordan, we decided it was O.K. if our push-ups weren't perfect. Malia nailed hers, but we allowed Asmeret and Gillian -- and anyone doing the challenge -- to slightly modify the perfect push-up if needed.
To keep the videos visually interesting, we gave Asmeret, Malia and Gillian each a color theme and a wardrobe change for each exercise. Jordy Huinder helped by finding a great variety of workout outfits to create a sophisticated but still playful feel to the video. "The reasoning behind the constant wardrobe changes was to make these videos engaging every time you watched and to inspire all body types," Ms. Riyait said.
The actual video shoot was a fun day. Asmeret, Malia and Gillian were all great sports. Everyone on set tried the exercises. Music was pumping and our on-site personal trainer, Mikee Richardson, did a great job keeping everyone motivated.
But the best part of creating the 30-Day Well Challenge has been the tremendous response we have received from our readers.
"I love how short the intervals are (I mostly need gentle inspiration to get started) and how the women used in the videos are healthy and fit looking, but not emaciated," one reader wrote.
"Thank you for giving me hope and something to work on to improve myself," said another reader. "Your program feels like a connection with others with a common goal of health."
I hope after reading this even more readers will do something nice for themselves and try the 30-Day Well Challenge, which starts the Monday after you sign up. (A digital subscription is not required, though you do need to register so we can send you your reminders.) We've got some other fun ideas brewing for future challenges, so we would love to get even more feedback!

'Glass' Dominates At the Box Office

Texto completo: For a weekend dominated by M. Night Shyamalan, there weren't many twists at the box office.
Universal's "Glass," a superhero successor to the director Shyamalan's "Unbreakable" and "Split" that stars Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and James McAvoy, sold an estimated $40.6 million in tickets during its first weekend in North American theaters, easily topping the chart at the end of a relatively quiet week.
"Glass" completes a trilogy that started in 2000 with "Unbreakable," a superhero thriller that introduced audiences to David Dunn (Willis), a football player-turned-security guard with superhuman abilities, and Elijah Price (Jackson), a comic-book theorist. While that film was successful at the box office and has since developed a cult following, its sales were modest compared to those of Shyamalan's previous blockbuster, "The Sixth Sense," which was the second-highest-grossing movie of 1999.
With "Glass," Universal was likely hoping to combine the cult status of "Unbreakable" with the box-office momentum created by "Split," which came out in early 2017. The latter movie, which stars McAvoy as a kidnapper with multiple personalities, was a surprise hit, making about $138.3 million domestically during its time in theaters against a production budget of just $9 million, according to Box Office Mojo.
"Split" made about $40 million during its opening weekend, so "Glass" is performing comparably -- though it seems unlikely that the movie will wildly outpace "Split," particularly given mixed reviews from critics. ("Glass" has a 36 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.)
In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie "enjoyable," but wrote that its "air of misterioso quiet and encroaching, consuming terror give way to manly growling, jaw-clenching and vein-popping, and everything falls to pieces in a poorly conceptualized and staged blowout."
STX's "The Upside," which was No. 1 in ticket sales last weekend despite the controversy surrounding Kevin Hart, one of its stars, came in second place with about $15.7 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data.
Aside from "Glass," the only other newcomer in the top five was Funimation's "Dragon Ball Super: Broly," a Japanese anime movie and the latest entry in the long-running "Dragon Ball" franchise, which made $8.7 million during its opening weekend to finish fourth.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The 'Grand Old Man' of Daily World sports

Texto completo: If Bobby wrote it, you can depend on it being true, well-written, grammatically correct and properly punctuated. Everything a newspaper article should be, but often isn't.
Several weeks ago the Daily World described writer Bobby Ardoin as the "Grand Old Man" of the sports section. Yes, he's written various articles for the sports page for more than 50 years, but Bobby is so much more than that.
First of all, there is the "Old Man" part of the title, to which I take exception. I am a year older than Bobby, and although we may be "of a certain age," we are not old. Again, we are not old. But if the Daily World wants to call Bobby a "Grand Old Man," so be it. It was definitely meant as a compliment, and compliments are certainly in order.
I have known Bobby since we were youngsters at A.I.C., now Opelousas Catholic, and he was quiet and unassuming, but observant of everything. He freely expressed his opinions, but they were based on facts that he had observed — no "fake news."
That continues today. If Bobby wrote it, you can depend on it being true, well-written, grammatically correct and properly punctuated. Everything a newspaper article should be, but often isn't. (If one more national "journalist" writes that something "centers around" something else, I'm going to start emailing sarcastic corrections — be afraid, New York Times).
Bobby's interest in sports journalism was first recognized officially when he attended Northwestern State University in Natchitoches. He soon became the sports editor for the college newspaper.
Bobby then transferred to USL, and after graduating, he started writing for the Daily World back in the early 1970s. Although this was always a part-time job — he was also a full-time teacher — he was very productive and wrote about local high school sports events, and the occasional college and professional contests.
He also covered regional high school sports — my sister Clelie, a classmate of Bobby's, specifically recalls his stories about the SunKist Basketball Tournament sponsored by St. Thomas More High School in Lafayette. This was at one time a multi-state tournament attracting high schools as far away as Memphis, and Bobby was there.
James Douget, coach/teacher at Krotz Springs, also recalled Bobby's excellent sports coverage over the years. Bobby reported the facts and was not just a cheerleader for the local teams. Douget was particularly impressed with the variety of sports figures that Bobby knew from around the state.
Cousin Phil Castille, another classmate of Bobby's, remembers him as an excellent baseball player in the summer leagues at City Park. I remember Phil's career in those same leagues, as well as mine: our motto was, "Go for the walk." Someone else must have written about Bobby; nobody wrote about us. We rarely did anything that was newsworthy.
At some point in his early career as a sports reporter, Bobby worked for the ill-fated Opelousas/St. Landry Today newspaper (1978-1987), and he was pretty much the highlight of that paper while it lasted. I seem to recall that Eddie Lopez had a brief stint as a columnist for the same paper, but sports was not Eddie's forte and he wisely left that to Bobby.
Instead, Eddie wrote about local politicians in a way that was very amusing to most everyone except the local politicians. He didn't last long.
Bobby, on the other hand, has endured, not only covering sports, but local and regional politics, news events, and articles of special interest. In all of his reporting he tells the facts, accurately and concisely, lets the events speak for themselves, and allows the readers to reach their own conclusions.
Bobby accomplished all of this while also being employed as a full-time teacher at Opelousas High School, a position from which he recently retired. According to his wife, Kay, he couldn't decide which career he enjoyed the most, so he pursued them both, and he did them both remarkably well.
With his retirement from teaching, he now has more time to devote to journalism and to other interests, including historic preservation. He is on the board of directors of the St. Landry Preservationists.
As a teenager, Bobby was familiar with the Preservationists' historic Michel Prudhomme House and the keg of beer that then-owner Ruth Fontenot usually had on hand. Bobby and Freddie, her youngest son, were classmates and fellow imbibers.
Over the years, Bobby has also sipped a few beers at a few area bars, and while not a Hell's Angel, he drove a moped in high school. Just another wild and crazy guy, but his devotion to journalism dominated.
To conclude: if Bobby wrote it, you can depend on it being the truth. He is a journalist in the best sense of that word. I would say that Bobby is the "Grand Old Man" of the entire Daily World, not just the sports section.

Texto completo: Regina Hall and Don Cheadle parody 1980s Wall Street in "Black Monday" on Showtime. And "High Maintenance" returns for a third season on HBO.
What's on TV
BLACK MONDAY 10 p.m. on Showtime. The cocaine flows and the cash is blown in Showtime's claustrophobic new half-hour comedy series, which dresses Regina Hall and Don Cheadle up in 1980s garb and attempts to bottle the trembling energy of a B-level Wall Street brokerage firm operating on the brink of a stock market crash. Cheadle plays Maurice Monroe, the head of the firm, who delights in riding in a Lamborghini limousine and whose response when presented with a bag of cocaine as a birthday gift in the first episode is to say, "You guys get me." Dawn Darcy, played by Hall, is an expert trader; Andrew Rannells plays an eggheaded Wall Street newcomer.
CRASHING 10 p.m. on HBO. Following in the footsteps of shows like "Seinfeld" and "Mulaney," this big-hearted comedy series features the stand-up comic Pete Holmes playing a version of himself. When the series picked up, Holmes's character was spat out of a crumbling marriage and into the New York comedy scene. In the third season, debuting Sunday night, his character -- a spiritual comedian -- is returning to the city from a college comedy tour and plunging into a new romance. "While I love 'Louie,' and 'Seinfeld,' those are about successful comedians," Holmes told The New York Times in 2017. "We're telling a story of what it's like to hand out fliers in exchange for stage time at 1 in the morning at a club for five people. And that's such richer kind of tapestry to explore."
HIGH MAINTENANCE 10:30 p.m. on HBO. With the legalization of marijuana in New York State seemingly on the brink of becoming a reality, how will "The Guy" -- the pot dealer and only constant character in Katja Blichfeld and Ben Sinclair's exploration of the lives of fictional New Yorkers -- maintain his livelihood? The debut episode of the show's third season on HBO (it started out as a Vimeo web series) offers what could be viewed as a glimpse: The Guy (Sinclair) doesn't sell anything. Instead, the multithreaded episode follows the aftermath of a death in upstate New York. As a friend of the deceased (Erin Markey) copes with grief by eating onion pizza and drinking craft beer, a new romance is born when The Guy meets a local soul (Britt Lower).
What's Streaming
STAR TREK: DISCOVERY streaming on CBS All Access. CBS's "Star Trek" prequel series has made two important changes in its second season: tighter plot structuring and the addition of the comedian Tig Notaro, who plays a heroic officer. The new season's debut episode, Sopan Deb wrote in The Times, "has everything that the best episodes of 'Trek' have historically had: a mystery, excellent ensemble work with a genuine sense of camaraderie, action scenes that don't overwhelm the plot and most importantly, genuine fun." It also features the show's flagship ship, the Enterprise, remade with current-day graphics.

Texto completo: August 15 is the Feast of the Assumption, a "holy day of obligation," when Catholics are expected to attend Mass. This year millions of Catholics went to church sick at heart. I was among them.
The day before, the attorney general of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had released a grand-jury report declaring that hundreds of Catholic priests had sexually abused minors. The grand jury's conclusions were summarized in reports that landed on the front pages of the New York Times and other newspapers around the world, as well as lead stories on all sorts of television news programs. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro spoke on "Today" and nightly news broadcasts. No Catholics serious about their faith, indeed no one of any sensitivity, could have read about the report without feeling horror and shame. And anger. It was bad enough to read graphic accounts of anal and oral rape, sometimes combined with sacrilegious perversities; it was doubly appalling to be told that church leaders had systematically covered up these crimes and allowed abusers to go unchecked.
Within hours, the Pennsylvania grand-jury report was propelled to international status. The Vatican expressed "shame and sorrow." Adjectives piled up from Catholic and secular sources: abominable, revolting, reprehensible, nauseating, diabolical. The New York Times editorialized on "The Catholic Church's Unholy Stain."
Months have passed but the report's impact has not. At least a dozen states have announced they would follow Pennsylvania in conducting their own investigations (Illinois issued a preliminary report in December); the Justice Department has suggested that it, too, might get into the act. Pope Francis has called for bishops from around the world to address the sex-abuse scandal at the Vatican in February, where the Pennsylvania report will undoubtedly be a chief exhibit-as it currently is for Catholics both on the right and the left writing farewells to the church.
In fact, the report makes not one but two distinct charges. The first one concerns predator priests, their many victims and their unspeakable acts. That charge is, as far as can be determined, dreadfully true. Appalling as is this first charge, it is in fact the second one that has had the greatest reverberations. "All" of these victims, the report declares, "were brushed aside, in every part of the state, by church leaders who preferred to protect the abusers and their institutions above all." Or as the introduction to the report sums it up, "Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all."
What now?
As of this writing, a dozen or more states and the federal government are signaling intentions to follow Pennsylvania's lead in investigating clergy sex abuse in the Catholic church. Just before leaving office, the attorney general of Illinois specifically cited the Pennsylvania model (and duplicated some of its faults) in a preliminary headline-grabbing report. It is possible that these investigations could be productive and salutary. But only if they make distinctions between dioceses, leaders and time frames. Only if they recognize changes over time in the larger society's understanding and openness about sexual abuse. Only if they provide perspective by comparisons with other institutions. Only if they engage honestly with diverse or contrary viewpoints, including those of church officials. Only if they are written in a way that expresses necessary, justifiable repulsion toward crimes against children and young people without burying all efforts at analysis in a mudslide of outrage.
Only, in short, if they do better than Pennsylvania.
That is for the future. For the present, the important thing is to restore some fact-based reality to the instant mythology that the Pennsylvania report has created.
A need for investigation
What does the report document? It documents decades of stomach-churning violations of the physical, psychological, and spiritual integrity of children and young people. It documents that many of these atrocities could have been prevented by promptly removing the credibly suspected perpetrators from all priestly roles and ministry. It documents that some, although far from all, of those failures were due to an overriding concern for protecting the reputation of the church and the clergy and a reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of children. It also documents that a good portion of these crimes, perhaps a third or more, only came to the knowledge of church authorities in 2002 or after, when the Dallas Charter mandated automatic removal from ministry. It documents, well before 2002, many conscientious attempts to determine the truth of accusations and prevent any further abuse, often successful though sometimes poorly executed or tragically misinformed. It documents significant differences between dioceses and bishops and time periods in the response to allegations of abuse. It documents major changes in vigilance and response in some dioceses during the 1990s and, as far as the evidence shows, dramatic changes after 2002.
What does the report not document? It does not document the sensational charges contained in its introduction - namely, that over seven decades Catholic authorities, in virtual lockstep, supposedly brushed aside all victims and did absolutely nothing in the face of terrible crimes against boys and girls-except to conceal them. This ugly, indiscriminate, and inflammatory charge, unsubstantiated by the report's own evidence, to say nothing of the evidence the report ignores, is truly unworthy of a judicial body responsible for impartial justice.
Why the media were so amenable to uncritically echoing this story without investigation, and why Catholics in particular were so eager to seize on it to settle their internal differences, are important topics for further discussion.
It is true that disturbing instances of apparent failures by church officials continue to come to light-and will no doubt continue to do so, especially as the line between past cases and current ones is regularly blurred, and as cases from all around the world are increasingly blended with a few American ones into a single narrative. Church leaders must remove persistent doubts that these failures are being thoroughly investigated, with consequences for those found responsible.
Moving forward
Doing that will not be easy. The prevalent story about Catholic clergy sex abuse as deeply entrenched, largely unabated, and uniquely Catholic is now so embedded in the media as to make it resistant to evidence to the contrary, which, at least for the United States, is ample and well-documented.
In the case of Pennsylvania, whether one looks at the handling of old allegations or the prevention of new ones, the conclusion that a careful, unbiased reading of the Pennsylvania report compels is this: the Dallas Charter has worked. Not worked perfectly, not without need for regular improvements and constant watchfulness. But worked. Justified alarm and demands for accountability at instances of either deliberate noncompliance or bureaucratic incompetence should not be wrenched into an ill-founded pretense that, fundamentally, nothing has changed.
This conclusion does not acquit the Catholic hierarchy of all sins, past or present. Personally I have a substantial list. Nor is it impossible that some other states may vary from Pennsylvania. But just as the grand-jury report correctly though not consistently points to "institutional failure," something beyond the virtues and vices of individual leaders, the Dallas Charter has apparently proved to be an institutional success. It set out, and has regularly fine-tuned, procedures, practices, and standards that can be overseen by middling caretaker leaders as well as outstanding, proactive ones.
The Dallas Charter is decidedly not a recipe that can simply be transferred to any society or culture or legal and governmental situation around the globe. But American bishops should go to the Vatican's February summit meeting on sexual abuse confident that the measures they've already adopted have made an important difference.

A conspiracy of dunces

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Women's March 2019: Activists continue protest despite stiff headwinds

Resumen: The third edition of the Women's March faces difficult conditions, from controversy over charges of anti-Semitism to rough weather.

Texto completo: It started as a statement of defiance after the election of Donald Trump, morphed into a mobilizing force at the polls, and now, as it approaches its third iteration, the Women’s March is focusing on fighting for its policy priorities.
Themes such as opposition to Trump, ending violence against women and the pursuit of equality are sure to take center stage during scheduled demonstrations in Washington and about 350 sites across the country Saturday, just short of the two-year anniversary of the historic first march.
As it grows into its political power, the movement is running into headwinds in the form of a splintered leadership and accusations of anti-Semitism against some of the original organizers.
The controversy, which prompted the Democratic National Committee and other groups to distance themselves from the Washington event, threatens to erode the movement’s gains, or at least slow its progress.
A cause that two years ago drew 3. 3 million to 5. 2 million nationwide, making it probably the largest demonstration in U. S. history, now may be lucky to attract half that many.
Besides lacking the immediate outrage over Trump’s election or midterms to serve as motivators, the marches face obstacles in the increased travel inconveniences created by the federal shutdown, in addition to harsh weather. Major winter storm Harper is forecast to pound large stretches from the Midwest to the Northeast with rain, snow and wind over the weekend.
“This is the heaviest lift they’re going to have,’’ said University of Maryland sociology professor Dana R. Fisher, author of the upcoming book “American Resistance. ’’
“In general, getting people to march in the winter is tough. It’s a hard ask, and right now there’s not an obvious goal, except for perhaps 2020 (the general election). I know Women’s March Inc. says they’re trying to use this as a pivot to start talking about doing more policy-based work, but I think that’s not a good mobilizer. ’’

Diminished interest is to be expected in a non-election year. After the enthusiasm generated by the first march, the movement spurred a spike in female activism before the 2018 midterms, in the form of candidates and involvement in campaigns.
Women, especially those in the suburbs, helped drive the Democrats’ 40-seat gain in the House of Representatives, flipping control of that chamber. A record 102 women – 89 of them Democrats – were voted into the House in November.

“You can draw a direct line from the 5 million who marched that day and our effort after that to impact elections to the makeup of the current Congress as the most diverse Congress that’s ever been elected,’’ said Vanessa Wruble, one of the leading organizers of the first march. “Already you see the movement shifting from reactive to proactive. ’’
But as Wruble knows all too well, the cause has been shaken by distrust and divisiveness, which she said began the very first day she and six other women met to lay down plans for the march.
A detailed story by the Jewish online magazine Tablet said Women’s March board members Tamika Mallory and Carmen Perez – whom Wruble recruited to add diversity to the original organizing group of four – confronted her about the role Jews had in oppressing minorities of color.
Wruble, who is Jewish, was asked to leave the group shortly after the first march, and she told The New York Times her religion was a factor. She later co-founded March On, an organization that provides support and guidance to women-led groups throughout the country, and estimates 50 percent of Saturday’s sister marches will have gotten help from the group.
Fisher said the controversy is clearly taking a toll.
“Women’s March Inc. does not own the women’s movement, and it certainly does not own this march, which has been so much a combination of all of these locally distributed efforts across the country,’’ she said. “It’s a shame all of the bad press is having this effect. ’’
WMI declined to make any of its board members available for an interview, instead forwarding one of the multiple denials of anti-Semitism the group has issued since the dispute erupted.
Its case was undermined when Mallory, a Women’s March co-president, appeared on ABC’s “The View’’ on Monday and declined to denounce the frequent anti-Semitic statements by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whom she has publicly lauded.
WMI provided a statement about the concurrent marches programmed for Saturday, most of which are not affiliated with the group.

“Women's March is an organic movement, made of the fierce energy and power of millions of women and those who support them,’’ the statement said. “We're thrilled to see hundreds of marches sprout up in small towns, suburbs, and cities across America and around the globe. In 2017, we marched. In 2018, we took our power to the polls. In 2019, we're coming with an agenda created by women and for the people. ’’
In addition to addressing violence against women, that agenda includes items such as reproductive rights, racial justice and immigrant rights. The objectives are worthwhile enough for sponsors like the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood to remain on board.
A coalition of more than 100 supporters of the Jewish Women of Color signed a letter standing firm with the Women’s March.
On the other hand, the Jewish Democratic Council of America issued a statement joining the DNC and other groups pulling away from the Women’s March organization, though not the cause itself.
The diverging stances may diffuse the movement’s message.
“I think there’s obviously some confusion because people don’t know how the sausages are made, and what’s being revealed now is actually how the sausages were made,’’ said Wruble, who favors a decentralized operation. “The media had focused on a small group of people who were some of the organizers of one march. "
Julie Goldscheid, a law professor at City University of New York who has written about gender and equality law, said the focus should be on the overall accomplishments of the women’s marches, which along with the MeToo# movement have brought attention to issues of inequality women regularly confront.
She said the activism behind those causes has carried over into workplace changes in many sectors, from the corporate level to farm workers.
“Whatever the disagreements may be among the leaders or different perspectives or struggles to understand one another,’’ Goldscheid said, “it’s really important for us to remember how much really productive work is being done to fight violence, to fight discrimination on the basis of gender, on the basis of race, on the basis of religion, and all other forms of discrimination that are still so rampant. ’’

Texto completo: "We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."
Douglas Cox, chairman of the Menominee Indian Tribe
GREEN BAY - The children had just awakened from a nap and were still rubbing sleep from their eyes when they pulled up tiny chairs at two small U-shaped tables.
Bowing their heads to say grace in their Oneida native language, the Head Start students were about to snack on Kiwi slices and rice cakes washed down with cups of water.
The Oneida Nation spends $233,000 annually on its Head Start program, which oversees 152 children at two locations on the reservation. Almost three-fourths of Head Start funding for the Green Bay-area tribe is paid through federal funds — roughly $172,000.
But all federal funds flowing to the Oneida and other Wisconsin tribes, as well as Indian tribes across the country, have dried up since the federal government shutdown.
Wisconsin tribes are using their own funds to continue to provide education, health, law enforcement, food pantries and other services, but if the shutdown lasts much longer — and there's no sign of the impasse ending any time soon — some services could be curtailed or cut, hiring might be frozen, workers could be laid off and other drastic measures taken.
"We're fortunate we have the infrastructure and manpower here. A lot of tribes don't have that," Oneida Vice Chairman Brandon Yellowbird Stevens said. "We can supplant the loss of funds with emergency contingency funding."
But the tribe's emergency funding is not limitless and it's designed for emergencies, and no one knows how long the federal shutdown, already the longest, will last.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, the New York Times reported.
When Oneida self-government coordinator Candice Skenandore tries to contact someone at the bureau, which she does daily for her job, she gets automatic email replies that the person she's trying to reach is on furlough for an indefinite time. It's the same for voicemail.
Skenandore is in the middle of negotiations for a new funding agreement for the tribe's health services and she's waiting for grant approvals and funding OKs for several programs. But everything is on hold and Skenandore knows it will take several weeks, if not months, for federal employees to get up to speed once the shutdown ends.
Skenandore is supposed to attend a tribal self-governance advisory board meeting in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, but she's not sure if the meeting will be held.
The shutdown "is stopping us from doing what we need to do to improve our health services," said Skenandore, whose position is federally funded. The tribe is paying her salary during the shutdown.
About 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive basic services from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some tribes, like the Oneida, administer services funded by BIA money, while other tribes have their programs run by federal workers, many of whom are tribal members.
Services tied to decades-old treaties Because of treaties negotiated decades ago, the money funneled to tribes for health care, education, law enforcement and other services is in exchange for tribal nations giving up millions of acres of land in the 1800s. In effect, the tribes prepaid with land for funds now held up by the shutdown.
There's no guarantee tribes will ever see that money. Stevens said the Oneida tribe never got the money it was owed and was not paid during the government shutdown of 2013.
"We ceded millions of acres of land and, in return, the United States said they would pay for health and education," Stevens said.
The Oneida tribe was based in New York at the time and gave up 3 million acres. It later moved to Wisconsin.
Stevens points out that the Oneida were among America's first allies, fighting alongside American troops and helping feed George Washington's army when it was hunkered down at Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777. The tribe continues to receive a symbolic annuity payment of $1,800 each year from the Treasury Department as part of a treaty signed at the end of the Revolutionary War.
The tribe operates a 48-bed nursing home and a health center that handles 350,000 patient visits annually, offering family practice, internal medicine, behavioral health, dental, optical and public health services among other things. Its pharmacy dispenses between 1,000 and 1,200 prescriptions daily, said Debbie Danforth, comprehensive health director for operations.
Last week Danforth was on a conference call with other tribal health directors and learned that while some tribes are able to continue to provide services during the shutdown like the Oneida, some might have to close their clinics in a few weeks.
'It's truly scary' "It's truly scary for some tribes," Danforth said.
Of the Oneida Nation's roughly $490 million 2019 fiscal year budget, about $50 million comes from federal grants and self-governance funds.
There are 17,165 enrolled members in the Oneida tribe with more than 4,400 living on the reservation, including 1,000 who are 55 or older.
"Our message to Congress: these should not be discretionary, we shouldn't be the first to be cut," Stevens said.
Wisconsin's other tribes are facing the same difficulties as the Oneida.
The Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is the largest employer in Shawano County with about 900 employees.
The tribe does not have its own school system but provides tutors and a public safety officer for school districts where tribal members attend, in Gresham and Bowler.
It handles snowplowing and repairing roads for many smaller communities in Shawano County.
About 1,475 people are enrolled in the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe with 500 living on the reservation.
"But many of those are aging so their health care needs are great," Stockbridge-Munsee President Shannon Holsey said.
"A majority of our citizens are no longer in the workforce. They're living on fixed incomes and they look to the tribal nations for needs such as transportation to medical appointments and healthy food distribution through Meals on Wheels," Holsey said.
The biggest priority for the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is its rural health clinic in Bowler, which offers general medicine, dental, behavioral health, chiropractic and community health services as well as a pharmacy.
Since there are no buses or public transportation, the tribe shuttles members who cannot get to a doctor on their own and sends a registered nurse to help people who forget to take their medicine.
The tribe is paying for services normally provided by federal funds out of its reserves but Holsey said there's a limit to that, especially for a small tribe like the Stockbridge-Munsee.
Lac du Flambeau tightens spending Two weeks into the shutdown, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa decided to freeze all capital expenditures until further notice and told employees to be frugal in spending. Not all federal grants have been affected by the shutdown but some have and tribal administrators are meeting regularly with the tribe's accounting staff.
"We want to avoid disruption in services wherever possible and we are working carefully to determine the impact to our general fund and to avoid layoffs," Lac du Flambeau President Joseph Wildcat Sr. said in a statement.
The Menominee Indian Tribe is also using reserve funds to keep essential programs open, Chairman Douglas Cox said.
Like all tribes, the Menominee use a mix of funding to pay for services ranging from a police force and tribal court system to a large health clinic and K-8 school. Menominee Indian High School is a state school district and is not affected by the shutdown.
There are 9,300 enrolled Menominee members with about 4,000 living on or near the reservation.
Cox estimates about 60 percent of the tribe's $19 million annual operating budget is funded through federal grants. Cox and other leaders are reviewing the tribe's finances daily during the shutdown to ensure services continue to be provided.
Cox is worried money due to the tribes from this federal government shutdown will never be paid because Congress would have to approve paying those funds separately.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous," Cox said in a phone interview.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous."

Texto completo: Those living in Cajun Country would argue that gumbo is alive and well, thank you very much
Cajuns might take issue with a Jan. 8 article in the New York Times that explores how gumbo has evolved on restaurant menus in New Orleans. The story's headline is controversial enough on its own: "Gumbo, the classic New Orleans dish, is dead. Long live gumbo." Those in Cajun Country would argue that gumbo is alive and well, thank you very much, and it does not belong to New Orleans. Gumbo is the go-to meal in Acadiana when the temperature dips below 80 degrees, and the staple dish isn't just found in home kitchens. It's still readily available at just about every restaurant that serves local cuisine.
But Brett Anderson's reporting in the New York Times is insightful if you can get beyond the eye-catching headline.
His article argues that gumbo is not the fixture in New Orleans restaurants that it once was — that new chefs at new restaurants are catering to new residents who settled in the Crescent City after Hurricane Katrina.
"The chefs who have stuck by the dish are using the moment to stretch its boundaries by adding ingredients that defy tradition, bringing it fresh relevance," Anderson wrote.
"Many of the innovations reflect global influences on New Orleans cooking, particularly from South and Southeast Asia. This time of year, with the cooler weather and the start of the Mardi Gras season, may be the best time to sample them — and to appreciate gumbo's long and continuing evolution."
Some of the innovative gumbos mentioned in the article include:
A curried Indian gumbo with ginger, turmeric and cilantro at Saffron NOLA
An Asian seafood gumbo with lime leaf, fermented black beans and black cardamom at Maypop
A black-eyed pea and pork gumbo with braised collard greens at Cochon
A modern gumbo with tamarind paste, potato chips, Worcestershire sauce and leeks at Turkey and the Wolf
A smoked chicken and Thai curry gumbo at Marjie's Grill
An oyster gravy/gumbo with grated mirliton squash, jasmine rice and fried jerk-spiced oysters at Bywater American Bistro
Although my gut instinct is to declare that these dishes are not gumbo — as some sources in the story also point out — I cannot help but think back to gumbo's humble roots.
Historically, gumbo was a dish of resourcefulness made with whatever ingredients were available.
Its origins can be traced back to the late 1700s in south Louisiana.
Gumbo, as most of us know it, did not exist.
The earliest gumbos did not start with the famed phrase "first you make a roux" that many modern-day area cooks use. Instead, either the African okra — brought to the area by slaves — or the Native American Choctaw filé powder — derived from sassafras leaves — were used to thicken gumbo.
The most primitive gumbos were not served over rice, either. They were typically served over cornmeal mush.
So who's to say that these New Orleans gumbos aren't actually gumbos?
Leah Chase, a 96-year-old chef and co-owner of the Creole restaurant Dooky Chase's in New Orleans, said it best when she learned about the Indian gumbo at Saffron NOLA.
"I would never dream of putting curry in my gumbo," she told Anderson for the New York Times article. But after thinking about it for a moment, her tone softened.
"That's their version of gumbo," she said. "That's good."
Those living in Cajun Country would argue that gumbo is alive and well, thank you very much

Somehow she was criticized for being 'inspirational'

Texto completo: "Wild Geese" was trending on Twitter on Thursday, and poetry lovers - not naturalists or ornithologists - were responsible. Mary Oliver, arguably America's most beloved best-selling poet, had died earlier in the day, at the age of 83. Her poem "Wild Geese," from her 1986 collection "Dream Work," was written in the second person, so the poet seems to be speaking directly to us. It ends this way:
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting - over and over announcing your place in the family of things. As the news of her death spread across the country and around the world, my social media feeds filled with poems, quotes, links to Oliver's work and personal stories. What struck me was how many people were moved to tears by her death, people who had never met her. Her work touched millions of people deeply, and not only those who consider themselves poets or poetry lovers. Oliver's work managed to do something rare: It reached people who didn't particularly like or "get" contemporary poetry.
She once told NPR that simplicity was important to her. "Poetry, to be understood, must be clear," she said. "It mustn't be fancy." But her work has been criticized by some for its simplicity. Oliver's poems have been labeled "inspirational" and "accessible," and while those adjectives may sound positive, they are too often backhanded compliments. I think this criticism comes from a deep misunderstanding of her work, and also from an ugly disdain for poetry that consoles and inspires. Dare I call it snobbery?
Oliver certainly received critical acclaim in her lifetime, too. Her fifth collection of poetry, "American Primitive," won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1984. Her "New and Selected Poems" (1992) won the National Book Award. Her many honors and awards include a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry, the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America and a number of honorary doctorates.
Yes, Oliver's poems are eminently quotable. Yes, they inspire. They speak to people who have found much of contemporary poetry befuddling. But the poems also speak for themselves. They are full of wisdom and joy and deep loneliness and gratitude. As someone who loves challenging, genre-bending poetry, I also love the poems of Mary Oliver.
Oliver was born in Ohio, so I like to claim her as a fellow Ohio poet. She lived in Provincetown, Mass., from the 1960s until the death of her partner, Molly Malone Cook, in 2005. She was living in southern Florida at the time of her death. Though the bulk of Oliver's poems are set on the northwest tip of Cape Cod, I can't help but see in them so much of our shared Ohio landscape: the deer, the birds, the grass, the water, the trees, the light and the darkness.
"I spent a great deal of time in my younger years just writing and reading, walking around the woods in Ohio, where I grew up," Oliver said in a 2011 interview in O Magazine. "I very much wished not to be noticed, and to be left alone, and I sort of succeeded."
I, too, spent much of my Ohio childhood walking among trees or with my nose in a book. Like Oliver, I started writing in my teens and published my first book at 28. And, yes, my work is concerned with place. It is full of deer, birds, fields, rivers, trees, light and darkness.
In a sense, Mary Oliver, and another Ohio poet, James Wright, gave me permission to write about Ohio's flora and fauna. It was only natural - no pun intended - for me to write about what I saw every day and to build metaphors using my surroundings. It did not surprise me to learn that Whitman, Emerson, Keats and Rumi were some of Oliver's favorite poets. These are poets of big ideas, poets who used metaphor - often based in the natural world - to build a bridge or open a door.
I learned from Mary Oliver how attention is a kind of love, how shining your mind's light on a thing - a grasshopper, a bird, a tree - is a way of showing gratitude. I learned that poems do not need to be "difficult" to be intelligent, that poems can be both inspirational and investigative, that poems can be tender without being soft. I learned from her to own my wonder and to stay open to uncertainty.
The most famous, most shared Mary Oliver quote has to be from her poem "The Summer Day," from "House of Light" (1990), which ends, "Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?"
What did Mary Oliver do with her one wild and precious life? She survived a difficult childhood. She loved a woman for 50 years. She wrote poems that will stand the test of time. She touched us.

Trump and Lindsey Graham; The South Carolina senator has reasons to back the President.

Texto completo: Some media folk and leftist politicians have lately been wondering aloud why Sen. Lindsey Graham, who harshly criticized rival presidential candidate Donald Trump prior to the 2016 election, now often supports the President.
Given that Mr. Graham is the new Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee and Mr. Trump has worked with the Senate to seat a full 85 federal judges plus two Supreme Court justices of the caliber of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh--and also managed along the way to marginalize the political activists at the American Bar Association--perhaps a better question is: why would Sen. Graham not look for opportunities to support the President?
Today highlights another reason why Mr. Graham and Mr. Trump are not such an odd couple. For years Sen. Graham has been attempting to persuade his Senate colleagues to support a particular change in federal law. On Thursday he announced:
I am proud to once again introduce the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, this time as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. There are only seven countries that allow wholesale abortions at the 20-week period, including China and North Korea. The United States should not be in that club. I don't believe abortion, five months into pregnancy, makes us a better nation. America is at her best when she's standing up for the least among us and the sooner we pass this legislation into law, the better. We are on the right side of history.
Earlier today President Trump issued a proclamation :
Today marks the 46th year since the United States Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. On this day, National Sanctity of Human Life Sunday, we mourn the lives cut short, and the tremendous promise lost, as a result of abortion. As a Nation, we must resolve to protect innocent human life at every stage.
As President, I am committed to defending the Right to Life. During my first week in office, I reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which prevents foreign aid from being used to fund or support the global abortion industry. We are also working to end the abhorrent practice of elective late-term abortion, a practice allowed in only seven countries around the world...
Mr. Graham and Mr. Trump seem to have something in common.
***
Selling SandersCare Perhaps the left has now realized that the relatively lightly-regulated, corporate-tax-rate-cutting economies of Scandinavia aren't really models of socialism. Observe the renewed effort to defend the indefensible regimes that really are Marxist. Nicholas Kristof claims in the New York Times:
Cuba has the Medicare for All that many Americans dream about.
"Cuba's example is important since for decades 'health care for all' has been more than a slogan there," said Dr. Paul Farmer, the legendary globe-trotting founder of Partners in Health. "Cuban families aren't ruined financially by catastrophic illness or injury, as happens so often elsewhere in the neighborhood."
That last sentence is true. Cubans are ruined financially long before they ever develop a catastrophic illness or injury. In 2015 Fred Dews of the Brookings Institution reported that "the take home salary for most Cubans is around $20 a month." More recently, the CIA World Factbook placed its estimated per capita income below that of Venezuela and just ahead of Nauru.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - If you want proof that 9/11 has been consigned to history and is no longer viewed as the spark of a permanent existential terrorist threat to the United States, this partial government shutdown headed toward its fourth week should provide it.
It's hard to imagine this kind of shutdown occurring in the days, months and even the first few years after the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Then, airport security became national security.
Today, with airport screeners and other Homeland Security employees being asked to work, for now, without pay, the issue has largely been framed in terms of traveler convenience. If enough travelers miss planes or stand in hours-long lines, the theory goes, that may become the pressure point that breaks the logjam over funding of President Donald Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico.
This observation -- plus years of muscle-memory gridlock in Congress -- is why this longest government shutdown in American history began, in the words of veteran Republican consultant Doug Heye, with a "whimper."
It's why it has continued with a kind of weariness, and without a sense of urgency, even though Trump and his congressional allies say there is a crisis on the southern border. It's why the ongoing rhetorical battle is steeped in irony and convenient memory loss.
The same Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who accuses Democrats of opposing Trump's border wall because Trump is proposing it, is the same Republican leader who said in Barack Obama's first term that it was Republicans' goal to make Obama a one-term president.
The same Democratic leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who labeled Trump's wall "immoral" leads a party whose ranks are filled with members who have voted for border barriers in the past.
"It is a ridiculous place to have selective morality," said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
"Ridiculous" may be bandied about a lot in kitchen-table discussions of the shutdown. But as news builds on the impacts -- doctors unable to prescribe new opioid-fighting medication for lack of government oversight being among them -- Congress has seemed detached.
It's been recessed for days at a time. There is no urgency for negotiations involving McConnell who, for now, is sticking closely to Trump's position. With the shutdown entering its third week, Sen. Bob Menendez was photographed on a beach in Puerto Rico while on a junket with other Democratic lawmakers, inflaming right-wing commentators.
On Wednesday, Pelosi suggested moving back Trump's Jan. 29 State of the Union speech because of the shutdown, the clearest indication yet that neither side sees any clear path forward out of the stalemate.
Trump, in an early-morning tweet, framed the shutdown more in the context of the 2020 election than in the urgency of solving it in the moment.
"It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime," he tweeted. "They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020!"
Enhancing that point? Among the parade of Democratic senators speaking out against Trump and the border wall on the Senate floor Wednesday were members of a growing cadre of those who have already indicated they will run for president in 2020.
The talking points are firm and endlessly loop. McConnell, asked if he'd consider marshaling an override of a Trump veto on a bill to reopen the government, said: "In a situation like this where the president in my view is in the right place trying to get the right outcome … that all of us have expressed with regard to border security, of course not."
Blunt offered a novel argument: Give Trump what he wants on the wall today, and the door would be open to comprehensive immigration reform that has eluded Congress for a quarter century. Such reform, he said, could include everything from deciding what to do with people in the country illegally to the "Dreamers" who were born here to parents who came to the U.S. without documentation.
"Nobody will have more credibility than the president if he is ever in a position where he can say the border is under a level of control that the American people should expect their government to provide," Blunt said. "And when he says that, all the other discussions related to this will be more easily solved."
Some Democrats viewed the fact that 11 Republican senators -- including Missouri's Josh Hawley -- voted with them to take up their bill opposing Trump's easing sanctions on companies with ties to Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska as a sign that Trump's support in the Senate was cracking. Two GOP senators who face potentially tough re-elections in 2020, Cory Gardener of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, were also among the 11.
"Oleg Deripaska is a bad guy who still appears to be working in conjunction with Vladimir Putin," Hawley said. "Until we know for certain that Deripaska no longer has control over these entities, we need to maintain the pressure."
The vote came in the wake of a New York Times report that the FBI in 2017 probed why the president seemed to be taking actions favoring Russia, a report that prompted Trump defenders to charge that the FBI was going after the president for political reasons.
Democrats think public opinion is on their side, and give no signs of giving in. They're saying the only way this ends is if Senate Republicans convince Trump he's not going to have a chance to get a wall without opening the government first.
"If they step up and say to Sen. McConnell, 'We have a role to play in constitutional responsibility, and we want to move forward and reopen,' this conversation changes instantly," said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. "Until then, Sen. McConnell … is going to wait for his instructions from the president."

What Bruce Ohr Told the FBI

Texto completo: Everybody knew. Everybody of consequence at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department understood fully in the middle of 2016 -- as the FBI embarked on its counterintelligence probe of Donald Trump -- that it was doing so based on disinformation provided by Hillary Clinton's campaign. That's the big revelation from the transcript of the testimony Justice Department official Bruce Ohr gave Congress in August. The transcripts haven't been released, but parts were confirmed for me by congressional sources.
Mr. Ohr testified that he sat down with dossier author Christopher Steele on July 30, 2016, and received salacious information the opposition researcher had compiled on Mr. Trump. Mr. Ohr immediately took that to the FBI's then-Deputy Director Andy McCabe and lawyer Lisa Page. In August he took it to Peter Strzok, the bureau's lead investigator. In the same month, Mr. Ohr believes, he briefed senior personnel in the Justice Department's criminal division: Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bruce Swartz, lawyer Zainab Ahmad and fraud unit head Andrew Weissman. The last two now work for special counsel Robert Mueller.
More important, Mr. Ohr told this team the information came from the Clinton camp and warned that it was likely biased, certainly unproven. "When I provided [the Steele information] to the FBI, I tried to be clear that this is source information," he testified. "I don't know how reliable it is. You're going to have to check it out and be aware. These guys were hired by somebody relating to -- who's related to the Clinton campaign, and be aware."
He said he told them that Mr. Steele was "desperate that Donald Trump not get elected," and that his own wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS, which compiled the dossier. He confirmed sounding all these warnings before the FBI filed its October application for a surveillance warrant against Carter Page. We broke some of this in August, though the transcript provides new detail.
The FBI and Justice Department have gone to extraordinary lengths to muddy these details, with cover from Democrats and friendly journalists. A January 2017 memo from Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, flatly (and incorrectly) insisted "the FBI's closely-held investigative team only received Steele's reporting in mid-September." A May 2018 New York Times report repeated that claim, saying Mr. Steele's reports didn't reach the "Crossfire Hurricane team," which ran the counterintelligence investigation, until "mid-September."
This line was essential for upholding the claim that the dossier played no role in the unprecedented July 31, 2016, decision to investigate a presidential campaign. Former officials have insisted they rushed to take this dramatic step on the basis of a conversation involving a low-level campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, which took place in May, before the dossier officially came into the picture. And maybe that is the case. Yet now Mr. Ohr has testified that top personnel had dossier details around the time they opened the probe.
The Ohr testimony is also further evidence that the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in its Page warrant application. We already knew the bureau failed to inform the court it knew the dossier had come from a rival campaign. But the FISA application additionally claimed the FBI was "unaware of any derogatory information pertaining" to Mr. Steele, that he was "reliable," that his "reporting" in this case was "credible." and that the FBI only "speculates" that Mr. Steele's bosses "likely" wanted to "discredit" Mr. Trump.
Speculates? Likely? Mr. Ohr makes clear FBI and Justice officials knew from the earliest days that Mr. Steele was working for the Clinton campaign, which had an obvious desire to discredit Mr. Trump. And Mr. Ohr specifically told investigators that they had every reason to worry Mr. Steele's work product was tainted.
This testimony has two other implications. First, it further demonstrates the accuracy of the House Intelligence Committee Republicans' memo of 2018 -- which noted Mr. Ohr's role and pointed out that the FBI had not been honest about its knowledge of the dossier and failed to inform the court of Mrs. Ohr's employment at Fusion GPS. The testimony also destroys any remaining credibility of the Democratic response, in which Mr. Schiff and his colleagues claimed Mr. Ohr hadn't met with the FBI or told them anything about his wife or about Mr. Steele's bias until after the election.
Second, the testimony raises new concerns about Mr. Mueller's team. Critics have noted Mr. Weissman's donations to Mrs. Clinton and his unseemly support of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates's obstruction of Trump orders. It now turns out that senior Mueller players were central to the dossier scandal. The conflicts of interest boggle the mind.
The Ohr testimony is evidence the FBI itself knows how seriously it erred. The FBI has been hiding and twisting facts from the start.

Texto completo: Is Rihanna the Coco Chanel of the 21st century?
Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton LVMH, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, apparently thinks so. It is in the midst of a deal to back her in a fashion brand, making her the first female designer of color at the largest luxury conglomerate in the world.
The news, confirmed by sources within the group who were not authorized to speak for the company, was first reported by WWD. Neither LVMH nor Rihanna would comment, though the singer has recently been photographed on the street wearing a "mystery" pair of oversize Fenty-branded square sunglasses hinting at what may be to come.
While the details of the agreement remain unclear, it is a turning point in both fashion and fame.
The combination of Fenty and LVMH will be the clearest expression yet of how celebrity, social media and influencers have redefined the power balance between culture and consumption, changing the way brands of all kinds relate to their audience.
It is not insignificant that despite the number of well-known and respected designers currently unemployed in the fashion world, including Alber Elbaz, Stefano Pilati and Peter Copping, the dominant luxury group decided to put its money where a pop star was.
Robyn Rihanna Fenty, one of the defining musical artists of the millennium and a multi-hyphenate talent, has no formal fashion training. What she does have is a clear vision for her own image, 14 No. 1 singles on the Billboard 100 chart and more than 50 Top 40 hits, 67 million Instagram followers, and an ability to disrupt the status quo.
Now that the elite fashion world is in disarray, splintered by the rise of the street, direct communication and a growing awareness of its lack of diversity, there is little wonder that LVMH would see in Rihanna a potential way forward.
The company first became aware of the power of her base when it signed her to Kendo, its beauty subsidiary, in 2017. (Kendo produces cosmetics for Sephora, also owned by LVMH, as well as other outlets.)
The runaway success of Fenty Beauty, premised on addressing a diverse array of skin tones -- and which itself already has 6.3 million Instagram followers -- astonished the group. The line changed what consumers demanded from their makeup and was named one of Time magazine's 25 Best Inventions of 2017.
Discussions began internally at LVMH with Bernard Arnault, the chief executive, about what could happen next. Though the group had had various conversations over the years about building a brand from scratch, it had not done so since Christian Lacroix in 1987 because of the cost involved. (Lacroix was sold in 2005.) It preferred to buy already established names.
Unlike most new designers, however, Rihanna had a public profile that was as fully formed and global as any heritage brand.
She came to the attention of the fashion industry early on, singing at a Gucci fund-raiser at the United Nations in 2008, and quickly understood the power of style to magnify her messages and help her transcend the limits of the music world. In 2011, she began working with the stylist Mel Ottenberg, and an adventurous, self-aware style that encompassed looks by emerging designers as well as runway names like Lanvin and Givenchy began to emerge.
In 2014, she was named fashion icon of the year at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards, where she appeared in a sheer crystal-spangled Adam Selman dress and matching cap, a white fur wrap strategically draped around her body, setting off a so-called naked trend in red carpet dressing. The next year, at the Met Gala, she wore a giant yellow cape from the Chinese designer Guo Pei, and enshrined her skill at making an entrance.
Even though Rihanna became the face of Dior's Secret Garden scent in 2015 (making her its first black brand ambassador), she never aligned herself with a single brand; they served her purposes, rather than the other way around.
The fact that she signed a deal with Puma to be its creative director and start her own ready-to-wear brand in 2014, when the sportswear giant was still owned by Kering, an LVMH rival, and for a time worked with both groups simultaneously (an unprecedented arrangement) reflects the shift in status. Suddenly a celebrity could have the upper hand.
Last September, she introduced her lingerie collection, Fenty x Savage, at New York Fashion Week, where it made waves for including a wide range of body types and colors.
Her ambitions for her brand were perhaps matched only by those of Kanye West, who first made forays into Paris back in 2011 and interned for a while at Fendi, and whose Yeezy brand is backed by Adidas. Though Mr. West once declared his desire to design for Hermès and claimed he had been in talks with LVMH that fell through, he has stepped away from the formal catwalk in recent seasons to focus more on street wear and selling directly to consumers.
(It was Virgil Abloh, his former creative director, who ended up going to Paris. He was named men's wear designer of Louis Vuitton in March 2018.)
Other celebrities have made the move into fashion, using the red carpet as a springboard to legitimacy. But what has set them apart, whether it's Victoria Beckham or Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen at The Row, is that they have done so in part by renouncing their low culture past and humbly pledging their troth to design.
After all, industry wisdom says that to be a "real" designer, individuals must dedicate themselves to the craft. (Otherwise they are just Jessica Simpson.) Also, those designers started -- and remain -- small and independent.
By contrast, Rihanna, who starred in last summer's "Ocean's 8," appears to understand how her various platforms and outlets for expression can complement one another, and shows no interest in abandoning any of them. LVMH has presumably not asked her to.
There are still outstanding questions around just what shape her brand will take, where it will be based and how the relationship with LVMH will be structured. Even what it will be named.
But what is certain is that Rihanna's first catwalk show or extravaganza or concert, or whatever it turns out to be, will be appointment viewing far beyond the often insular fashion world. And she now has the potential to set not only style trends, but also a trend in what managers, agents, executives and kids thinking about their future imagine is possible.
Last May, as a host of the Met Gala celebrating the show "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination," the -- what to call her? designer? creative phenomenon? imagemeister? -- made her entrance in a heavily embroidered Martin Margiela bustier minidress, grand overcoat and miter, and was crowned on social media as the pope of fashion.
From the vantage point of today, it looks like a sign of things to come.

Texto completo: [Video: FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix Watch on YouTube.]
Stream Netflix's behind-the-scenes documentary on the failed Fyre Fest, and the Season 5 premiere of "Grace and Frankie."
What's Streaming
FYRE: THE GREATEST PARTY THAT NEVER HAPPENED on Netflix. The viral unraveling of Fyre Festival became a big punch lines of 2017. What was originally billed as an ultraluxury music festival in the Bahamas -- organized by the entrepreneur Billy McFarland and the rapper Ja Rule, and promoted by supermodels like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid -- in fact involved soggy tents and deconstructed cheese sandwiches upon the arrival of hundreds of festivalgoers. The documentarian Chris Smith, who directed "Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond," dives into what went wrong, and how millennial revelers were duped, by talking with festival organizers. Absent from Netflix's documentary is an interview with McFarland, who was sentenced to six years in prison for fraud in October. He gave an exclusive interview to Hulu, which released its show about the festival, "Fyre Fraud," days before the Netflix release. In his review of both films, Wesley Morris of The New York Times says, "You watch both movies in a kind of fascinated horror at how easy it was for McFarland to create a network of what appears to be unwitting co-conspirators to help him plan an experience that wound up losing $24 million."
CARMEN SANDIEGO on Netflix. Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? You can find her on Netflix in that streaming service's new animated show, voiced by Gina Rodriguez. The 10-episode series is based on the globe-trotting criminal mastermind of the late-1980s educational video games, but aims to uncover more about the title character's back story, from her time as a student at V.I.L.E. Training Academy for Thieves through to her transformation to a crook who steals valuable artifacts from other crooks. Finn Wolfhard, of "Stranger Things," stars alongside Rodriguez in the series as her trusted sidekick, Player.
GRACE AND FRANKIE on Netflix. The complete fifth season of this buddy comedy finds the title characters (played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin) continuing in the new chapters of their lives since their husbands (played by Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) revealed they are gay and left their wives for each other. If Netflix's trailer is any indication, fans can expect breaking-and-entering, New Age cults, marijuana edibles, some ill-timed nudity, a guest appearance by RuPaul and possibly even new love interests for the frenemies.
What's on TV
CHRIS DISTEFANO: SIZE 38 WAIST 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. This New York comedian, who just signed an overall deal with Comedy Central, performs standup in his hourlong special, in which he criticizes grown men in suits commuting to work on scooters, and likens his 2-year-old daughter to "a miniature baby woman."
REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER 10 p.m. on HBO. This comedian and satirist begins the 17th season of his talk show with the N.F.L. running back Marshawn Lynch and John R. Kasich, whose term as governor of Ohio ended this week.

What Bruce Ohr Told the FBI; The Justice Department official's testimony raises new doubts about the bureau's honesty.

Texto completo: Everybody knew. Everybody of consequence at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department understood fully in the middle of 2016--as the FBI embarked on its counterintelligence probe of Donald Trump--that it was doing so based on disinformation provided by Hillary Clinton's campaign. That's the big revelation from the transcript of the testimony Justice Department official Bruce Ohr gave Congress in August. The transcripts haven't been released, but parts were confirmed for me by congressional sources.
Mr. Ohr testified that he sat down with dossier author Christopher Steele on July 30, 2016, and received salacious information the opposition researcher had compiled on Mr. Trump. Mr. Ohr immediately took that to the FBI's then-Deputy Director Andy McCabe and lawyer Lisa Page. In August he took it to Peter Strzok, the bureau's lead investigator. In the same month, Mr. Ohr believes, he briefed senior personnel in the Justice Department's criminal division: Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bruce Swartz, lawyer Zainab Ahmad and fraud unit head Andrew Weissman. The last two now work for special counsel Robert Mueller.
More important, Mr. Ohr told this team the information came from the Clinton camp and warned that it was likely biased, certainly unproven. "When I provided [the Steele information] to the FBI, I tried to be clear that this is source information," he testified. "I don't know how reliable it is. You're going to have to check it out and be aware. These guys were hired by somebody relating to--who's related to the Clinton campaign, and be aware."
He said he told them that Mr. Steele was "desperate that Donald Trump not get elected," and that his own wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS, which compiled the dossier. He confirmed sounding all these warnings before the FBI filed its October application for a surveillance warrant against Carter Page. We broke some of this in August, though the transcript provides new detail.
The FBI and Justice Department have gone to extraordinary lengths to muddy these details, with cover from Democrats and friendly journalists. A January 2017 memo from Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, flatly (and incorrectly) insisted "the FBI's closely-held investigative team only received Steele's reporting in mid-September." A May 2018 New York Times report repeated that claim, saying Mr. Steele's reports didn't reach the "Crossfire Hurricane team," which ran the counterintelligence investigation, until "mid-September."
This line was essential for upholding the claim that the dossier played no role in the unprecedented July 31, 2016, decision to investigate a presidential campaign. Former officials have insisted they rushed to take this dramatic step on the basis of a conversation involving a low-level campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, which took place in May, before the dossier officially came into the picture. And maybe that is the case. Yet now Mr. Ohr has testified that top personnel had dossier details around the time they opened the probe.
The Ohr testimony is also further evidence that the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in its Page warrant application. We already knew the bureau failed to inform the court it knew the dossier had come from a rival campaign. But the FISA application additionally claimed the FBI was "unaware of any derogatory information pertaining" to Mr. Steele, that he was "reliable," that his "reporting" in this case was "credible." and that the FBI only "speculates" that Mr. Steele's bosses "likely" wanted to "discredit" Mr. Trump.
Speculates? Likely? Mr. Ohr makes clear FBI and Justice officials knew from the earliest days that Mr. Steele was working for the Clinton campaign, which had an obvious desire to discredit Mr. Trump. And Mr. Ohr specifically told investigators that they had every reason to worry Mr. Steele's work product was tainted.
This testimony has two other implications. First, it further demonstrates the accuracy of the House Intelligence Committee Republicans' memo of 2018--which noted Mr. Ohr's role and pointed out that the FBI had not been honest about its knowledge of the dossier and failed to inform the court of Mrs. Ohr's employment at Fusion GPS. The testimony also destroys any remaining credibility of the Democratic response, in which Mr. Schiff and his colleagues claimed Mr. Ohr hadn't met with the FBI or told them anything about his wife or about Mr. Steele's bias until after the election.
Second, the testimony raises new concerns about Mr. Mueller's team. Critics have noted Mr. Weissman's donations to Mrs. Clinton and his unseemly support of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates's obstruction of Trump orders. It now turns out that senior Mueller players were central to the dossier scandal. The conflicts of interest boggle the mind.
The Ohr testimony is evidence the FBI itself knows how seriously it erred. The FBI has been hiding and twisting facts from the start.

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

MANCHURIAN PRESIDENT? TRUMP-RUSSIA CONSPIRACY THEORIES UNLIKELY TO PAN OUT

Información de publicación: Pittsburgh Post - Gazette ; Pittsburgh, Pa. [Pittsburgh, Pa]. 17 Jan 2019: A-11.

Texto completo: Before we get to the question of whether the president of the United States is a Russian asset, let's consider another question: When was the last time a popular and contentious conspiracy theory turned out to be true? Not a little true, but, like, really true?
It does happen. Whittaker Chambers was right about Alger Hiss being a Soviet spy. The government really did put poison in legal alcohol during Prohibition.
But even when conspiracy theorists earn the right to say "we told you so," the actual reality often falls short of the mark. The motives of the conspirators aren't as sinister as claimed, or the plot is better explained by incompetence than malevolence, or the scope of the conspiracy itself isn't nearly as vast as suspected.
This has always been my problem with the Russian collusion theories. The British former journalist and politician Louise Mensch offers an extreme version. Among her claims: Vladimir Putin had Andrew Breitbart murdered so that former Donald Trump consigliere Steve Bannon could take over Breitbart's eponymous website; Russian intelligence planted Hillary Clinton's emails on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop; pretty much the whole of the GOP leadership is in cahoots with the Kremlin.
I have a similar problem with the Deep State theories that have bounced around the Trumpian right.
"The central premise," Infowars nutter Jerome Corsi writes, "is that President Trump is the target of a coup d'etat being undertaken by the Deep State, including the CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies that maintain a commitment to a globalist New World Order." The Deep State hates Mr. Trump, the argument goes, because his victory meant it could no longer "continue running the international drug trade while supporting the military-industrial complex in a policy of perpetual war."
Obviously, most sane people on either side of the Trumpian divide reject the cartoonish versions of their own positions. But similarities endure.
Pattern recognition is one of humanity's great evolutionary advantages. It is the foundation for trial and error, the scientific method and reason itself. But it can also mislead us. Most conspiracy theories involve motivated reasoning in which we deduce backward from a result, cherry-picking which dots to connect to fit a preexisting idea.
The people who insist that Mr. Trump colluded with Russia start with the explanation -the election was "stolen" by Russia -and then pluck facts to fit. And there are many such facts.
But, as Trump defenders and even Mr. Trump himself will quickly note, there are many contrary facts as well. His energy policies, for example, are deeply contrary to Russia's interests.
The bombshell New York Times report that the FBI opened an investigation into whether Mr. Trump was a Russian asset strikes me as simultaneously understandable and outrageous. Mr. Trump's behavior in 2016 and early 2017 was enough to overload the pattern-recognition software of anyone not already committed to Mr. Trump's innocence at all costs, particularly if you were both reading the news and receiving raw, and occasionally flawed, intelligence such as the Steele dossier.
Mr. Trump's disastrous hiring of actual Kremlin stooges and cronies, his praise of Mr. Putin, his lies about business dealings with Russia, his public beseeching of the Kremlin to release Clinton's emails, his campaign's infamous meeting at Trump Tower with an actual Russian agent, not to mention his firing of the FBI director and his comments to Russian officials in the Oval Office: One doesn't even need to resort to Deep State theories to understand why the FBI would be concerned.
But that doesn't necessarily make Mr. Trump a Manchurian president either.
He or his campaign may or may not have colluded with Russia. The Department of Justice might have cut corners to "get" him. Still, rather than elaborate conspiracies, it's far more likely that ad hoc decisions were made in response to ad hoc actions by a candidate who thought he was going to lose and, later, by a president who didn't know what he was doing.
Jeb Bush was right when he predicted in 2015 that "chaos candidate" Mr. Trump would be a "chaos president." The Atlantic just published a list, "Unthinkable: 50 Moments that Define an Improbable Presidency," and what comes through most is that Mr. Trump's glandular, impulsive and often vindictive character is the only reliable signal in the noise that is his presidency. Any theory that doesn't take this into account is not likely to pan out.

Acclaimed novelist, biographer and memoirist delved into women's creative lives

Texto completo: Francine du Plessix Gray, a writer whose novels and biographies often examined the lives of women as creative forces and as muses, and who published an acclaimed memoir that explored her complicated personal history as a Russian French child who came of age in America, died Jan. 13 at a hospital in New York. She was 88.
The cause was complications from congestive heart failure, said a son, Luke Gray.
Ms. du Plessix Gray - the French half of her name is pronounced "due play-SEE" - arrived in the United States at 10 in 1941, not knowing a word of English. Her aristocratic French father, she later learned, had been killed while fighting for the French resistance.
At first, she was sent to live in genteel poverty with relatives and family friends, listening to radio soap operas as a way to learn English. She won a scholarship to a private girls' school in Manhattan.
Soon enough, after her mother married an influential magazine designer, she grew up surrounded by high fashion, glamour and what she later recognized as the monstrous egos of her mother and stepfather, which she wrote about in a prizewinning 2005 memoir, "Them."
"I write," she told The Washington Post in 1976, "because as a child I had no one to listen to me."
After winning a prize in college and studying with poet Charles Olson, she did not begin to write in earnest until she was in her mid-30s and the mother of two. She eventually joined the staff of the New Yorker magazine and taught at Columbia, Yale and other universities.
Her novels included the best-selling "Lovers and Tyrants" (1976), which portrayed a woman's dissatisfaction with her expected social roles. Literary scholar Julian Moynahan, in a review in the New York Times, wrote that the debut novel was "crammed with unforgettably drawn characters, rich emotion and complex social portraiture."
Ms. du Plessix Gray's nonfiction books included studies of Catholic radicals, the rise of Hawaii as a sugar empire and military "fortress," and women in the Soviet Union. She wrote biographies of several French women, including 20th-century philosopher Simone Weil; Louise Colet, a writer and the muse of 19th-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert; and Madame de Staël, a writer and intellectual who lived from 1766 to 1817.
Ms. du Plessix Gray's 1998 biography of the Marquis de Sade, the 18th-century libertine from whose name the word "sadism" is derived, cast new light on his marriage to Renée-Pélagie de Montreuil and sought to elevate his reputation as a writer.
"It has all the right stuff," author Norah Vincent wrote in a review in The Post: "country estates, tasteful violence, sodomy, wigs, romance, lavish parties with catered food, conspiracies, a Peeping Tom police inspector, debauched priests, friendly peasants, rich people in puffy clothes, courtroom drama, a prison break, big historical tie-ins, an insane asylum, a predatory mother-in-law, and literary cachet to boot. Best of all, every sordid turn of the tale is true."
In many ways, though, the most dramatic stories that Ms. du Plessix Gray told grew out of her own life and, in particular, her difficult relationship with her mother, who left the Soviet Union for Paris in the 1920s.
"My flamboyant Russian-born mother," she wrote in "Them," which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for autobiography, "strode into a room, shawls spectacularly draped about her shoulders, like a tribal war goddess and moved through life with a speed and fierceness that recalled the howling wind of the steppes. Tatiana was one of the most dazzling self-inventions of her time."
Her mother went on to become a celebrated hat designer, known as Tatiana of Saks. She married a fellow Russian, Alexander Liberman, who became the art director of Vogue magazine and later the creative director of Condé Nast publications.
"They passed on a desire to shine," Ms. du Plessix Gray later wrote, but she was constantly in the shadow of their monstrous egos.
Their home on New York's Upper East Side became the center of a glittering circle of parties, which included movie stars Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo and Yul Brynner and artists Salvador Dalí, Charles Addams and Helen Frankenthaler.
Ms. du Plessix Gray studied French and Russian, piano, painting and ballet, yet she also suffered from benign neglect. She sometimes fainted at school because her mother would forget to feed her.
It was a pattern of behavior that had persisted at least since 1940. That year, Ms. du Plessix Gray's father, a diplomat who had joined the Free French movement to battle the Nazi takeover of France, was flying from Casablanca to Europe when his plane was shot down and crashed into the sea near Gibraltar.
Ms. du Plessix Gray was not told about her father's death for a year. The job was left to a governess.
" 'Why didn't you tell me?' " Ms. du Plessix Gray wrote in her memoir about confronting her mother. "I remember sobbing, repeating the word 'you,' 'why didn't you , you , you tell me?' "
Their relationship was irrevocably altered.
"The terrifying thing is that from then on Mother was seldom able to recapture my trust," Ms. du Plessix Gray wrote. "And we spent the rest of our lives - she lived on for another half century - not ever having any kind of a true emotional encounter again."
Francine du Plessix was born Sept. 25, 1930, in Warsaw, where her father was assigned to the French Embassy. She spent her early years in Paris, where, she later wrote, "my temperature was taken twice a day, my head was perpetually wrapped in some woolen muffler."
After attending the private Spence School and Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, Ms. du Plessix Gray graduated in 1952 from Barnard College in New York. She spent two summers studying with Olson at Black Mountain College in North Carolina and worked as a reporter on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift at United Press in Manhattan.
In 1957, she married artist Cleve Gray and settled in Warren, Conn., where she lived for many years. He died in 2004. Survivors include two sons, Thaddeus Gray of Lakeville, Conn., and Luke Gray of Brooklyn; and five grandchildren.
Ms. du Plessix Gray won a top writing prize in college but did not write again for years, as she increasingly began to feel "an immense void, a great powerlessness."
She pulled her prizewinning story, which a dozen years later became the opening chapter of her first novel.
"Every woman's life," she wrote in "Lovers and Tyrants," "is a series of exorcisms from the spells of different oppressors: nurses, lovers, husbands, gurus, parents, children, myths of the good life. The most tyrannical despots can be the ones who love us the most."

Texto completo: I am a 78-year old healthy woman facing a fourth surgery on my leg and am a bit depressed. Fortunately, I’ve recovered well from the previous three. Up until now I have been very active, hiking, traveling, dancing and continuing to work in my career. Several friends who have had recent surgeries tell me I need to get used to doing less and that’s just what I should expect given my age. Their negative outlook is distressing to me. Can you offer a little hope? T.S.
Dear T.S.
Yes, hope is on its way. Let’s look at the reality. We know with age we will experience changes at some point in time. Some might be disease related, others more mechanical such as a joint replacement. We may need more sleep and slow down a bit. Our immune system may not be as efficient. And then there are changes in our vision and hearing. Add to that the loss of muscle mass and flexibility. Many of these normal changes can be postponed with healthy lifestyles.
And part of that healthy lifestyle is our attitude. Here is what we know:
Becca Levy and colleagues from Yale found that those who are optimistic about their age and reject aging stereotypes can extend their life by 7.5 years. This powerful finding takes into account age, gender, wealth and self-reported health and loneliness. This research is based on a study of 660 men and women in Ohio who were followed for over 20 years. Levy found the years they gained from having a positive attitude was more than the years gained from low blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and regular exercise.
In today’s world, it can be difficult to maintain a positive view of aging as we live in a youth-centric society, particularly in Southern California. On our sunny days we are surrounded by sleek bodies in their beach, running and biking attire. In addition to our culture, preferences for youth over older age are evident in employment, movies, the advertising industry, marketing and more. But the times are slowly changing.
A recent New York Times story (January 9, 2019) headlined “Older and in Power, Unwilling to Remain Unseen” referred to four older women in positions of power: Susan Zirinksy at 66 will take over CBS News in March and is the first woman to do so. Then there is Nancy Pelosi who at 78 was re-elected to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Representative Maxine Waters at 79 will lead the Financial Services Committee. And Glenn Close at 71 beat out four younger women to win the Golden Globe award for best actress.
Yes, these all are women, which makes their position noteworthy because in general age works against women a little bit more than it does for men. You’ve heard the expression – gray hair on a man is distinguished; on a woman it’s old age. Additionally, women confront two biases: age and gender.
Let’s continue to look at reality. Those who have an illness, particularly chronic ones, may have a hard time being optimistic. Illness is scary, forcing people to deal with uncertainty, lack of control and turning themselves over to doctors. For many there is a realization their life is finite. Being positive all of the time may be unrealistic.
Older adults are resilient. They have lived through wars, divorces, losing a job, relocating, financial concerns, illness and then spring back. Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50” writes that older people feel less stress and regret; they dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. As a result, older adults are reported to be happier in their later years. Clearly difficult events continue to occur; it’s their response to the events that changes over time.
Although I am in no position to judge your current situation, it sounds as though your problem is likely fixable, given you have recovered well from your previous leg surgeries. Yet there is always uncertainty.
There is hope. Your ongoing positive outlook and resilience should serve you well. As to your friends, you might mention that everyone is a case of one – and in your case you are planning for a full recovery and resuming your active life. I feel confident that you will do everything possible to make that happen.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--A liberal prank group circulated thousands of fake editions of the Washington Post on Wednesday--with a splash headline claiming President Trump left office--a decade after collaborating on a spoof issue of the New York Times declaring the end of the Iraq war.
The paper published by the Yes Men bears a striking resemblance to the actual layout of the Washington Post, and its stories also appeared on a website mimicking the Post's site.
In a statement, the Washington Post said it was aware of the fake newspapers. "They are not Post products, and we are looking into this," the company said in a tweet.
The fake paper, dated May 1, 2019, envisions a scenario in which Mr. Trump, under pressure from an escalating uprising of angry women, flees the White House leaving little but a note, scrawled on a paper napkin, blaming "Crooked Hillary" and the "fake news media."
The Yes Men, a liberal group known for staging elaborate pranks highlighting policies it opposes, crowdfunded the project, raising $36,000 in donations on GoFundMe. The group printed 25,000 copies and was distributing them across Washington, D.C., and New York City, according to L.A. Kauffman, a writer and activist in New York, who said she co-wrote the contents of the paper with writer Onnesha Roychoudhuri.
"This paper is a vision of a reality that many of us would like to see come true," Ms. Kauffman said in an interview.
Ms. Kauffman, wearing a red scarf, stood outside the White House, handing out copies of her paper. Asked if she was concerned about any legal action from the real Post, she said she wasn't. "No, we're not worried about that," she said, then leaned in to whisper. "I think the Post probably agrees with us."
In 2008, the group also took partial credit for a fake edition of the New York Times , also dated in the future, claiming the Iraq war had come to an end. That paper bore the motto "All the News We Hope to Print," a play on the Times's "All the News That's Fit to Print."
The Washington Post is owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, and both he and the Post have been the subject of attacks by President Trump over the paper's coverage.

How to control the overwhelming fire hose of news

Texto completo: Having trouble keeping up with news that seems to be flowing out of Washington with even more fire-hose ferocity than usual? If so, you're not alone.
Almost 7 in 10 Americans (68 percent) feel worn out by the amount of news there is these days, according to a Pew Research Center poll in June.
That was notably higher than the 59 percent who reported feeling exhausted by the high amount of election coverage, compared with 39 percent who said they liked having so much news. That's not surprising, considering how much news President Donald Trump and his administration have produced, much of which they would rather not have made.
Just think, for example, of some of the recent fleeting stories that, in the pre-Trump era, would have dominated headlines for days.
In the past week, for example, The New York Times reported that, shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the bureau launched an investigation to see if the president was working on behalf of the Russian government. He angrily denounced the report and the Times ("Fake news!").
Yet, considering this was about a president who, among other questionable episodes, once cheerfully shared classified documents with Russia's ambassador during a closed-door Oval Office meeting, news of the FBI background probe left me feeling more relieved than shocked.
But that news barely sank in before The Washington Post two days later reported that Trump had gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The measures included his taking possession of his translator's notes.
Meanwhile, the longest-running government shutdown in history was closing some offices and holding up thousands of paychecks in an impasse between the president and congressional Democrats over funding of a wall on the Mexican border.
It is worth remembering that Trump had agreed to a bipartisan funding plan but then reneged after he was ridiculed by Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh and some other conservative commentators for breaking his campaign promise of a wall. Sensing his base was crumbling, Trump demanded a wall or nothing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, burned once already, refused to send anything to the Senate floor without Trump's promise to sign it, if it passed.
Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer and his fellow Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, held tight to their "no wall" position in a modified version of Napoleon Bonaparte's advice: Don't interrupt your political rival while he is destroying his own approval ratings.
But, as if the real news were not anxiety-inducing enough, Trump and his enablers held fast to his alternative version of reality. He blamed Democrats for the shutdown after promising earlier to take the blame himself. As for the questions about his Russia relations, he held to his statements that the only election conspiracy with the Russians was not his but that Hillary Clinton's campaign worked with a "deep state" of pro-Clinton FBI agents and others.
All of which reminds me of a Harvard study in 2017 that found China's government pumping almost a half-billion fake comments into Chinese social network posts over a year. The posts in fact did only one thing, the researchers said: "shower praise on all things China." Since the fake posts tended to emerge with events that might stir political unrest, the researchers reasoned that their sole purpose was to distract unhappy citizens from the temptation to organize "by stealing users' time and mental energy."
In similar fashion, the constant stream of tweets and statements from Trump that often have only a passing relationship to facts seems to be aimed at reassuring his base more than winning new converts. Pundits often speak of the "perpetual campaign." Trump is making it a reality.
What can we do about "news anxiety," which many in the psychiatric community say is a real malady, particularly in recent years? If you feel afflicted by it, mental health professionals advise limiting news or social media exposure, especially of the more sensational anxiety-inducing sort.
Psychologist Deborah Serani of Adelphi University, writing in Psychology Today, advised steering yourself away from sensational headlines and cable TV news and toward stories that offer depth, explanations and possible solutions to problems at hand. That's healthy advice. After reporting the latest scandal or atrocity, it is reassuring to know that there is a rational path out of the problem at hand, if only we can persuade our political leaders to follow it.

U.S. News: Lawmakers Formally Admonish Iowa's King

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House passed a resolution of disapproval aimed at Rep. Steve King (R., Iowa) for his comments questioning why white supremacy was deemed offensive in the U.S., which spurred lawmakers, including fellow Republicans, to encourage the nine-term congressman to find a new job.
On Tuesday, 193 Republicans joined with 231 Democrats to pass the resolution, a response to Mr. King's statements in a recent article in the New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?" Mr. King was quoted as saying. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
Mr. King said Tuesday on the House floor that he supported the resolution condemning his words, saying that his comments to the newspaper were misinterpreted, but that he probably said them. He didn't apologize.
"I'm putting up a yes on the board here because what you say is true, is right and is just," he said.
House Republicans decided on Monday night to strip Mr. King of his committee posts. He had previously sat on the Judiciary panel and Agriculture Committee, an important position for an Iowan.
The resolution Tuesday was a condemnation of racist ideology and named Mr. King and recorded his comments, but it fell short of an official censure. Rep. Bobby Rush (D., Ill.), the only no vote Tuesday, said he opposed anything less than official censure.
Mr. King also recently endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties and met with a far-right Austrian party that has been accused of trivializing the Holocaust. The latter meeting prompted Rep. Steve Stivers (R., Ohio), the head of the House GOP's campaign arm, to denounce Mr. King one week before the Nov. 6 midterm elections.
Asked why Republicans had now moved to act against Mr. King, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said he had just taken the reins of the party in January.
"I'm a brand new leader," he said, noting that he had reviewed the lawmaker's previous comments as well.
GOP Caucus Chair Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) said Mr. King should consider leaving Congress. "I think he should find another line of work," she said.
Scott Reed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's senior political strategist, on Tuesday praised Mr. King's 2020 GOP primary opponent, Randy Feenstra, a state senator. "Randy Feenstra sure looks like a pro-growth champion of cutting taxes for Main Street," Mr. Reed said.
Democrats have also introduced measures that would censure Mr. King, a more formal admonishment against the lawmaker. Those resolutions will come up on Wednesday. Democratic leadership hasn't indicated whether the measures will get a vote.
Some Democrats have expressed hesitation about a formal censure over comments made in a newspaper interview; the more formal rebuke is generally reserved for lawmakers who violate outlined House conduct.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to Launch Exploratory Committee for 2020 Presidential Bid; New York senator has positioned herself as a leading voice of Democratic dissent during the Trump presidency

Texto completo: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said Tuesday that she is forming an exploratory committee for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, seeking to mobilize women opposed to President Trump.
Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview on CBS's "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" that she would file the required paperwork on Tuesday evening but that she was launching a full campaign.
"As a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own," she said.
Her announcement, part of an 11-minute interview, was interrupted by cheers several times. Ms. Gillibrand said she would bring people together and find common ground to tackle problems like the current federal-government shutdown. She pointed to her past efforts to secure health-care funding for first responders of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The 52-year-old senator from New York has positioned herself as a leading voice of Democratic dissent during the Trump presidency, opposing Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees. She has also carved out a role as a prominent voice in the movement against sexual harassment and assault.
Her presidential bid will seek to build momentum from the wave of energy created by Democratic women who helped power the party to sweeping victories in the House during last year's midterm elections .
Ms. Gillibrand is expected to travel this weekend to Iowa, the home of the first presidential caucuses, entering a field that already includes Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. Several other Democrats are weighing campaigns.
Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown said Tuesday night that he would travel to some of the early primary states, beginning with Iowa on Jan. 31.
Ms. Gillibrand easily won re-election last year and will enter the race with more than $10.6 million left over from her Senate bid, money that can be used for her presidential campaign.
She has frequently tangled with Mr. Trump during the first two years of his administration, most notably in December 2017 when the president called her a "flunky" for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and asserted she would do "anything" for a political donation.
Ms. Gillibrand responded that Mr. Trump couldn't silence her or the millions of women who were speaking out "about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office."
She has generated criticism in some Democratic circles, however, for being the first Senate Democrat to call for former Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota to resign from office after he was accused of sexual misconduct. Her detractors said she engaged in a rush to judgment.

* Georgia House Race Shows Educated Women Are Midterm Prize (Oct. 30, 2018)
And Ms. Gillibrand is likely to face questions in the Democratic primaries about her past shifting of positions and purity on a number of policy issues.
During her single term in the U.S. House representing an upstate New York district more than a decade ago, Ms. Gillibrand supported lifting gun restrictions in the nation's capital and making English the official language of the U.S. and opposed amnesty for any immigrants in the country illegally.
She has since reversed those stances, and more recently called for the elimination of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, saying it needs to be overhauled and given a new direction.
Republicans quickly seized upon Ms. Gillibrand's record, accusing her of charting a chameleon-like path in the Senate. "If you looked up 'political opportunism' in the dictionary, Kirsten Gillibrand's photo would be next to it. From jumping on the 'abolish ICE' bandwagon to turning on the Clintons, Gillibrand always goes where the political wind blows," said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
In the Senate, Ms. Gillibrand has been a leading voice against sexual harassment and assault, including in the military and on college campuses, and has been a vocal advocate of the #MeToo movement.
She has also advocated for same-sex marriage and the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, in which military applicants were not to be asked about their sexual orientation.
Ms. Gillibrand has also displayed a populist streak at times, voting against the 2008 financial bailout as a House member in a break with many New York lawmakers backed by Wall Street.
The daughter of a prominent upstate New York political family, Ms. Gillibrand has long cited the influence of her grandmother, Polly Noonan, who was a behind-the-scenes Democratic power broker in Albany at a time when women were often on the political margins.
Ms. Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate in 2009 to fill the vacancy left by Hillary Clinton, who became President Obama's secretary of state.
The New York senator often attributes her entrance into politics to Mrs. Clinton's 2000 Senate race, but some Clinton allies have accused her of betraying the longtime patron of her political career.
Ms. Gillibrand had a public break with the Clintons in 2017, telling the New York Times that it would have been an "appropriate response" for President Bill Clinton to resign in 1998 following the revelations of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Iowa Rep. Steve King was stripped of his committee assignments by fellow Republicans for questioning what was wrong with white supremacy in the U.S., and House Democrats took steps to admonish him.
House Republican leaders made the decision Monday night. He had previously sat on the Judiciary panel and Agriculture Committee, an important position for an Iowan.
Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said that Mr. King's language has no place in the Republican Party and the decision by GOP leaders was unanimous.
Mr. King said his words were taken out of context in a newspaper interview, and argued that he was defending Western civilization and not white supremacy or nationalism.
"Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth," Mr. King said in a statement.
In an article published last week, the New York Times reported Mr. King said in an interview that he supports legal immigrants who fully assimilate to " 'the culture of America' based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe."
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?" Mr. King said in the newspaper interview. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
Two resolutions introduced separately by Democratic Reps. Bobby Rush of Illinois and Tim Ryan of Ohio would censure the lawmaker for the comments he made in the recent interview questioning why "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" are considered offensive. Mr. Rush's resolution would censure Mr. King for previous comments as well.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Democratic leadership decided Monday night to move forward with a resolution by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D., S.C.) that would formally disapprove of Mr. King's comments, but at a lower level than censure. The vote is likely Tuesday, a Democratic leadership aide said.
If one of the censure resolutions is passed by a simple majority, Mr. King would be forced to present himself at the front of the House Chamber for the pronouncement of the censure, which would be read out loud by Mrs. Pelosi.
Mr. King has a long history of criticizing immigrants and supporting white supremacists. His latest comments come as the new Democratic majority is focused on President Trump's comments about immigrants.
"It's perpetuating this division in the country that we don't need," said Mr. Ryan. "We need to start healing our country. He's done it enough times, in enough places, that I feel like it rises to the level of the House having to address it."
President Trump on Monday evening ignored questions about whether he thinks Mr. King should resign, according to a White House pool report. Earlier, he said he hadn't been following the story.
Mr. King had previously faced little pushback from his fellow Republican lawmakers and leadership. GOP presidential candidates often seek his endorsement and Mr. Trump invited Mr. King to the Oval Office early in his presidency.
Mr. King was re-elected in November to a ninth term in his toughest fight in his stronghold Republican district, after top donors dropped him and Democrats put up a formidable opponent. He has already drawn a 2020 primary challenger, state Sen. Randy Feenstra.

Some ex-backers to Sanders: Back off

Texto completo: Has the fire Berned out?
Yes, supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders are hosting house parties and signing petitions this month to show the Vermont independent that his loyal followers are still feeling the Bern and want him to run for president again in 2020.
But as Sanders weighs another campaign, some say that even as he has moved the Democratic Party ideologically — pushing issues such as Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage into the mainstream — the party has moved past him personally.
“I don't see a lot of lasting energy for Bernie," said Markos Moulitsas, the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.
The popular liberal website published an online poll last week of 35,000 users showing Sanders fifth and Senator Elizabeth Warren first among potential 2020 contenders. That was a shift from 2016, when Sanders was the consistent favorite in head-to-head matchups with Hillary Clinton.
“It's different from last time when he was the alternative to an unfortunately flawed front-runner, and there were just two of them," Moulitsas said. “Right now, the mantle of 'progressive' can be carried by any number of candidates and potential candidates," including Senator Kamala Harris and former representative Beto O'Rourke.
With Sanders, Moulitsas said, “people have mostly moved on."
Jonathan Tasini, a 2016 Sanders campaign surrogate who wrote the book “The Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America," said the senator should consider backing a nationwide slate of left-wing candidates in 2020, rather than running for the White House.
“I'm torn . . . because I was in the midst of the campaign with Bernie, but I think the people who look at that campaign need to understand the context is different," Tasini said, noting that strong progressives such as Senator Sherrod Brown are eyeing presidential campaigns.
“The danger for Bernie running as a candidate: If he loses in the nomination process, what does that do to his movement and the message he's delivering?" Tasini said. “I think there's a strong case to be argued that him running not as a candidate but leading a slate of progressives at every level will have a much more lasting impact on the country and the progressive movement."
Will Bunch, a columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News who was so electrified by Sanders in 2016 that he wrote a book about the campaign, made a similar point in his column on Sunday. Sanders should head into 2020, Bunch wrote, as “the spiritual and intellectual leader of the movement that he's built over a half-century, not as an Oval Office hopeful."
Others argue the party should nominate a younger candidate, a woman, or a person of color, given the energy that nonwhite voters and women exerted in the midterms. Sanders would be 79 years old in 2020.
“We have got to have diversity in that ticket because the Democratic Party is a diverse coalition," said Kathy Sullivan, a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire, who backed Clinton in the 2016 primary. “I don't think we can have two white guys representing us on the ticket."
Other party leaders say they are looking for the candidate who stands the best chance of defeating President Trump, not the one with the strongest progressive policy positions.
“It's important to have issues, but I think they pale in terms of what's in front of us," said Bill Shaheen, a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire who also backed Clinton in the 2016 primary. “Free college tuition means nothing to a guy like Trump. It's never going to happen. So that's the No. 1 issue: taking Trump out."
Sanders's supporters say it is precisely because of his deeply held convictions — in support of universal government-funded health care and other policies to help the working class — that the senator stands the best chance of ousting Trump.
“We don't have the luxury to afford another person who is all talk," said Nichole Mossalam, a Sanders supporter and mother of three who filed for bankruptcy due to medical debt when she was 22, and whose husband is still paying off his student loans.
“That's why I'm excited about Bernie," said Mossalam, director of the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford. “Don't give me fluff. Give me substance."
Sanders's supporters are hoping that hundreds of house parties they hosted last weekend, sponsored by a group called Organizing for Bernie, will help draw him into the race. Another Sanders-aligned group, Our Revolution, sent an e-mail to its members last week urging them to sign a petition to send a message “loud and clear: Run, Bernie, Run!"
The efforts to rally support come amid reports in The New York Times and Politico from some women who say they faced sexual harassment and sexism in Sanders's 2016 campaign. Sanders has apologized twice, calling the mistreatment “absolutely unacceptable." On Wednesday, he plans to meet with the former staffers to address their concerns, the Times reported.
Mark Longabaugh, a senior Sanders adviser, said Sanders remains a vital figure in the progressive movement, closer to the activist base than the Democratic elite.
He pointed out that the senator is backing the “Green New Deal," an ambitious plan to combat climate change that has galvanized progressive activists, thanks in part to support from Sanders's star acolyte, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
He also pointed out that Sanders remains very popular with millennials and won that demographic by huge margins in the 2016 primary.
“I still think he has his fingers on the pulse of the party and the future of the party, because that's literally the future of the party," Longabaugh said.
And many of Sanders's followers remain as dedicated as ever.
Shannon O'Toole, a 59-year-old disabled veteran from Lee, N.H., said she is just waiting for Sanders to announce, as are her friends in the military who serve overseas.
She already has an ample collection of Sanders gear ready to go, including T-shirts, bumper stickers, pins, and a yellow vest on which she wrote “Bernie 2020," in a nod to the Yellow Vest protests against the French government.
“The world wants Bernie," she said. “The world is waiting."

Alexander: Still an uphill battle for Chargers in L.A.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I. — On the field, as long as you discount Sunday’s boat race against the Patriots, the 2018 season was an unqualified success for the Chargers. A 12-4 regular season, one playoff win, and a core of young, talented players suggest a bright future.
On the streets and in the boardrooms and living rooms of L.A., do people care?
The overnight TV ratings for Sunday’s Divisional Round playoff game in Foxborough were down slightly nationally (19.2), despite huge numbers in the Boston market. In L.A., the game drew a 17.2 rating. In San Diego it drew a 29.7, underlining the fact that it remains the home of the only group of football fans who still truly care about this franchise.
(I mean, hating is caring, right?)
This is, as we have been constantly told, a long-term play for the Chargers in Los Angeles. Playing in the recently renamed 28,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson was meant to transition the franchise into the market while building an audience and selling seat licenses for their tenancy in the stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood.
We are now two years into this adventure and there’s no going back. Dean Spanos told the New York Times last week, “There’s no doubt we are the Los Angeles Chargers. Los Angeles is our home.”
They’ve sold some seat licenses for the StanleyDome, shrewdly offering them for as little as $100 with the idea of ultimately positioning themselves as the people’s team.
Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests few people are buying it. How often do you see people wearing Chargers gear in public, for instance, compared to the number of people wearing Rams gear?
L.A. is an incredibly competitive sports market, and it takes time to create a niche. The Chargers had the misfortune of coming in a year after the Rams and their pre-existing history and legacy in L.A. They may still be digging out from the 0-4 start in their inaugural L.A. season, in terms of public perception.
Yes, winning does matter. But the Chargers’ success came the same season that the Rams were just a little bit hotter. And with the Chargers done, guess who has the L.A. football stage all to itself this week?
Whether the Spanos family likes it or not, this is still perceived in many quarters as a franchise that belongs to, and in, San Diego. Even now, two years in, the Lyft driver in Baltimore, the radio/podcast commentator in Cleveland, the occasional referee announcing a penalty and observers throughout the country still refer to the team as “San Diego.”
(Then again, during the wild card game in Baltimore last week referee Clete Blakeman slipped and declared that “San Francisco is charged with its first timeout” after an unsuccessful Chargers challenge. Yeah, we know, all those California teams are interchangeable.)
Consider this, going back to TV ratings: For much of the season, the Chargers’ L.A. ratings were in single digits and significantly trailed those in its former home. The Baltimore game last Sunday drew an 18.0 rating and 43 share in Los Angeles, a significant improvement … but in San Diego, split between those who still love the team and those who despise Spanos, the game drew a 30.7 rating and 60 share. Sunday against the Patriots was pretty much more of the same.
The ratings figure is deceptive, of course, because of the difference between a point in No. 29 market San Diego (10,028 homes, as measured by Nielsen) and No. 2 L.A. (53,186). Translated, 914,799 households in L.A. had the Patriots-Chargers game on, compared to 297,832 in San Diego.
Numbers can be crunched. Passion is harder to measure.
The San Diego Union-Tribune sent a reporter to New England this past weekend. San Diego TV people show up at home games and midweek availability in Costa Mesa. And there seems to be a constant debate in San Diego over how much that city’s media should pay attention to the city’s former team. Meanwhile, in L.A. it is one team among many and simply fighting for attention.
That shouldn’t be surprising at all. When this team played in San Diego, I had always maintained that with its low national profile, the only people who really, really cared about the Chargers resided in San Diego County, plus parts of Orange and Riverside counties. Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

Taking stock of Lancaster County’s business climate as 2019 begins

Resumen: In 2018, one measure of Lancaster's strength has been the number of national publications that have highlighted aspects of Lancaster’s economy and quality of life, from The New York Times to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance to Forbes. Another measure is the considerable volume and diversity of businesses that are experiencing notable growth, as evidenced by physical expansions, capital investments and new product development. For EDC, the majority of our work is behind the scenes, providing support to businesses here that are hiring local residents, reinvesting into facilities and equipment and contributing significant tax dollars to local municipalities and the County.

Texto completo: For many businesses, the beginning of a new year is a good time to take stock of accomplishments over the past 12 months. That could mean looking at plans for the year as well as opportunities, assets and threats that may impact future business goals and targets.
At the Economic Development Company of Lancaster County, which prioritizes the retention and expansion of existing businesses, this period of reflection encompasses both the state of the community as well as the health of our organization.
Measuring success
Lancaster County continues to be the envy of many, from regional partners and businesses to those much further afield. In 2018, one measure of Lancaster's strength has been the number of national publications that have highlighted aspects of Lancaster’s economy and quality of life, from The New York Times to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance to Forbes.
Another measure is the considerable volume and diversity of businesses that are experiencing notable growth, as evidenced by physical expansions, capital investments and new product development.
A third way to gauge Lancaster is by more traditional metrics such as its unemployment rate (hovering in 2018 around 3.5 percent and among the lowest in Pennsylvania) or vacancy rates, which across most sectors are precipitously low.
Conservative yet entrepreneurial
It is the underlying, foundational factors driving the success of 2018 and the potential for 2019 that are the real hallmark of Lancaster, and they also show up in the organizational DNA of EDC and of many community benefit organizations that serve this community.
These factors are increasingly recognized by peer communities seeking to replicate Lancaster’s “magic dust.” One key factor is the combination of a conservative financial approach balanced with an entrepreneurial mindset.
EDC sees this repeatedly in the businesses that we serve. For example, consider our agricultural community as it navigates challenging times, in part, through strengthened off-farm business efforts; or the inventive small to midsize manufacturers building a dizzying array of products locally that are deployed globally.
This sweet spot is one reason why Lancaster, which has historically navigated economic upturns and downturns without wild swings, remains well-positioned for continued growth in 2019.
This approach also has guided EDC, with a laser focus on doing our core business, diversifying revenues to limit any downward exposure (such as a government shutdown that has impacted SBA lending) and investing prudently in activities that add value to the community, such as with the advancement of the Center for Regional Analysis.
Engaged businesses
Another factor is bringing experienced business acumen to help guide Lancaster’s future. In this community, employees at all levels —from C-suite to business development to back office — find it both rewarding for themselves and meaningful for their businesses to be “at the table” helping to drive Lancaster’s progress.
For EDC, business engagement shows up in several ways, from the considerable annual financial support that businesses provide to ridiculously strong leadership and wisdom through service on our boards and committees.
The same holds true for several of our core partners at the Lancaster Chamber and the Lancaster City Alliance, who are also significantly business supported. Our organizations benefit from business knowledge, while the business people learn more about the complexity of key issues shaping the community.
Humble approach
And perhaps the last factor that has served Lancaster well and positions it favorably for 2019 is the culture of being humble.
It may be particularly acute given today’s broader environment, but as a whole, Lancaster takes its success in stride and continues to identify opportunities to make improvements instead of taking progress for granted.
For EDC, the majority of our work is behind the scenes, providing support to businesses here that are hiring local residents, reinvesting into facilities and equipment and contributing significant tax dollars to local municipalities and the County.
Based on our current pipeline of projects, the outlook for 2019 remains strong.

Texto completo: Almost two years into the Trump presidency even left-leaning pundits are starting to acknowledge that reports of the demise of our republic were greatly exaggerated. In related news, a revealing interview with the new top investigator in the U.S. House shows what Democrats really think of Russian collusion claims.
As for the once-popular media theory that Mr. Trump represented a unique and grave threat to constitutional governance, columnist Doyle McManus writes in the Los Angeles Times that "the specter of an autocratic president running roughshod over democratic institutions has ebbed." It's not clear how one measures the ebbing of a specter, but Mr. McManus takes a crack:
Not long ago, the never-Trump half of the nation was gripped by fear of an authoritarian takeover; books with titles like "Fascism: A Warning" became bestsellers. But as Trump begins what may be the second half of a one-term presidency, democracy looks newly resilient.
I recently asked Harvard University's Steven Levitsky for a report card. In "How Democracies Die," another bestseller, Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt warned that Trumpism looked much like the one-man populism that turned Hungary and Turkey into autocracies.
Levitsky says he still worries about the long-term corrosion of democratic norms but his worst fears haven't been realized. "American democracy isn't dying," he told me. "We're not turning into Hungary."
Mr. McManus correctly notes that in two years of the Trump presidency, "the institutional bulwarks of democracy have held." Mr. McManus doesn't speak for all of his colleagues in the U.S. media, but at least some of them understand how hard it is to maintain the authoritarian thesis as Trump opponents continue to thrive. A Journal editorial in November noted :
"Make No Mistake, the Midterm Elections Were a Democratic Victory," chortled the New Yorker. Apparently American democracy works--at least when Democrats win.
Yet it's worth recalling that this wasn't the view two years ago after Donald Trump's unexpected victory. Then the cry was all about a stolen election, Vladimir Putin's collusion with Mr. Trump, the need to rewrite the Constitution to banish the Electoral College, and the looming threat of an authoritarian coup. "If You're Not Scared About Fascism in the US, You Should Be," declared a headline in the New York Times as recently as mid-October this year.
So what happened to the coup? Did Mr. Trump call it off? It turns out the U.S. had a relatively normal midterm election in which the party not holding the White House gained a substantial number of seats.
To be clear, this newspaper never bought into the coup thesis. Two days before Mr. Trump's election in 2016, a Journal editorial reviewed the pros and cons of Mr. Trump's candidacy and noted :
The least convincing Never Trump argument is that he would rampage through government as an authoritarian. That ignores the checks and balances in Washington that constrain GOP Presidents in particular. If Mr. Trump wins, the media would awaken from their Obama-era slumbers and dog his Administration with a vengeance. The permanent bureaucracy would resist his political appointees, working with the media to build public opposition.
The authoritarian thesis became harder to sustain as Mr. Trump set about reducing the power of the central government via reform of tax and regulatory policies and the appointment of judges committed to interpreting the law as written. But to this day many of his opponents in politics and the press cling to the idea that eventually they will discover evidence that Mr. Trump colluded with Russia to rig the 2016 election.
They may have to wait a while longer. The CBS News program "60 Minutes" ran a segment this weekend featuring an interview with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), chairman of the House oversight committee and the new principal congressional investigator of the Trump administration. Rep. Cummings said that one problem is that there is "so much" to investigate across the federal government and limited time to do so. The program reported that Mr. Cummings wants to pursue a range of issues including the "high cost of prescription drugs" and "private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members."
Such issues are evergreens for congressional overseers, and further indication that U.S. democracy is operating as usual. To put it another way, would any oversight chairman waste time on such issues if he really believed the sitting President had collaborated with a hostile foreign power to rig his election?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--President Trump rejected the notion that there was anything inappropriate in his interactions with Moscow, responding to heightened scrutiny of his interactions with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.
"I never worked for Russia," Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Monday morning for a speech in New Orleans.
House Democrats said Sunday they would explore allegations Mr. Trump has sought to limit documentation of his meetings with Mr. Putin. That came after
the Washington Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported Saturday that there are no classified or other detailed records of Mr. Trump's meetings with Mr. Putin. In addition, the New York Times reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a counterintelligence probe into Mr. Trump in 2017, concerned that the president's abrupt firing of James Comey as FBI director indicated he was working on behalf of Russian interests.
In an interview with Fox News over the weekend, Mr. Trump didn't directly answer whether he has worked for Russia, saying, "It's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."
A reporter asked the same question Monday, and Mr. Trump said directly that he never worked for Russia. He added: "not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question. It's a whole big fat hoax."
The Comey firing, in May 2017, led shortly after to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller , whose long-running probe into whether members of the Trump campaign helped Russia interfere with the 2016 election--and whether Mr. Trump has obstructed justice--has put several close Trump associates in legal jeopardy.
Mr. Trump on Monday also again blasted Mr. Comey, who told lawmakers a month after he was fired that Mr. Trump had been pressuring him in a bid to secure his loyalty. The president responded: "So what happened with the FBI, I have done a great service for our country when I fired James Comey because he was a bad cop, and he was a dirty cop, and he lied. He really lied."
Mr. Comey declined to comment.
Mr. Trump on Saturday said the report that he took extraordinary steps to keep his discussions with Mr. Putin secret was ridiculous.
"I had a conversation like every president does," Mr. Trump told Fox News. "You sit with the president of various countries. I do it with all countries. I'm not keeping anything under wraps, I couldn't care less."
Who's Who in the Mueller Probe
Seven people have pleaded guilty in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election:
* Paul Manafort: The former Trump campaign manager was convicted of tax and bank fraud in part related to his political consulting work in Ukraine. He then pleaded guilty to a related charge, and to conspiring to influence the testimony of a potential witness.
* Richard Gates: The former Trump campaign aide and Manafort associate pleaded guilty to charges related to his work with Mr. Manafort.
* Michael Cohen: The former Trump lawyer pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Donald Trump's involvement during the campaign in efforts to build a tower in Moscow. Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to charges separate from the Mueller probe, including campaign-finance violations related to payments to two women who alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump.
* Michael Flynn: The former White House national security adviser pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about contacts with the Russian ambassador ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration.
* George Papadopoulos: The former Trump campaign adviser pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about contacts with a Russia-linked professor.
* Alex van der Zwaan: The Dutch lawyer pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his contact with Mr. Gates related to work for the Ukrainian government.
* Richard Pinedo: Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in connection with the alleged Russian plot to interfere in the U.S. election.
Read a full list of those indicted or guilty in the Mueller probe.
In that same interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump was asked if he would release details of his conversation with Mr. Putin during a summit meeting in Helsinki last year, in which he took bipartisan criticism for questioning the U.S. intelligence conclusion that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election. "I would. I don't care," Mr. Trump said.
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said Monday that no decision has been made on subpoenaing the interpreter at the July meeting in Helsinki, but he planned to discuss the matter with Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.).
"We are not going to do this cavalierly, we are going to put our heads together and get at the truth, and we are going to work together," Mr. Engel said on CNN. "What we are not going to do is sit back and do nothing. We are going to try and get to the bottom of this."
Interpreter groups warned against subpoenaing Mr. Trump's translator when the possibility was first raised after the July meeting, stating that such a move would violate the industry's code of ethics. At the time, Democrats were calling for Marina Gross, the longtime State Department employee reported to have translated the meeting, to testify as a matter of national security.
In his comments Monday, Mr. Trump didn't agree to release any transcripts or notes when asked by reporters.
"I just don't know anything about it," Mr. Trump said. "I read it this morning. It's a lot of fake news."
In a break with precedent, Mr. Trump's White House doesn't keep records of every meeting between the president and foreign leaders, a former national-security official said, adding that was an effort to let the president build relationships with foreign counterparts.
Democrats on Sunday said that the news reports underscore the importance of the Mueller probe.
"It suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion," Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said on "Fox News Sunday."

THESE ARE THE BEST OF TIMES PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD HAVE BEEN LIVING LONGER AND LIVING BETTER

Texto completo: The world is, as everyone knows, going to hell, but there's still the nervous thrill of waiting to see precisely which dark force will take us down. Will the economy collapse first, the ice sheets melt first, or chaos and war envelop us first?
Here's my antidote to the gloom: Let me make the case that we are living in the best times in human history.
Each day on average last year, another 295,000 people around the world gained access to electricity for the first time, according to Max Roser of Oxford University and his Our World in Data website. Every day, another 305,000 were able to access clean drinking water for the first time. And each day an additional 620,000 people were able to get online for the first time.
Never before has such a large portion of humanity been literate, enjoyed a middle-class cushion, lived such long lives, had access to family planning or been confident that their children would survive. Let's hit pause on our fears and frustrations and share a nanosecond of celebration at this backdrop of progress.
On a dirt road in rural Angola a few years ago, I met a woman named Delfina Fernandes who had lost 10 children out of 15; she had endured perhaps the greatest blow any parent can, and she had suffered it 10 times.
Yet such child deaths are becoming far less common. Only about 4 percent of children worldwide now die by the age of 5. That's still horrifying, but it's down from 19 percent in 1960 and 7 percent in 2003.
Indeed, children today in Mexico or Brazil are less likely to die by the age of 5 than American children were as recently as 1970.
The big news that won't make a headline and won't appear on television is that 15,000 children died around the world in the last 24 hours. But in the 1990s, it was 30,000 kids dying each day.
Perhaps it seems Pollyannish or tasteless to trumpet progress at a time when there is so much butchery, misrule and threat hanging over us. But I cover the butchery and misrule every other day of the year, and I do this annual column about progress to try to place those tragedies in perspective.
One reason for this column is that journalism is supposed to inform people about the world, and it turns out that most Americans (and citizens of other countries, too) are spectacularly misinformed.
For example, 9 out of 10 Americans say in polls that global poverty is worsening or staying the same, when in fact the most important trend in the world is arguably a huge reduction in poverty. Until about the 1950s, a majority of humans had always lived in "extreme poverty," defined as less than about $2 a person per day. When I was a university student in the early 1980s, 44 percent of the world's population lived in extreme poverty.
Now, fewer than 10 percent of the world's population lives in extreme poverty, as adjusted for inflation.
Likewise, Americans estimate that 35 percent of the world's children have been vaccinated. In fact, 86 percent of all 1-year-olds have been vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.
"Everyone seems to get the world devastatingly wrong," Hans Rosling, a brilliant scholar of international health, wrote in "Factfulness," published in 2018, after his death. "Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more frightening, more violent and more hopeless - in short, more dramatic - than it really is."
I suspect that this misperception reflects in part how we in journalism cover news. We cover wars, massacres and famines but are less focused on progress.
In the last year, I've covered atrocities against the Rohingya in Myanmar, starvation in Yemen, climate change in Bangladesh, refugees and child marriage at home, and some of the world's worst poverty, in the Central African Republic. All those stories deserve more attention, not less. But I never wrote columns or newsletters about three nations that registered astounding progress against authoritarianism and poor governance in 2018, Armenia, Ethiopia and Malaysia.
It is of course true that there are huge challenges ahead. The gains against global poverty and disease seem to be slowing, and climate change is an enormous threat to poor nations in particular. And the United States is an outlier, where life expectancy is falling, not rising as in most of the world.
So there's plenty to fret about. But a failure to acknowledge global progress can leave people feeling hopeless and ready to give up. In fact, the gains should show us what is possible and spur greater efforts to improve opportunity worldwide.
Every other day of the year, go ahead and gnash your teeth about President Donald Trump or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but take a break today (just for a nanosecond!) to recognize that arguably the most important thing in the world now is not Trumpian bombast. Rather, it may be the way the world's poorest and most desperate inhabitants are enjoying improved literacy and well-being, leading to a day when no mom will again lose 10 children.

We Don't Have to Like 'Best Sellers'

Texto completo: In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more of this series here.
Here, the New York Times best-seller lists staff answers frequently asked questions about how the lists are put together, and how they're scrutinized for accuracy and impartiality.
How many best-seller lists does The New York Times have?
We currently have 11 weekly lists and five monthly lists. This includes our new monthly audiobook fiction and audiobook nonfiction lists. The number of lists, as well as the number of books on those lists and the kinds of books tracked, has changed over the years to help reflect trends in the bookselling industry and to best inform our readers about what is being read now.
The best-seller lists reflect sales from the previous week's Sunday-to-Saturday time period. They are posted online on Wednesday nights for our digital subscribers and many of them appear in the Sunday Book Review 11 days later for our print readers.
The lists are divided into categories -- such as fiction; nonfiction; advice, miscellaneous and how to; and children's -- so our readers can see how a book is selling relative to other books in that category.
The number of categories and rankings make the lists more useful to our readers, and also make competition between authors more fair. This way a picture book, for example, isn't going against a cookbook or an adult fiction title.
Are there other credible best-seller lists that compete with The Times's lists?
Our lists represent sales from tens of thousands of brick-and-mortar stores of all sizes, as well as from a large number of online bookselling vendors, in order to best represent what is selling across the United States.
Other lists may favor certain segments of the bookselling universe. Indiebound's lists cover what is happening at independent bookstores, while USA Today has a single list that covers a sample of larger retail stores.
How do authors get on The New York Times best-seller lists? Do their books have to be sold at certain stores?
The New York Times best-seller lists are very competitive, which is what gives them the cachet they have within the book industry and with the public.
Our lists reflect the reporting from our confidential panel of tens of thousands of retailers. We do not reveal those sources, in order to circumvent potential pressure on the booksellers and to prevent people from trying to game their way onto the lists.
A number of variables go into whether a book will rank on a given week. Weeks where there are blockbuster debuts in multiple categories will be different from quieter weeks.
Do the books have to be published by certain publishing houses? Can they be self-published?
Because we receive data across the spectrum of booksellers on a national level, the lists tend to skew toward books from the large publishing houses, but small press and self-published books make appearances on our lists with regularity.
Do the books have to have been reviewed in The New York Times?
Books that get ranked may or may not get reviewed by the Book Review and vice versa. Our best-seller lists and the editorial decisions of The Times's book editors and critics are entirely independent.
This means our lists are not a judgment of literary merit made by the editors of the best-seller lists, who remain impartial to the results. These are best-seller lists, not best-reviewed lists.
How can a book be listed at No. 1 on another list but not be at the top of The Times's list?
Other organizations might use different reporting stores and reporting periods. Some use Monday-to-Sunday periods. (A single day can create a huge difference in data.)
And some might not apply the same rigorous standards for inclusion: Part data scientists, part investigative journalists, our best-seller list editors scrutinize sales reports with a practiced eye to uncovering manipulation.
How do The Times's ranking methods ensure objectivity?
The best-sellers desk is staffed by three full-time editors who work independently from our news, opinion and culture desks; from the Book Review and the books desk; and from our advertising department.
Our nonfiction lists feature books from authors across ideological and political spectrums. In the last year, politicians and commentators who identify as conservative have performed as well as, if not better than, liberal ones on our lists.
Trends depend on publishing schedules and what is happening in the cultural zeitgeist.
The authors with the most weeks on our hardcover nonfiction list in the last 10 years are Bill O'Reilly (438 weeks, 330 of them as a co-author), Laura Hillenbrand (203 weeks), Malcolm Gladwell (200 weeks), Chelsea Handler (147 weeks, 18 of them as a co-author) and Michael Lewis (119 weeks).
How often and why does The Times remove books from its lists?
This happens only rarely. Since the lists began in 1931, it has occurred only a few times.
Twice technical issues were involved. In another instance a title was removed from our middle-grade hardcover list when a preponderance of reporting stores anonymously conveyed that the sales fell far outside our standards for inclusion.
We feel strongly that the best-seller lists should reflect the sale of books to individual end users. In other words, they should be sales to actual readers.
Strategic bulk or other purchases made by an author or an entity working on behalf of an author with the intention of skewing the lists happen with frequency. We receive anonymous tips about authors who have purchased their own books at stores across the country in attempts to make their sales seem organic. Those books were then shipped to climate-controlled storage units to be potentially resold in smaller numbers elsewhere, given away free to friends and associates, or ground into pulp.
While these practices are not illegal, they do not accurately reflect public interest in a book. They are also unfair to other authors who may not have hundreds of thousands of dollars at their disposal to do this or who earn their rankings based on actual sales.

Texto completo: President Trump's National Security Council asked the Pentagon to provide the White House with military options to strike Iran last year, generating concern at the Pentagon and State Department, current and former U.S. officials said.
The request, which hasn't been previously reported, came after militants fired three mortars into Baghdad's sprawling diplomatic quarter, home to the U.S. Embassy, on a warm night in early September. The shells--launched by a group aligned with Iran--landed in an open lot and harmed no one.
But they triggered unusual alarm in Washington, where Mr. Trump's national security team led by John Bolton conducted a series of meetings to discuss a forceful U.S. response, including what many saw as the unusual request for options to strike Iran.
"It definitely rattled people," a former senior U.S. administration official said of the request. "People were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran."
The Pentagon complied with the NSC's request to develop options for striking Iran, the officials said. But it isn't clear if the proposals were provided to the White House, whether Mr. Trump knew of the request or whether serious plans for a U.S. strike against Iran took shape at that time.
Garrett Marquis, an NSC spokesman, said the body "coordinates policy and provides the president with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats."
"We continue to review the status of our personnel following attempted attacks on our embassy in Baghdad and our Basra consulate, and we will consider a full range of options to preserve their safety and our interests," he said.
Mr. Bolton's request reflects the administration's more confrontational approach toward Tehran , one he has pushed since taking up the post last April .
As national security adviser, Mr. Bolton is charged with providing a range of diplomatic, military and economic advice to the president.
Former U.S. officials said it was unnerving that the NSC asked for far-reaching military options to strike Iran in response to attacks that caused little damage and no injuries.
Last year, then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis argued against strikes that might hit Russian and Iranian forces when Mr. Trump and his national security team were looking at ways to punish President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for a chemical-weapons attack , people familiar with the debate said. Mr. Mattis, who resigned in December amid a dispute with Mr. Trump over the president's national security decisions, pushed for a more modest response that Mr. Trump eventually embraced.
In talks with other administration officials, Mr. Bolton has made it clear he personally supports regime change in Iran, a position he championed before joining Mr. Trump's administration, people familiar with the discussions said.
As a think-tank scholar and Fox News commentator, Mr. Bolton repeatedly urged the U.S. to attack Iran, including in a 2015 New York Times op-ed titled, "To stop Iran's bomb, bomb Iran."
After taking the White House post, Mr. Bolton joined forces with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to develop a more aggressive policy aimed at weakening the government in Tehran. Mr. Bolton has said his job is to implement the president's agenda, which doesn't include regime change in Tehran. The State Department declined to comment.
Mr. Bolton worked last year to quickly pull the U.S. out of former President Obama's nuclear-containment deal with the country and totighten economic sanctions on Tehran, moves eagerly sought by Mr. Trump. In a September speech, Mr. Bolton warned Tehran that there would be "hell to pay" if Iran threatened the U.S. or its allies.
Mr. Bolton and his deputy at the time, Mira Ricardel, were pressing for new ways to confront Iran militarily.
The Sept. 6 mortar attack in Baghdad generated little news coverage. The city's Green Zone has been a frequent target for insurgents since the U.S. invasion in 2003. A Shiite militia group aligned with Iran eventually claimed responsibility for the attack.
Two days later, amid anti-Iranian protests in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, unknown militants fired three rockets that hit relatively close to the U.S. consulate, but caused no serious damage.
No one claimed responsibility for the second attack, but White House officials decided they needed to send a clear message to Iran.

Alongside the requests in regards to Iran, the NSC asked the Pentagon to provide the White House with options to respond with strikes in Iraq and Syria as well, people familiar with the talks said.
In one meeting, Ms. Ricardel described the attacks in Iraq as "an act of war" and said the U.S. had to respond decisively, a person familiar with the meeting said.
Ms. Ricardel, who was forced out of her job in November after a feud with first lady Melania Trump , didn't respond to requests for comment. Current and former U.S. officials said there have been discussions about her taking a new job at the Pentagon.
As the administration discussed the U.S. response last fall, the White House issued a two-paragraph statement on Sept. 11 that seemed to warn of a possible military strike.
"The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities," the White House said.
Two weeks later, Mr. Pompeo made it clear the U.S. was willing to target Iran for the actions of its allies in Iraq.
"Iran will be held accountable for those incidents," he said in a Sept. 21 CNN interview .
"Even militarily?" asked CNN's Elise Labott.
"They're going to be held accountable," Mr. Pompeo replied. "If they're responsible for the arming and training of these militias, we're going to go to the source."
Mr. Trump's administration has kept up the public threats. This month, Mr. Pompeo again warned Tehran when it announced plans to launch two satellites into space , a move the Trump administration said would help the country advance its missile-launching abilities.
"We won't stand by while the regime threatens international security," Mr. Pompeo said in a tweet on Jan. 3.
During a trip to Israel this month, Mr. Bolton suggested that Mr. Trump was willing to strike Iran if he thought Tehran was close to developing a nuclear weapon.
"The president looks at all his options constantly," Mr. Bolton said in an interview with talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt that aired on Friday. "On a subject of this seriousness, this is something we coordinate very closely with Israel on, but for reasons I'm sure you can understand, we have to keep our cards close to the vest."

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Sunday condemned recent comments from U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, questioning why white supremacy is seen as offensive. Cruz did not rule out lending future support to King, a central figure in his 2016 presidential campaign.
"What Steve King said was stupid," Cruz said during an interview on NBC's "Face the Nation." "It was stupid, it was hurtful, it was wrong and he needs to stop it."
Asked if he would back King in the future, Cruz replied that he will "urge everyone to stand for principles that matter" and shifted the topic to how he spoke out against a recent effort to oust a Tarrant County GOP official because he is Muslim. Cruz was among several top Texas Republicans who condemned the effort, which failed in a 139-49 vote Thursday.
King has long made incendiary comments about immigration and the country's evolving demographics. His most recent remarks came in an interview published earlier this week in The New York Times in which he asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”
Other Republicans have criticized King's latest comments, but Cruz has a close relationship with King, who served as a national co-chair of Cruz's 2016 bid.
King's rhetoric last came under such scrutiny in the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in November, which coincided with the closing days of Cruz's re-election race against then-U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-El Paso. At the time, Cruz issued a general lament about political division in the country but did not directly criticize King.

More TSA agents refuse to work during shutdown

Texto completo: Headnote AIRPORT ANXIETY
The partial shutdown of the federal government is starting to affect air travel as a growing number of security agents are refusing to work for no pay.
So far, however, the impact on air travelers has been relatively limited with no significant disruptions. But airport workers and travelers are concerned that conditions will worsen if the impasse continues, throwing travel into turmoil.
At least one airport, Miami International Airport, will start closing one terminal early each day, starting Saturday, because of a shortage of screeners employed by the Transportation Security Administration, said Greg Chin, an airport spokesman.
Chin said agents had been calling in sick at double the normal rate this week, leaving their supervisors worried that they will not have enough agents to operate all of the airport's 11 security checkpoints.
The nation's 51,000 airport security agents are among the federal employees who have been ordered to work through the partial shutdown, which began Dec. 22. On Friday, they missed their first paycheck since it started, a lapse that their union leaders feared would cause more of them to stop showing up for work or even to quit their jobs.
Hydrick Thomas, president of the TSA Council of the American Federation of Government Employees, said this week that "extreme financial hardship" had driven some of his members to resign and many others to consider doing so.
The agents earn about $35,000 a year, on average, union officials said. "We have people that work from paycheck to paycheck, and there's quite a few of them," said Vincent R. Castellano, national vice president for the union's second district, which encompasses the Northeast.
Near Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, a church-sponsored food pantry has been delivering food to TSA workers, said Jessica Whichard, a spokeswoman for the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina. Whichard said the White Oak Foundation had requested more food than usual from the food bank so that it could distribute some of it to the airport workers.
The workers, many of them still in their TSA uniforms after finishing their shifts, showed up to collect food at a makeshift pantry the foundation set up in a parking lot near the airport, said Kathleen Lee, director of services for the foundation. She said the foundation would continue offering food to federal employees twice a week at the White Oak Missionary Baptist Church in Cary, North Carolina, for "as long as necessary."
Lee said the workers were not sheepish about accepting the handouts. She said one of them told her, "If I'm getting free groceries, then I can pay my light bill."
Despite the shutdown and the hardships it is causing security agents, federal officials said that passengers had not faced any major problems navigating security checkpoints. Following the holiday rush, the air travel industry is entering a period where the number of people flying is generally lower than during other parts of the year.
But if the shutdown persists, the worry among industry officials is that agents will face pressure to find paying jobs elsewhere, leading to staffing shortages. Security officers at airports around the country were already expressing increasing anxiety about their financial plight.
"It is getting harder to come every day and know that you're not getting paid, but it's my job, and I knew when I started this job that this was potentially going to happen," said a 37-yearold woman who is a screener at Los Angeles International Airport. "So I'm going to come in, but if there is any other reason that I have to call out, I'm not going to hesitate to do it."
Like many other screeners interviewed for this article, she declined to be identified because she said she had been warned against talking to journalists.
"It's difficult to budget things like food, or knowing which bills to pay, when you simply don't know when you'll have money again," said a 29-yearold man who works for the TSA at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.
He said that he had contacted his banks, mortgage company and other creditors, but none of them had a program to help in his situation. The Department of Homeland Security distributed letters for its employees to show to landlords, explaining that they "are unlikely to be able to pay for their housing for the foreseeable future," but they have been of little assistance, he said.
So he was resigned to having to run up the balances on his credit cards and pay interest on the debt, he said, adding that in the meantime, he was looking around the house for things that he could sell quickly on eBay.
At O'Hare, he said, "Our policies and screening procedures aren't being done any less thorough, but it's likely they may take longer the more officers we become short."
Federal officials have downplayed the effects of the partial shutdown on travelers. Michael Bilello, a spokesman for the TSA, has been using Twitter to report how long it is taking to get through security checkpoints. On Friday morning, he said that the maximum wait time at Newark Liberty International on Thursday was 36 minutes, but at Boston Logan International it was just 7 minutes.
David P. Pekoske, the administrator of the TSA, said in a statement Thursday: "I am connected to the field & fully understand the strain our employees & their families are experiencing. Yet, due to the commitment & resolve of the TSA work force, the traveling public has confidently traveled securely around the clock as high-level of travel volume indicate."
No other major airports have announced plans to take the sort of action that Miami International has planned. Chin said that the airport would close Concourse G at 1 p.m. on Saturday through Monday and divert the flights that would normally leave from there to another concourse. He described that shift as a precaution "just in case the number of call-outs increases."
A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three major airports that serve New York City, said those airports had continued to operate normally during the shutdown.
One transportation security officer on a meal break in Terminal 2 at Kennedy International Airport this week said that his co-workers were still showing up to work and quietly enduring the uncertainty.
"It's like you feel that silent tension that's going to build up later on," said the officer, a two-year veteran who lives in Queens and takes care of his parents. He said he could manage without a paycheck for now, but a shutdown lasting months or longer would be another matter.
"If it continues for a year, then the question is can you survive?" he said. Eventually, he suggested, he and his co-workers might start having to choose between food and shelter - and probably would cut back on food first.
"Can I do the job without nutrition? Somebody has to answer that," he said. "If 52,000 people have to work without nourishment, can the job get done?"
He said health care was another worry because a lot of the agents take prescription medications. "How long can we go forward when it actually affects your fundamental needs?" he said.
For now, the plan was to keep showing up. "I'm not taking my vacation next week," he said. "I have to come, which I will, because I'm under oath, so I'm going to do that."

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Trump Didn't Deploy Note Takers at Putin Meeting; President tried to limit leaks about the session and many top administration officials never were briefed on it

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--President Trump didn't have official note takers present in his introductory meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and many top administration officials never were briefed on the discussion, according to several officials familiar with the matter.
When Messrs. Trump and Putin first met in Germany in 2017, it was the Russians who asked to have a note taker present, according to those people. Telling aides that he wanted to reduce the chance for leaks, Mr. Trump in an unconventional move allowed only then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to be present at the session, and instead had him take notes with the intention of relaying the details to relevant officials afterward, they said.
The president went to "extraordinary lengths" to keep his discussions with Mr. Putin from leaking, according to one person familiar with the planning, including preventing any details from the meeting from circulating widely within the government.
"It was very unusual," this person said.
Many top administration officials never were briefed on the Putin meeting, nor were the leaders of many allied countries, who traditionally would have been given some indication of what was discussed, the officials said.
Unlike most prior administrations, Mr. Trump's White House doesn't keep records of every meeting between the president and a foreign leader, a former national security official said, adding it was an effort to let the president build relationships with foreign counterparts. "He does not use traditional diplomatic techniques," the official said.
"There aren't records of his meetings like you'd expect," said one foreign official, adding the administration also cut back on phone call transcripts since his conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia leaked out early in his presidency.
Mr. Trump said claims that he took extraordinary steps to keep his discussions with Mr. Putin secret were ridiculous.
"I had a conversation like every president does," Mr. Trump said in an interview Saturday on Fox News. "You sit with the president of various countries. I do it with all countries. I'm not keeping anything under wraps, I couldn't care less."
The Washington Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported Saturday that there are no classified or other detailed records of Mr. Trump's meetings with Mr. Putin. The White House described the report as "outrageously inaccurate."
House Democrats said they would explore whether Mr. Trump sought to limit documentation of the meetings, in what could be one of their first actions to probe the president since they took control of the House this month.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said in a statement. "We will be holding hearings on the mysteries swirling around Trump's bizarre relationship with Putin."
A former Trump White House official said the National Security Council kept "rigorous" notes of the president's phone calls with foreign leaders, but that records were at times more "bare bones" for private, in-person sessions that weren't formal bilateral discussions.
The former official said Mr. Trump was nervous that if too many officials had access to records the contents might leak out. Those concerns drove Mr. Trump at the G-20 session in Hamburg to have only Mr. Tillerson present at the meeting with Mr. Putin, the official said.
After one meeting with a foreign leader, the former official said, the president turned to the interpreter in the room and asked for the interpreter's notes, which the former official believed meant Mr. Trump was concerned that the interpreter would disseminate them.
The request seemed unusual because interpreters don't typically brief administration officials on the contents of a meeting, the former official said.
Brian McKeon, former principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy and former chief counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it wasn't unusual for presidents to hold restricted-access meetings with foreign leaders, "but there would always be a note taker in the room."
The translator "is busy in those meetings--they can't be taking notes," he said.
Mr. McKeon added that those notes typically would be circulated among the NSC staff, as well as to the secretaries of State, Defense, the Director of National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency director.
After Mr. Trump's second meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki last year, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said, "I don't know what happened in that meeting."
"If he had asked me how that ought to be conducted, I would have suggested a different way, but that's not my role," Mr. Coats said at the Aspen Security Forum. "It is what it is."
Mr. Trump's decision to exclude officials from meetings with Mr. Putin has drawn particular scrutiny as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, which Moscow has denied doing.
The president, who has publicly expressed skepticism about U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Moscow interfered in the election, has privately told Mr. Putin that he believes his denials, the former official said.
Democrats on Sunday said the reports underscore the importance of Mr. Mueller's work. "It suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion," Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said on "Fox News Sunday."
The Washington Post's report on the lack of note takers came on the heels of a New York Times article reporting that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Trump after he fired former Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," Mr. Trump said of the New York Times report in the Fox News interview.
Members of the Trump administration and Republicans dismissed the report.
"The notion that President Trump is a threat to American national security is absolutely ludicrous," said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on CBS's "Face the Nation."
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump ally who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday" that he would ask the current FBI director if the agency had opened an investigation into Mr. Trump and ways he may have benefited Russia.
"How could the FBI do that?" he said. "What kind of checks and balances are there?"
A counterintelligence probe by the FBI into Mr. Trump "tells me a lot about the people running the FBI," he said.

Texto completo: CLEVELAND - Above, the ceiling was done up in silver, beige and blue like frosting on a wedding cake. Below, at the lip of the stage, a tall man in a black suit and white bow tie leaned forward with a tip.
"This is going to be something," said Mark Jackobs, one of the Cleveland Orchestra's viola players. "This is a freight train."
Jackobs, who has played in the room for 25 years, knew just how the sound would flood Severance Hall, one of North America's most admired classical music venues.
This was my first concert in the hall, so I had plenty of questions. But before I could ask more, the lights dimmed in the 1,920-seat auditorium, and we rushed to our seats.
Conductor Franz Welser-Most raised his baton. A hundred musicians, including Jackobs, snapped to attention. The train, also known as Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, was leaving the station.
Inside the hall
When the orchestra's leaders launched the campaign to build Severance Hall in 1928, Cleveland was on a roll. As America built skyscrapers, Cleveland's steel mills were shipping vast tonnage on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River.
The city's population was about to hit 900,000. The orchestra, founded in 1918, had already played New York, made its recording debut and started on the path to worldwide acclaim.
Since then, Cleveland has shrunk, suffered and been smirked at like few other American cities. But it also has reinvented itself and begun to bloom again.
As I explored the auditorium and roamed the city for four days in September, I was amazed that in the middle of a city so changed, the orchestra and its hall have never stopped doing what they set out to do.
A day before I heard the orchestra, Andria Hoy, its archivist, gave me a tour of the hall, which didn't quicken my pulse right away. In fact, if architecture is frozen music, Severance Hall's Georgian neoclassical exterior is "Pomp and Circumstance" at 23 beats a minute.
But inside, it's "Rhapsody in Blue" meets "King Tut." Once you step into the grand foyer, you're swallowed by a mashup of art deco swoops and Egyptian Revival details.
It was 1928, Hoy told me, when philanthropists John and Elisabeth Severance pledged $1 million for a project to be designed by Walker & Weeks, a local architecture firm. Then Elisabeth died at the family winter home in California, followed by the stock market crash in late 1929.
Yet John didn't hesitate. Construction began a month after the crash, and he took every opportunity to stamp the concert hall with Elisabeth's personality, ultimately spending more than $2 million in Great Depression dollars, about $29 million today. It opened in 1931.
The intricate, lacelike aluminum leaf pattern on the ceiling is said to match Elisabeth's wedding dress.
"He really turned this building into a memorial to her, which is where a lot of the opulence comes from," Hoy told me.
The grand foyer, a double-height oval space outfitted with marble from Italy and Indiana, is surrounded by two dozen columns, a series of Egyptian Revival murals and two sets of stately stairs.
As for Cleveland's orchestra, the musicians never relinquished the reputation that spread globally under the exacting George Szell, music director from 1946 to 1970.
New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles may be bigger cities, but in January last year a New York Times headline proclaimed that "At 100, the Cleveland Orchestra May (Quietly) Be America's Best."
(A later article in October noted that the orchestra had fired its concertmaster and principal trombonist for sexual misconduct and harassment.)
Bela Bartok, Leonard Bernstein, Benny Goodman, Wynton Marsalis, Yehudi Menuhin, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Mstislav Rostropovich - all have stood on the Severance Hall stage.
It remains the orchestra's home for about 100 performances a year in fall, winter and spring.
(Concerts move to the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls in the summer.)
The hall also hosts graduations, weddings, Cleveland Pops Orchestra concerts and other events.
The legacy
On concert night, I arrived early so I could start with a meal at Severance, the venue's fine-dining restaurant. Solicitous service, tasty sea bass special. Good omens.
The music began with Prokofiev's Symphony No. 1, a sprightly, sunny work despite being composed while Russia and the rest of Europe were a mess. I'm no music critic, but it sounded seamless and precise to me, and the rest of the room seemed to agree.
The hall was about two-thirds occupied, the crowd mostly 50 and older and white, although one or two sections were dominated by students. Eager to woo young and varied listeners, the orchestra offers free admission to those 18 and younger for many performances.
The next piece was Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 2 from 1931 - a challenging, dense work featuring ferocious guest pianist Yefim Bronfman. In one passage he seemed to conjure the sound of mist rising from a pond. In another, Bronfman played with such force and speed that his whole body shuddered.
After intermission was the sonic assault that Jackobs had warned me about, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 3, composed in 1928.
Before beginning, Welser-Most addressed the audience, suggesting that Sigmund Freud must have influenced this piece. He also asked us "to listen for not just the melody but what is happening underneath."
Then, from the first note: shrieking strings and brass, booming timpani, curious three-note clusters ascending and descending - a beginning as dark and alarming as the night's first Prokofiev piece had been bright and frisky.
From there, things calmed a bit, with plenty of delicate passages. I could relax and look around a little. But this is a symphony that began its life as an opera about demonic possession, so chaos was bound to return.
At the close of the fourth movement, Prokofiev dispatched us with a pair of booming, dissonant full-orchestra chords. Utter doom, under a twinkling aluminum ceiling.
At Cleveland's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the amps are turned to 11 to get effects like this. In Severance Hall, they do it without amplifiers, in a suit and bow tie, just as they have for 87 years.

Texto completo: President Trump's National Security Council asked the Pentagon to provide the White House with military options to strike Iran last year, generating concern at the Pentagon and State Department, current and former U.S. officials said.
The request, which hasn't been previously reported, came after militants fired three mortars into Baghdad's sprawling diplomatic quarter, home to the U.S. Embassy, on a warm night in early September. The shells--launched by a group aligned with Iran--landed in an open lot and harmed no one.
But they triggered unusual alarm in Washington, where Mr. Trump's national security team led by John Bolton conducted a series of meetings to discuss a forceful American response, including what many saw as the unusual request for options to strike Iran.
"It definitely rattled people," a former senior U.S. administration official said of the request. "People were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran."
The Pentagon complied with the National Security Council's request to develop options for striking Iran, the officials said. But it isn't clear if the proposals were provided to the White House, whether Mr. Trump knew of the request or whether serious plans for a U.S. strike against Iran took shape at that time.
Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the body "coordinates policy and provides the president with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats."
"We continue to review the status of our personnel following attempted attacks on our embassy in Baghdad and our Basra consulate, and we will consider a full range of options to preserve their safety and our interests," he said.
Mr. Bolton's request reflects the administration's more confrontational approach toward Tehran , one that he has pushed since taking up the post last April .
As national security adviser, Mr. Bolton is charged with providing a range of diplomatic, military and economic advice to the president.
Former U.S. officials said it was unnerving that the National Security Council asked for far-reaching military options to strike Iran in response to attacks that caused little damage and no injuries.
Last year, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis argued against strikes that might hit Russian and Iranian forces when Mr. Trump and his national security team were looking at ways to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a chemical-weapons attack , according to people familiar with the debate. Mr. Mattis, who resigned last month amid a dispute with Mr. Trump over the president's national security decisions, pushed for a more modest response that Mr. Trump eventually embraced.
In talks with other administration officials, Mr. Bolton has made it clear that he personally supports regime change in Iran, a position he aggressively championed before joining the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the discussions.
As a think-tank scholar and Fox News commentator, Mr. Bolton repeatedly urged the U.S. to attack Iran, including in a 2015 New York Times op-ed titled, "To stop Iran's bomb, bomb Iran."
After taking the White House post, Mr. Bolton joined forces with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to develop a more aggressive policy aimed at weakening the government in Tehran. Mr. Bolton has said that his job is to implement the president's agenda, which doesn't include regime change in Tehran. The State Department declined to comment.
Mr. Bolton worked last year to quickly pull the U.S. out of former President Barack Obama's nuclear-containment deal with the country and totighten economic sanctions on Tehran, moves eagerly sought by Mr. Trump. In a September speech, Mr. Bolton warned Tehran that there would be "hell to pay" if Iran threatened America or its allies.
Mr. Bolton and his deputy at the time, Mira Ricardel, were pressing for new ways to confront Iran militarily.
The Sept. 6 mortar attack in Baghdad generated little news coverage. The city's Green Zone has been a frequent target for insurgents since the U.S. invasion in 2003. A Shiite militia group aligned with Iran eventually claimed responsibility for the attack.
Two days later, amid anti-Iranian protests in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, unknown militants fired three rockets that hit relatively close to the American consulate, but caused no serious damage.
No one claimed responsibility for the second attack, but White House officials decided they needed to send a clear message to Iran.

* Trump Withdraws U.S. From Iran Accord (May 8)

Alongside the requests in regards to Iran, the National Security Council asked the Pentagon to provide the White House with options to respond with strikes in Iraq and Syria as well, according to people familiar with the talks.
In one meeting, Ms. Ricardel described the attacks in Iraq as "an act of war" and said the U.S. had to respond decisively, according to one person familiar with the meeting.
Ms. Ricardel, who was forced out of her job in November after a feud with first lady Melania Trump , didn't respond to requests for comment. Current and former U.S. officials said there have been discussions about her taking a new job at the Pentagon.
As the administration discussed the U.S. response last fall, the White House issued a two-paragraph statement on Sept. 11 that seemed to warn of a possible military strike.
"The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities," the White House said.
Two weeks later, Mr. Pompeo made it clear the U.S. was willing to target Iran for the actions of its allies in Iraq.
"Iran will be held accountable for those incidents," he said in a Sept. 21 CNN interview .
"Even militarily?" asked CNN's Elise Labott.
"They're going to be held accountable," Mr. Pompeo replied. "If they're responsible for the arming and training of these militias, we're going to go to the source."
The Trump administration has kept up the public threats. Earlier this month, Mr. Pompeo again warned Tehran when it announced plans to launch two satellites into space , a move the Trump administration said would help the country advance its missile-launching abilities.
"We won't stand by while the regime threatens international security," Mr. Pompeo said in a tweet on Jan. 3.
During a trip to Israel earlier this month, Mr. Bolton suggested that Mr. Trump was willing to strike Iran if he thought Tehran was close to developing a nuclear weapon.
"The president looks at all his options constantly," Mr. Bolton said in an interview with talk-radio host Hugh Hewitt that aired on Friday. "On a subject of this seriousness, this is something we coordinate very closely with Israel on, but for reasons I'm sure you can understand, we have to keep our cards close to the vest."

Gun deaths soar to record 'American carnage'

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U.S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
Even with Democrats taking power in the House, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3.4 per 100,000.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Texto completo: Report: FBI probed if Trump secretly worked for Russia
WASHINGTON -- Law enforcement officials became so concerned by President Donald Trump's behavior in the days after he fired FBI Director James Comey that they began investigating whether he had been working for Russia against U.S. interests, The New York Times reported Friday.
The report cites unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
The inquiry forced counterintelligence investigators to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security, and they also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.
The Times reports that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but didn't launch an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive and important probe, according to the sources. But Trump's behavior in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing, specifically two instances in which he seemed to tie Comey's ousting to the Russia investigation, helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the investigation.
Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing. The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russians. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.

Mexico deploys 4,000 troops, copters against pipeline theft
MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Friday he has ordered helicopters and 4,000 troops to guard the nation's pipelines and fuel depots in an offensive against massive fuel theft.
The helicopters are watching for organized gangs that drill illegal taps into underground ducts carrying gasoline and diesel. Lopez Obrador ordered key pipelines shut down after thefts soared recently.
Long lines continued at gas stations in Mexico City and outlying states Friday as tanker trucks struggled to supply fuel normally delivered through pipelines.
Most Mexicans understood the need to crack down on $3 billion per year in fuel thefts, but patience was wearing thin.
"We are asking for people's understanding," Lopez Obrador said.

Rookie California cop is shot, killed in ambush at crash scene
DAVIS, Calif. -- A 22-year-old police officer on the job only a few weeks was shot and killed by a suspect who opened fire as she was investigating a three-car crash, authorities in Northern California said.
The suspect, who has not been identified, was later found dead inside a home with a self-inflicted gunshot wound following a short standoff with officers, the Davis Police Department said Friday.
Police said Officer Natalie Corona was ambushed by a gunman on a bicycle shot after responding alone to a traffic accident Thursday evening in the city west of Sacramento.
One of the drivers in the crash, Christian Pascual, 25, told the Sacramento Bee that the shooter appeared to have been a bystander who fired from behind him.

Woman sought in death of Nev. manicurist found in Ariz.
LAS VEGAS -- A 21-year-old woman sought for almost two weeks by authorities in Las Vegas after allegedly skipping out on a $35 manicure and using a stolen car to run over and kill a manicurist has been arrested in Arizona, police said Friday.
Krystal Whipple was taken into custody in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, authorities said.
Las Vegas police said prosecutors will seek her extradition to Las Vegas where Whipple was sought in a warrant on murder and robbery charges in the killing of Ngoc Nguyen, 51.
Police said Whipple tried to pay for her manicure with a fraudulent credit card Dec. 29 before telling Nguyen that she was going to her car to get cash, then drove away, killing Nguyen as she stood in front of of the vehicle as it accelerated.

In Europe, 21 deaths deemed weather-related
BELGRADE, Serbia -- Heavy snow paralyzed much of Europe for yet another day, cutting off mountain villages, sparking avalanches like one that crashed into a Swiss hotel and killing at least four more people Friday.
Workers at the Hotel Saentis in eastern Switzerland spent Friday shoveling out hip-deep snow after a 330-yard-wide avalanche smashed through the hotel's windows Thursday.
In all, at least 21 weather-related deaths have been reported in Europe in the last 10 days.
The Bulgarian Red Cross said two snowboarders were killed in an avalanche in southwest Bulgaria's Pirin Mountains.
A snowplow driver died Friday in Germany after his vehicle toppled into an icy river, while an electrical worker in Albania suffered a fatal heart attack while repairing damaged power lines.

Court says Ginsburg has no cancer remaining
WASHINGTON -- Tests revealed that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has no additional cancer following her surgery in December, and no further treatment is needed, the Supreme Court announced Friday.
"Justice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments," court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement.
Ginsburg had surgery Dec. 21 for two malignant nodules in her left lung, the 85-year-old justice's third bout with cancer.
This week, for the first time since she joined the court in 1993, she missed a round of oral arguments. Ginsburg is the oldest member of the court, and the longest-serving member of the court's four-member liberal wing.

Saudi woman: Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, who said she was abused by her family and feared for her life if deported back home to Saudi Arabia, left Thailand on Friday night for Canada, which has granted her asylum, officials said.
She had fled her family while visiting Kuwait and flew to Bangkok.

Hat in the ring: Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has announced that she is running for president in 2020.
Gabbard, a 37-year-old Iraq War veteran and the first Hindu elected to Congress, said in a CNN interview slated to air Saturday night that she will formally announce her candidacy next week.

Texto completo: Where did she go?
Dave, Denbigh: I have a question for you to investigate. Last night on Channel 43, the WAVY news team was signing off at 7:30 p.m., and Ashley Baylor, who was their substitute meteorologist, announced she was leaving the station. I didn't catch the story. She must have told the other news anchors there what she was doing, where she was going - I know she's had a baby. But I'm curious to know where she's going.
Editor: Reporter Mike Holtzclaw reached out to her, and here is her response: "New England is my home and I miss it, so when this opportunity came up in Connecticut, I took it. I'm staying within our company, just transferring to a different station. WTNH is a great station in the Hartford market - I already have family and friends up there so I'm looking forward to it. Not to mention, it's a lot closer to my husband's base, so he won't have to make the dreaded nine-hour drive up there every month for drill. I will be keeping my Facebook and Twitter pages, so everyone in HRVA can keep up with what's going on with me."
A question of why?
* Why on earth would Dominion Energy buy out a South Carolina utility drowning in debt with the nuclear construction abandoned? Can DP reporters explain? Thanks! We rely on DP for thoughtful and relentless investigation.
Editor: I took your question to reporter Dave Ress, and here's what he said: "We probably need to do some more reporting to really understand, but what's striking here is that Dominion is acquiring a company that has a monopoly on delivering electricity and natural gas to 1.6 million customers. It's a business, and it is probably significant that in announcing the deal, Dominion CEO Tom Farrell emphasized the geographic close fit of Dominion's gas transmission business in North Carolina, as well as its plans for the Atlantic coast pipeline, its electric utility. It may also be significant that Dominion has made a successful business of taking over other companies' faltering nuclear plants.
About the shutdown
*I wanted to compliment your coverage of the effects of this government shutdown on local people who work for these agencies. In today's paper, I don't see any reference to NASA. It's a significant agency in this area. This subject bears continuing coverage. Keep up the good work.
Editor: Thanks for sharing your thoughts. As you probably saw, today's front-page story addresses the NASA Langley angle. We're going to cover different aspects of the shutdown as it continues. Keep reading and feel free to suggest topics I can pass along to the news team.
Stocks listings
Robert: I have a request/suggestion to be included in business section. 30 Dow Jones industrial stocks used to be listed on a regular basis. Please put them back into the paper.
Editor: We switched providers for that information, and unfortunately are no longer able to include that same listing in our daily roundup. Most of those 30 stocks do appear elsewhere in other listings on the page. However, we realize they don't always all get in every day, as the other listings (for most active stocks and largest companies) are dynamic, varying from day to day.
Missing the best-sellers
Warren: The bestseller list has been missing from the paper the last two Sundays. What happened?
Editor: There were notes included on the page for the missing best-sellers list during those days. We couldn't get it because the wire service didn't get it in time for our early deadlines during the holidays, but it's returned this week.
Crossword puzzle change
Ron: Well, seems the DP has done it again - a crossword puzzle vendor change. What was wrong with the Timothy E. Parker standard; i.e. solvable? The new ones are terrible. Sunday two weeks ago I thought it was due to your cyber-attack. Let's go back to Timothy E. Parker. These are ridiculous!
David: Please bring back Timothy Parker's crosswords puzzles. They are the best, most challenging I have seen and the highlight of my daily routine. Why did they go away?
Editor: We have not changed vendors. It's a decision by the syndicate, not ours. Here's what was shared with us: "David Steinberg is the new editor of 'Universal Crossword Weekly' and has replaced former editor Tim Parker, who is no longer associated with this crossword. David Steinberg published his first crossword puzzle in The New York Times when he was just 14 years old, making him the second-youngest constructor to be published under Will Shortz's editorship. At the age of 15, David became the crossword editor of the Orange County Register's 24 affiliated newspapers. To date, David has had hundreds of puzzles published in the Times and other markets (Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, Daily Celebrity Crossword, The Crosswords Club, The American Values Club Crossword, BuzzFeed and The Jerusalem Post) ..."

Texto completo: Hatred of women is all around us — or so you'd conclude from a lot of recent commentary. Just in the first days of this year, we've seen claims that misogyny is behind questions about whether Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is too “unlikable" to run for president and that a “culture of misogyny" infested the 2016 presidential campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Search for such phrases as “America hates women," and you'll get 7,000 hits — with thousands more for “our culture hates women" and similar phrases.
But does woman-hating really pervade our lives, or is the term “misogyny" getting bandied about too casually?
Genuine misogyny exists in today's world, including in America. It thrives on bottom-of-the-barrel Internet boards populated by “pick-up artists," “Red Pillers" who believe they understand women's true biological nature, and militant “incels" — the self-described involuntary celibates embittered by their own inability to find sexual partners. The far right teems with critics of feminism whose screeds often devolve into general woman-bashing; one leading alt-right ideologue, the psychologist and podcaster Stefan Molyneux, rants against women's right to vote and blames women's choices for most of the world's evils.
Sometimes, shockingly misogynistic rhetoric seeps into more mainstream conservative press as well. During last year's controversy over sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a female blogger for PJ Media asserted that “most women lie and scheme."
But, like any concept, the term “misogyny" is cheapened by overuse. When it's expanded to cover everything from debates over whether a specific female politician would make a good presidential candidate to a wide range of complex cultural attitudes, it's rendered nearly meaningless — and that makes it harder to point out the real thing.
It's hardly misogynistic to raise concerns about Warren's apparent likability deficit as indicated by iffy favorability ratings; nor is there any real evidence that those ratings are due to her gender. Voters in Massachusetts elected her to the Senate twice, but a majority told pollsters last fall that she shouldn't run for president. Contrary to the claims of the offended, it's not just women in politics who are branded unlikable. Just ask Mitt Romney, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts and the new GOP senator from Utah, whose lack of likability was frequently mentioned during the 2012 election.
The alleged culture of misogyny in the Sanders campaign has to do with several female ex-staffers claiming that sexual harassment was not properly addressed, partly because the operation was often chaotic. One woman claims a manager was dismissive when she complained about a male campaign official touching her hair. If true — the former manager denies it — this is certainly wrong.But surely not all insensitive behavior amounts to misogyny. An act can be unwanted, inappropriate, even ignorantly sexist, without being hateful.
Or take another recent example of frivolous use of the M-word: A New York Times op-ed titled “The Special Misogyny Reserved for Mothers." Author Hillary Frank, who launched a podcast on parenting in 2010 as a new mom, finds it galling that it took a while to get big outlets interested because the topic was seen as too niche (though she admits “motherhood has become a boom market" since). She also recounts the time an inebriated producer at a hotel bar during a conference called her “the baby lady" and made a crude advance, only to be promptly restrained by people nearby — an incident that somehow translates into general disrespect for mothers.
Sometimes, claims about ubiquitous misogyny are even less specific. How exactly does America “hate women"? To be sure, negative stereotypes of women exist; but stereotyping affects both sexes, and a 1991 study by Purdue University psychologist Alice Eagly found that overall “women are evaluated . . . more favorably than men."
Cornell University philosophy professor Kate Manne, whose 2017 book “Down, Girl: The Logic of Misogyny" has been hailed as groundbreaking, claims men's woes get disproportionate sympathy — “himpathy," she calls it. But evidence for such bias is scarce. Generally, research shows the opposite: Women in distress are more likely to get sympathy and help than men, and violent crimes against women are punished more severely. Meanwhile, tasks involving a high risk of injury and death are still treated as men's work. (If women accounted for 90 percent of workplace fatalities, this would be seen as a misogynist atrocity.)
Manne's concept of misogyny includes blatant woman-hating such as the rage of Elliot Rodger, the 2013 California spree killer who left a chilling screed about his rejection by women. But it also encompasses “systemic" bias that punishes women who violate patriarchal norms — a definition vague enough that almost anything can fit. And some of Manne's evidence is shaky. She pounces on the finding that female professors are more likely to be called “fake" in student evaluations on RateMyProfessor.com. Yet the word is vanishingly rare, occurring about 10 times per million words for women and four times for men. By comparison, “useless," applied more often to male profs, averages about 400 per million.
In recent years, the term “misogyny" has been applied to everything from sexualization of women in entertainment (even though male objectification is catching up) to Internet trolling of women (even though men are targeted at least as much) to defending the presumption of innocence for men accused of sexual violence. And to Donald Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton, widely seen as misogyny triumphant.
Yet gender dynamics are intensely complicated. One can loathe Trump and still think that most of his voters — including a majority of white women — were not in thrall to misogyny. Many dismissed his comments about grabbing women's privates as mere swagger, or were impressed by his show of contrition and his record of promoting women in business. Notably, when a gender-flipped short version of the Trump-Clinton debates — preserving the body language and expressions — was staged a few months after the election, audiences loathed Male Clinton and loved Female Trump.
To confront misogyny, let us define the term precisely: as hostility or contempt toward women as a group, or as an attack on an individual woman in a way that unambiguously targets her gender.
It's not all criticism that might conceivably have a “gendered" subtext. It's not sexual interest in women, even inappropriately expressed. It's not disagreement with aspects of feminism. We must distinguish between someone who says that false accusations of rape are a real problem, and someone who says most women are scheming liars.
In today's cultural free-for-all, it's important to keep lost young men (and others) from being enticed by Internet woman-haters like Molyneux and the Red Pillers. But suggesting that the rest of the culture is not that different is the wrong way to counter the real misogynists in our midst.

Texto completo: Last year, for the first time, we sent one intrepid traveler, Jada Yuan, to all 52 destinations on our Places to Go list. This year, we decided to do it again. Once again, we got applicants from around the world and from a variety of backgrounds ( meet some of them here ). After weeks of assessing them, we settled on a handful of finalists. From that group, we chose Sebastian Modak, one of our finalists from last year, and a journalist with an impressive background and résumé. Just weeks before he sets off to his first destination -- Puerto Rico, which took the No. 1 spot on the list this year -- we asked him some questions about himself and the trip ahead.
So, how does it feel to be the 52 Places Traveler for 2019?
In a word: surreal. It's a lot of emotions at once -- gratitude, excitement, anxiety -- but mostly I'm still finding it hard to wrap my head around it concretely. I'm starting to think the sheer scope of what I'm doing won't hit me until I make landfall in the first destination and start reporting. Luckily, data scientists at the travel aggregator Kayak have helped us sketch out an itinerary for the year in advance -- as they did last year for Jada -- so I have some sense of what the structure of my year looks like. That said, this trip wouldn't be nearly as interesting if I knew exactly what to expect, right? I'm ready to embrace all the uncertainty that comes with an opportunity like this and see where it takes me.
Have you been following Jada Yuan, our 2018 Traveler? Anything in particular you've picked up from her dispatches?
I've read every one. It's been a real pleasure following along and I know I've got some big, well-worn shoes to fill. My favorite moments from Jada's dispatches were the interactions that, on the surface, may seem everyday, but in actuality tell much bigger stories about a place: a night out in Kigali, a meal in La Paz, a haphazardly assembled trip-planning committee in China built out of nothing but the kindness of strangers. Those stories get at the heart of why we travel. I'm hoping to bring the same openness and down-for-anything attitude that led Jada to those moments.
In a couple of ways, you have a background uniquely suited to this gig.
I do feel like I've been working toward doing something like this my whole life. I was born in the United States to a Colombian mother and an Indian father, but we left for Hong Kong when I was 2 years old and continued to move every few years. My brothers and I didn't really grow up with the concept of "home," because we understood every place was temporary. It made travel the only real constant in our lives. January marks five years in New York City, though, and that puts it in a joint first-place spot for the longest I've stayed anywhere -- tied with Indonesia and India.
For me, travel is all about immersing yourself in the unfamiliar, and embracing the feeling of humility that comes with that: There's always something to learn from someone else, from somewhere else. That's what made me choose a career in multimedia storytelling. I was a Fulbright-mtvU fellow in Botswana, where I spent a year documenting the local hip-hop scene. I was a producer on an MTV series that looked at the role of the arts in protest movements around the world. Most recently, I was an editor and then a staff writer at Condé Nast Traveler, where I was often sent on assignment to find and report stories that resonate with a global and globally curious audience. I think the thread that connects all of these experiences is an insatiable sense of wonder at the world around me.
You'll be starting your journey in Puerto Rico, which took the No. 1 spot on the list. Have you been?
I haven't been, but I've wanted to -- in part thanks to some of the island's cultural exports that show up in New York, where I live: heaping portions of arroz con gandules and the sounds of hip-hop duo Calle 13, for example. I can't think of a better time to finally make the trip. Working in travel journalism, I've seen and reported on how natural disasters can devastate economies, not just in their immediate aftermaths, but for months or years.
As has been the case in the wake of Hurricane Maria, tourism is often one of the hardest hit sectors. But I've heard about how resilient the people of Puerto Rico have been in the face of not only hurricanes, but economic and political crises as well. I can't wait to try the island's coffee at its source and follow the sound of rolling bomba drums to a countryside dance party. But, most of all, I'm looking forward to meeting the people whose perseverance has made Puerto Rico the No. 1 slot this year, just a year and a half after tragedy.
Is there a destination on the list you are most looking forward to?
There's nothing I'm not excited about, but I think Iran takes the top spot. More than any other place on the list, or even in the world, Iran is somewhere that I've only ever been able to look at from afar, through the lens of scary newspaper headlines. I've found that there's often a huge gap between the everyday lived experience of people on the ground and the country as we understand it through geopolitics. I'm ready for any preconceptions I have to be totally shattered, and I'm excited to share my experience with New York Times readers.
What do you think will be the biggest challenges for this job?
I know the hardest part of this trip is going to be the abrupt end to any stability or normalcy I've created over the past few years. To say "see you in a year" to my (unconscionably supportive) partner, my friends and the routines I've developed here in New York is going to hurt. I also know I have to recognize the immense privilege I've been given and channel that sense of unmooring and the inevitable loneliness that will set in from time to time into motivation to keep going, keep learning, and keep telling stories. If past travels are anything to go by, you often find on-the-go support networks in the most unlikely of places.
How are you preparing for the trip, practically and emotionally?
I've found myself zeroing in on really small, likely inconsequential things. Do I finally give up on my sentimentality around physical books and buy a Kindle? (Probably.) Will I even have time to read books? (Probably not.) I get that a versatile pair of shoes is going to be important and I should probably start researching that, but "how many pairs of socks do I bring?" I think it's in part a way for me to avoid the larger existential questions, but I also think it's a good approach. I'm starting small and then gradually working my way up, because I know "where am I?" is going to be the question I end up asking the most.

Texto completo: FBI probed Trump, Times says: WASHINGTON — The New York Times reported late Friday that law enforcement officials became so concerned by President Donald Trump’s behavior in the days after he fired FBI Director James Comey that they began investigating whether he had been working for Russia against U.S. interests. The report cites unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation. Special counsel Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed soon after Comey’s firing. The Times says it’s unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing it. Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani told The Times that he had no knowledge of the inquiry but said that since it was opened a year and a half ago and they hadn’t heard anything, apparently "they found nothing."
Megyn Kelly, NBC officially part: NEW YORK — NBC News and anchor Megyn Kelly have split after months of negotiations, the network announced Friday night. No details were given. The transplant from Fox News has been off the air since late October after suggesting it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween. But reports suggest she was on her way out anyway as attempts to establish her in both a prime-time newsmagazine and in the third hour of the "Today" show fell flat. Kelly was in the second year of a three-year contract that reportedly paid her more than $20 million a year.
Challenge to Congo vote results: KINSHASA, Congo — Congo runner-up Martin Fayulu announced on Friday he will file a court challenge to the presidential election results, which officially show the winner being largely untested opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi. Fayulu accused outgoing President Joseph Kabila of making a backroom deal after it became clear his preferred candidate could not win. The influential Catholic Church has said its 40,000 election observers in all polling stations found a different winner from the official results, but it has not given details. Diplomats briefed on the findings say they found Fayulu won easily.
CDC issues flu numbers: NEW YORK — About 6 million to 7 million Americans have become ill since flu season kicked off last fall and roughly 70,000 to 80,000 have been hospitalized, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Agency officials are providing the estimates for the first time during flu season to underscore the risks of serious complications of the respiratory virus and to encourage people to vaccinated. Flu season usually peaks around February. Health officials said they expect this flu season to be gentler than last year’s, in which 80,000 Americans died of influenza and its complications. That number has typically ranged from 12,000 to 56,000 in recent years.
Ginsburg is cancer-free: WASHINGTON — Tests revealed that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has no additional cancer following her surgery in December, and no further treatment is needed, the Supreme Court announced Friday. Ginsburg had surgery Dec. 21 for two malignant nodules in her left lung, the 85-year-old’s third bout with cancer Saudi woman heads to Canada: BANGKOK — Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, an 18-year-old Saudi woman who said she was abused by her family and feared for her life if deported back home, on Friday left Thailand for Canada, which granted her asylum, officials said. She had fled her family while visiting Kuwait and fled to Bangkok, where she barricaded herself in an airport hotel to avoid deportation.

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet? In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2.5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ? Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat? Plants. Basically most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe? Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits? Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she enjoyed the journey and the results, including losing six pounds.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," wrote Josefsberg in a blog post.
Organic produce is recommended as part of a pegan diet.

Texto completo: Q. Where I live they have been changing the crosswalk buttons to these fancy new ones that beep, flash and talk to you. Why are all of the voices men’s voices? Isn’t this the age of equality?
– Patrick Shane, North Tustin
A. Patrick lives in unincorporated county territory, near the city of Tustin. After getting some specifics on the traffic signals, he and Honk agreed the city would be best to ask, as at least some of these new-school devices are in Tustin.
Krys Saldivar , the manager of the Tustin’s Public Works Department, said the city is upgrading all of its pedestrian push buttons tied to traffic signals, with about 40 percent having these newer devices.
“Those who are blind will be able to hear where they are crossing and when to cross, and those who are deaf will feel the vibration when it is safe to cross,” she told Honk in an email. “The first ones that have been installed in the city were actually programmed by the manufacturer.”
That would be Polara, a Texas-based company.
Its president, John McGaffey , said if a city asks, Polara can provide a female voice; it has done so before. But it generally uses a male voice.
“In controlled studies using … accessible pedestrian signals, the majority of the visually impaired participants said they were able to hear a male voice better because it has greater low-range frequencies (under 800 Hz), which people can tend to hear, even with some hearing loss. We also try to keep the voice consistent so the messages sound similar, no matter where you are in the United States.”
Q. My license expires on my birthday in June. Should I go ahead and make an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles now because of the crowded DMV offices, with the popularity of the REAL ID? Or should I wait until they send me a notice? It’s very confusing! Thank you!
– Linda Wells, Mission Viejo
A. DMV officials and Honk readers have told the wise one, that would be Honk, that wait times have gone way down since the mess in the summer.
Still, appointments are the way to go if you must go into an office to renew your license (Typically every 15 years until you hit age 70, then every five years).
“She can make an appointment before she receives her renewal notice,” Marty Greenstein , a DMV spokesman up in Sacramento, said via email. “In fact, that’s something we encourage. If you know your license is going to expire in a few months, go ahead and make your appointment. We started sending out renewal notices 90 days in advance this summer (up from 60) to give people more time.”
The DMV takes appointments for several months out. Linda noticed that the two DMV offices near her home were completely booked. What about that?
“Appointment availability can change on a daily basis as offices perform daily assessments, or spots open when an appointment is canceled,” Greenstein said.
So keep trying, Linda.
But don’t go too early to a DMV office to renew, or you will be required to take what used to be called a “written” test and is now a “knowledge” test (it is usually done on a touchscreen these days) even if you weren’t scheduled for one. The DMV reasons that if you renew real early, then you are shortening up the time it has to monitor your track record out there on the roads, so the test is meant to ensure you are a safe motorist.
“In instances when a knowledge test is not required, coming in at any time during that 90-day window before your license expires should not trigger that requirement,” Greenstein added.
Honkin’ cool: A dad didn’t want his daughter to be alone on Christmas, so Hal Vaughan took six flights over three days to be with her. Pierce Vaughan is a rookie flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, and Dad shadowed her, able to jump on standby for free, a perk of his daughter’s job. A passenger heard about the journey, put it on Facebook and the cute story went viral. The trip: New Orleans; Detroit; Fort Myers, Fla.; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Atlanta; and back to New Orleans (Source: The New York Times).

Clearing the clutter Inspired by Marie Kondo, Spokane fans get organized

Texto completo: During childhood, Wendi Eva loved organizing her closet and books just so. As a busy Spokane Valley mom, she struggled to keep household order until she found inspiration in Marie Kondo, a renowned tidying expert and author.
In fact, Eva jumped in full-force a year ago to create a Facebook page BreathingRooms, mixing her own ideas with Kondo's. More than 400 followers trade ideas. On Jan. 1, the group began weekly challenges to clear clutter and organize with Kondo's "KonMari" method.
Kondo created a sensation with her No. 1 New York Times best-selling book, "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up." Now, people can watch her help people tackle the clutter in their homes with eight episodes of "Tidy Up," which came to Netflix on Jan. 1.
Kondo urges people to only keep things that "spark joy." Eva, 42, is a fan. She describes a year-long journey learning what to keep and how to order her things by categories, versus clever organizing ideas..
"I've always defined clutter as deferred decisions," Eva said. "The truth is you can read all the organizing articles you want or buy all the clever organizers at the container store, but you're always going to return to the same problem if you don't reach decisions about your things," Eva said.
"I really believe the key to decluttering is changing your mindset and learning to think differently about stuff. It involves material things but it also involves your level of commitment and amount of digital clutter you have. You learn to make intentional decisions."
Here are seven tidying "mindset" tips:
1. Give experiential gifts
Many members of BreathingRooms are parents, and they gave the most kudos to the idea of giving children and family members the gifts of experiences and time, rather than material things.
Eva brought this notion up in BreathingRooms near the holidays, but it applies year-round, she said. "It's going to matter even more to them and it's not going to end up in a dark corner of a closet."
Examples include a museum membership or fun classes to develop new skills. It could even be a family "staycation," which Eva, her husband and their two kids, ages 12 and 10, do every December.
"We stay in a local hotel for two nights, different ones every year, and it's devoted family time to swim in the pool, get free breakfasts and we do local touristy things. We've created great family memories that way and I don't have to store anything, clean anything or maintain anything, so I love that."
2. Categorize paper
From mail to children's art projects, paper is one of the biggest contributors to clutter, Eva said.
"I tell people to deal with paper the instant it enters your home," she said.
With mail, she creates separate paper piles by categories: trash, bills to pay, things to read and items requiring follow-up. Then she tries to act on each pile immediately. "If you can't immediately act on all the piles, at least throw out the garbage."
Some parents turn children's artwork into gift wrap. Eva has other tips, one being the online company ArtKive. Parents can send a collection of children's art work and mementos to the business, which compiles them into a memory book. "That's a great service, but a little pricey," she said.
She keeps memory boxes for each child labeled per year of life. In them, Eva saves the most meaningful letters, poetry or short stories, report cards and memories. "They have to say something, not just just birthday cards with a signature."
For 3-D items, she separately keeps one clear storage bin that goes under a child's bed that typically hold one baby outfit, a keepsake such as a diary, and other sentimental artifacts. Eva will go back periodically and assess what items to keep in those containers.
3. See gifts differently
Guilt often stops people from getting rid of gifts that aren't wanted, Eva said. Another way to think about them is the intent that gifts are meant to bless others.
"Gifts are intended to bless somebody, and if they don't bless you, then you can return them or pass them on. You don't need to keep them. The blessing of a gift is really in the fact that the person thought enough of you to give you something."
To donate gifts, people can consider their favorite charity or thrift shop, she said.
4. Reduce clothing
"I think pretty much everyone has too much clothing," Eva said. She heard a statistic that people wear about 20 percent of their wardrobe 80 percent of the time. "It's true that people wear their favorites over and over."
Donate what you don't wear or items that aren't in a "feeling fabulous" category.
Eva also believes a key is to store clothes so you easily can see items in closets and drawers, preferably using Kondo's folding tips and vertically filing. Some people follow a "capsule wardrobe," where you select a limited number of high-quality clothing items that are interchangeable.
"I haven't done it yet, but I'm considering it," she said. "People say it makes decisions in the morning so much easier and keeps you on top of your laundry."
Eva uses a five-box method for closets or any household space by category:
Throw-away box for trash;
Stow-away box for what really belongs elsewhere;
Lay-away box for items such as photos that are too time-consuming in the moment;
Put-away box for materials you're keeping to put back into the space you're conquering;
Give-away box for returning borrowed items, selling, donating or re-gifting to others.
5. Redefine waste
Concerns about being wasteful is another reason people don't get rid of things, Eva said. But items left in storage and never used can also be defined as wasteful.
"It's also wasteful to sacrifice your time, energy and space," she said. "I'd say for people who are sensitive to waste, maybe you'd prefer donating it to someone you know can really use it."
That might be supporting refugees furnishing a home. Eva was able to donate her wedding dress to a local organization that provides bridal attire for people who couldn't afford it.
Kondo suggests tackling sentimental items last when considering household organization, Eva added.
When donating or gifting, she sometimes goes to a Buy Nothing neighborhood group on Facebook. The Buy Nothing Project isn't a forum to sell or buy items, or even trade, but rather for sharing or gifting. "It's similar to the Freecycle Network, but it's hyper-local."
Eva will get rid of a rarely used piece under a 20-20 rule. "If you can get it again for $20, or spend less than 20 minutes worth of your time to get it."
6. Guard purchases
"You have to start to be diligent about monitoring purchases at point of purchase," Eva said.
Filter with questions, such as:
How long will the item last?
Does it bring joy or is it essential?
Is it limited to season or function?
"Be like a bouncer making sure something doesn't come into your home unless it's a favorite or has lots of uses."
7. Purge by habit
Many in the BreathingRooms space have adopted a frequent habit to purge, rather than clearing clutter once a year, to combat the constant inflow of items entering the home.
"It's kind of like weight loss," Eva said. "You can go on diet but you have to maintain it. It's the same with clutter."
If you're empty-nesters dealing with left-behind possessions of older children, ask them to reclaim possessions in batches if they have their own place.
Unload mental clutter, too. "This last year, I cut back on commitments and number of activities," Eva said. "I can only invest in so many."

Texto completo: Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen -- after fighting financial crises and anemic economic growth as Federal Reserve leaders -- are turning their attention to a different problem: How women are treated in their own profession.
"Economics certainly has a problem," Mr. Bernanke, a former Fed chairman, said at a recent meeting of the American Economic Association. "We have a very low ratio of women in terms of our professional ranks and, unfortunately, a reputation for hostility towards women and minorities seems to be an important reason why many women choose not to become economists."
It is robbing the profession of a major source of talent and insight, said Mr. Bernanke, the organization's incoming president, during its annual gathering in Atlanta last week.
Mr. Bernanke said he and Ms. Yellen are working to address the issue.
"This should be the highest priority for us over the next couple of years," said Ms. Yellen, who in 2014 became the first woman to lead the Fed when she succeeded Mr. Bernanke. Her term ended in February 2018.
Women make up about 30% of the nation's undergraduate economics majors, while minorities represent just 12%, according to a 2017 Fed study. That is compared with overall student bodies that are almost 58% women and 21% minorities.
Academic studies in recent years have shown women in economics are less likely to be promoted, even when they are just as productive; female-authored papers in top economics journals go through a longer process of peer review, and women economics instructors receive lower teacher evaluations.
The very subject may breed sexism, according to Valentina Paredes of the University of Chile and two co-authors. Their new working paper, released in December, found Chilean male students' gender bias rose with their years of economics training. One factor that made a difference: more female professors.
The AEA and wider profession has grappled with hostility toward women in recent years. The group was asked by more than 1,000 economists to create its own job board in 2017, after a study found vulgar and misogynist language directed toward women on a website used to find economics jobs.
Discussion in the field about the treatment of women in economics intensified last month, after the New York Times reported Harvard University was investigating allegations that one of its top economics professors, Roland Fryer, fostered a hostile work environment for women. Mr. Fryer subsequently resigned from the AEA's executive committee.
In a statement to The Wall Street Journal on Friday, Mr. Fryer said, "We must do more to include underrepresented minorities in our profession to insure that diverse perspectives are represented and new and innovative approaches to research are pursued." He added, "If false allegations against me are a necessary catalyst to elevate this issue and help the profession generate a constructive, systemic response, I can live with that."
Harvard didn't respond to a request to comment.

Texto completo: An aide to President Obama boasted to the New York Times about lying and manipulating the media to sell the administration's Iran policy. Mr. Obama himself proselytized for his health-care plan by saying that, despite mandatory requirements that outlawed millions of individual health plans, you'd be able to keep your existing plan. Nor is there the slightest ambiguity now: His administration deliberately lied to the American people about the origins of the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya.
We could go on. Candidate Obama, in a formal address, explained that Detroit's financial troubles were due to its large, gas-guzzling cars. This was ridiculous. Businesses fail because of products that don't make money, not the ones that do. But smart pols know which fibs the media will applaud.
Lying is the other mother's milk of politics. Political leaders are always making less-than-optimal decisions. They act within political constraints. They are often less concerned with the thing itself than how it might affect the next election or progress on some unrelated priority.
All political speech is a means to an end. Getting their priorities enacted is more important to politicians than telling the truth about them. Whether their policies even have the desired effect often is less important than racking up a "win" and avoiding a "loss."
All this applies to Donald Trump and his signature promise, the wall.
The wall is mostly symbolic in relation to the issue of illegal immigration. It's more important now to the president's standing with his voter base, and to his hope of re-election. To Mr. Trump and his opponents, the current shutdown fight is a test of power. The Democrats are looking for a chance to defeat the president for the sake of defeating him.
Yet one thing is also true: As with just about everything Donald Trump does, his blunt and often grossly hyperbolic statements and gestures are in the service of deeply conventional policy.
Any immigration system is cruel: It keeps out people who want to come in, such as the opportunity-seeking Central American families pouring north at the moment. Millions would come if they could. Jeh Johnson, Mr. Obama's homeland security chief, frankly acknowledged last year, when the child detention furor was getting started, that in such circumstances "deterrence" is the only realistic strategy -- that is, unless and until the U.S. wants to fix the domestic problems of every country that refugees and migrants are fleeing.
Deterrence is the symbolic function of the Trump wall. Deterrence has been the formal U.S. game plan since "Bill Clinton's presidency," goes a long, accusatory wail in New York magazine, which dwells on the suffering of migrants.
Except that it extends much further back. See the 1949 film noir "Border Incident" about people-smuggling: "It is this problem of human suffering and injustice about which you should know," intones the narrator.
The deterrent effect comes not from the risk of apprehension by U.S. border agents but from the risk of dying in the desert or being robbed, exploited or murdered by trafficker gangs.
This is the force holding back the tide.
Unfortunately the world also hears our ambivalence. As the 1949 film dramatized, smugglers peddle their services based on their knowledge of the modes and moods of U.S. border security. Mr. Trump quickly learned what Presidents Obama and Bush knew: Our legal and humanitarian inhibitions about the handling of small children are a particular lacuna. Since a 2003 immigration reshuffle, the processing of minors has been dumped in the lap of the Health and Human Services Department. It soon developed a reputation for handing children back to traffickers and sweatshop operators purporting to be their legal guardians. Happily, Sens. Rob Portman and Tom Carper, leaders of a Homeland Security investigative subcommittee, have been trying to right the mess since before Donald Trump took office.
But everything Mr. Trump does and says must now be attacked by the media in a way that didn't apply to the lies and evasions of his predecessors. Photos of caged immigrant children shot during the Obama administration must be attributed to Trump policy. Mr. Trump must be shown to be illegitimate.
This is the flip side of Mr. Trump's own sorry failure to continue the mystifications that power uses to conceal its dilemmas. We have long tolerated illegal immigration by those who survive the rigors of people-smuggling or exploit loopholes by towing small children along. Given enough time, Mr. Trump might also be acculturated into the virtues of keeping quiet or directing attention elsewhere. He came into office as a person who imagined his advantage was bluntness, as if this made him the antidote to what came before (it did) and provided an actual solution to dilemmas (it didn't).
Still, give Mr. Trump and his voters credit: Our screwed-up immigration system has become harder for Congress and the public to ignore. Who knows? This might even be leading to a productive moment.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is closing in on announcing a 2020 presidential campaign, signing up key staff members and planning her first trip to Iowa, according to people familiar with the plans.
Ms. Gillibrand's staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her Senate chief of staff, and Dan McNally, a former campaign aide to Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) and the campaign arm of Senate Democrats, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.
Meredith Kelly, a top communications aide to the House Democrats' campaign arm, will lead Ms. Gillibrand's communications operation, the people said. Ms. Kelly's hiring was earlier reported by the New York Times.
She has also hired two top digital aides, Emmy Bengtson and Gavrie Kullman, both highly-sought-after Democratic digital specialists, according to people familiar with the move.
Ms. Gillibrand's hiring spree likely foreshadows a wave of entrants to the Democratic contest, which includes Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who was set to make a formal announcement about his plans Saturday in his hometown of San Antonio.
California Sen. Kamala Harris is wrapping up a brief book tour this weekend and expects soon to make an announcement about her intentions. Several Democratic senators are also weighing national campaigns.
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, meanwhile, plans to sit down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey on Feb. 5 in New York, stoking speculation he may join the race after his narrow loss to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
Ms. Winfrey was instrumental in President Obama's rise during the 2008 primaries.

Search for wall funds could hit Ga. projects: GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN: DAY 22

Texto completo: At Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, officials said security standards "remain uncompromised" during the partial federal shutdown. Transportation Security Administration statistics show the maximum wait time at Hartsfield-Jackson for standard screening Thursday was 25 minutes. It said 92.7 percent of those passengers waited less than 15 minutes, while TSA PreCheck passengers waited a maximum of six minutes.
WASHINGTON--President Donald Trump could divert hundreds of millions of dollars intended for Georgia projects to pay for a wall on the southern border, including hard-fought funding previously set aside for the state's top economic development project.
That could happen because, if Trump declares a national emergency over border security, current law allows him to raid money from the Army Corps of Engineers and military construction projects. Georgia has had money set aside for more than a half-dozen military projects in the past two budget years, as well as Savannah's port dredging project.
Trump has been openly mulling declaring such an emergency to circumvent Congress and secure the $5.7 billion he wants to build the wall, a central campaign pledge that's been at the heart of the three-week shutdown showdown with Democrats that's left roughly 16,000 Georgians furloughed or working without pay.
But on Friday, Trump said he was not looking to declare a national emergency "right now," a reversal from recent comments that made the move sound imminent.
Under current law, declaring a national emergency would allow the president to take money Congress previously approved for Army civil works projects "that he deems non-essential to the national defense," giving him broad leeway to decide which coffers could be used to pay, in this case, for a wall.
Eligible money includes military construction projects whose budgets haven't already been obligated, as well as projects funded under the Army Corps of Engineers' construction accounts, according to a House Democratic aide who was not authorized to speak on the record and confirmed by a lobbyist familiar with the programs.
Over the past two fiscal years, Congress set aside roughly $186 million in the corps' construction budget for work to deepen the riverbed in the Savannah harbor, a top-tier economic development project for the state that has united politicians from both sides of the aisle.
It's unclear exactly how much of that money has already been obligated, or committed to contracts, but the president could choose to take some if not all of the unspent dollars, according to the House aide. Spokesmen for the Georgia Ports Authority, the corps and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.
Ditto for the roughly $230 million in smaller construction projects at Georgia's Fort Benning, Fort Gordon and Robins Air Force Base that Congress approved over the past two fiscal years. Information was not readily available on how much of that money -- which was approved to build a cyber instructional facility, access control point and other infrastructure--has been spent to date, but given that both the
fiscal 2018 and 2019 spending deals were approved within the past year, it's likely there are sizable chunks that have yet to be obligated.
Spokesmen for the three Georgia bases did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump said Friday that he was not looking to immediately declare a national emergency, but in recent days he has defended his authority to do so to expedite construction of the wall.
"What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency," he said at a White House roundtable on Friday afternoon. "I'm not going to do it so fast."
But, in a tweet, he also called the border's security "a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion!"
Trump added that Democratic leaders "don't know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY."
Democratshaveresponded that they are for tightening border security but will not "waste money" on a wall they say would be ineffective.
"One person is responsible for shutting down government: Donald Trump," said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md.
In Georgia, the state's GOP lawmakers would be in a tough spot should Trump pursue the emergency avenue. All have been vocal advocates for the port and the state's military bases, but they have also been supportive of the president and his quest to build a border wall.
"I do believe we need to continue to fund the construction projects within our military and we'll get to that. But I think this is an option we can use because this is a security crisis we are dealing with," U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, told Cox Media Group on Friday.
U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Pooler, whose 1st Congressional District includes Savannah, said he was in touch with the administration, the corps and the relevant House committees. He called the prospect of Georgia projects losing money to pay for the border wall "hearsay and hypothetical."
"If Democrats continue to hold our government hostage and force President Trump to take his own actions to secure the border, I will continue working with the relevant departments to ensure the critical projects in the 1st District are protected and receive the resources needed," he said.
Carter said he would prefer that Congress provide funding for the border wall rather than Trump being "forced into declaring a state of emergency," but he -- like several Georgia Republicans in recent days -- also indicated he was open to the president using the designation to both end the shutdown and start building the wall.
One coastal community that could be particularly impacted by Trump's emergency designation is in Carter's district.
The pot of money Trump has been eyeing most seriously to build the wall, according to media reports, has been a $13.9 billion account at the corps set aside for disaster recovery efforts. It includes $13 million to help Tybee Island rebuild its sand dunes.
The city had pushed for state and federal money to revitalize its buffer system for years, particularly after hurricanes Matthew and Irma, Mayor Jason Buelterman said. But very little federal money so far has been obligated, said Howard Marlowe, who lobbies for Tybee in Washington.
During both storms, "water poured through the gaps that we had in our dunes system and flooded properties far behind the initial front-line beachfront property," Buelterman said.
"If we don't get (the money)," he said, "we'll be stuck with no beach for storm-surge protection, a compromised dunes system and then, also, you don't have anywhere for people to go to the beach at high tide."

16-Year-Old With ISIS Is Not American

Texto completo: A 16-year-old boy who was captured on the battlefield in Syria this week with fighters for the Islamic State is not American, but is instead from Trinidad and Tobago, according to American officials and the boy's sister.
The teenager was taken from the Caribbean nation to the war zone when he was 12 by his mother, who converted to Islam after becoming romantically involved with a radicalized man, Sarah Lee Su, the boy's older sister, said in a phone interview.
After a four-year silence, she heard from them for the first time last month, when her mother contacted her on Facebook Messenger and sent a series of audio recordings that said the two were alive and pleading for help. She said they were hiding somewhere in Syria.
"I need money to help us get out of here," Gailon Su, the mother, said in one of the recordings she sent to her daughter, which was shared with The New York Times. "If not me, your brother. He is innocent."
The American-backed militia that announced the boy's capture on Wednesday said he was among three American citizens apprehended in recent days in the battle zone fighting for the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS. But Pentagon and State Department officials said only one of the three -- Warren Christopher Clark, 34, a former substitute teacher from Texas -- was an American.
On Friday, two American officials said that Mr. Clark would soon be transferred to F.B.I. custody. He will be flown to the United States, where he will face federal charges in Houston, the officials said.
The 16-year-old, who was erroneously identified in a news release from the American-backed militia as Soulay Noah Su, an American citizen, is actually Su-lay Su from Trinidad, the boy's sister said. She recognized him in a photo released by the militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, she said.
A team led by Hany Farid, a Dartmouth College computer science professor, used facial identification software to compare the photo with images of Su-lay posted on social media and concluded with "high confidence" that the two were the same person.
Ms. Su, 23, said her mother and brother had fallen under the sway of a Trinidadian man who eventually persuaded them in 2014 to travel to the budding ISIS caliphate. "Once they got to Syria," Ms. Su said, "they told me that this guy took their documents and destroyed them, and said, 'You are now going to stay here and die."'
In the audio recordings Gailon Su sent to her daughter, she said, "Everyone wants to be blaming me, that I did bad things to my children. I just married a man."
According to a database maintained by Simon Cottee, a University of Kent criminologist, the mother and son were part of a group of 10 people taken to Syria by Anthony Hamlet; also included were Mr. Hamlet's second wife, two of his daughters and three other boys, Mr. Cottee said.
After departing in September 2014, Mr. Hamlet appeared in ISIS propaganda, including in a photo spread in the terror group's online magazine and in a video in which he is shown on his stomach, peering through the scope of a rifle.
"In my research on ISIS in Trinidad, one of my most striking findings is the block nature of the migrations to Syria and Iraq," said Mr. Cottee, who is working on a book on jihadists from Trinidad, which has one of the world's highest per capita rates of recruitment to ISIS. Mr. Cottee first noticed the captured teenager had a similar name to one in his database on Wednesday.
"It wasn't just individuals going," he said. "It was entire families looking to remake their lives in the so-called caliphate."
Little is known about the mother and son's time in Syria and the mother's current whereabouts is unknown.
The boy's Facebook timeline, which is sparse, reveals only a handful of photos that speak to possible military activity. Of greater interest to him appear to be posts about flashy hightop sneakers. Because Su-lay was 12 when his mother took him to Syria, "He didn't have any say or agency in the matter," Mr. Cottee said. "So he is a victim as much as a perpetrator in the Syrian jihad."
The posts by his mother on her Facebook page, identified as authentic by her daughter, indicated more agency in her own radicalization as well as a willingness to support her son's exploration of military activities.
In a post in 2013, a year before they left for Syria, Su-lay's mother congratulated him on his excellent grades. A year later, she liked a photo that her son had posted, presumably from Syria, of a mounted rifle. The following year, she liked a photo showing him in what appeared to be military fatigues.
But in one of the final messages she sent to her daughter last month, Ms. Su said she did not want her son to fight.
"Yesterday some people stopped him and they want him to go and fight," she said in the audio message. "I don't want my child to be crippled."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is closing in on announcing a 2020 presidential campaign, signing up key staff members and planning her first trip to Iowa, according to people familiar with the plans.
Ms. Gillibrand's staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her Senate chief of staff, and Dan McNally, a former campaign aide to Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) and the campaign arm of Senate Democrats, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.
Meredith Kelly, a top communications aide to the House Democrats' campaign arm, will lead Ms. Gillibrand's communications operation, the people said. Ms. Kelly's hiring was first reported by the New York Times.
She has also hired two top digital aides, Emmy Bengtson and Gavrie Kullman, both highly sought-after Democratic digital specialists, according to people familiar with the move.
Ms. Gillibrand's hiring spree likely foreshadows a wave of entrants to the Democratic contest, which includes Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro , who was set to make a formal announcement about his plans Saturday in his hometown of San Antonio.
California Sen. Kamala Harris is wrapping up a brief book tour this weekend and expects soon to make an announcement about her intentions. Several Democratic senators are also weighing national campaigns.
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, meanwhile, plans to sit down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey on Feb. 5 in New York, stoking speculation he may join the race after his narrow loss to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
Ms. Winfrey was instrumental in President Obama's rise during the 2008 primaries.
As part of the preparations, Ms. Gillibrand has hired Joi Chaney to become her new Senate chief of staff. Ms. Chaney formerly served as a staff member in the Senate and the Obama administration at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Glen Caplin, a longtime Senate aide to Ms. Gillibrand who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, is also expected to play a senior advisory role in her campaign. Mr. Caplin declined to comment.
Ms. Gillibrand plans to travel next weekend to Iowa--the location of the first 2020 presidential caucus and a sign that her campaign will be soon under way. Ms. Gillibrand's Iowa plans were reported Thursday night by Politico.
Ms. Gillibrand, 52 years old, entered the Senate in 2009 when she was appointed to the seat held by Mrs. Clinton, who became Mr. Obama's secretary of state. Ms Gillibrand most recently coasted to re-election in 2018 and has more than $10.6 million left over from her Senate campaign, seed money that can be used in her presidential bid.
The senator has positioned herself as a leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, with whom she tangled in December 2017 after the president called her a "flunky" for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and said she would do "anything" for a political donation.
Ms. Gillibrand responded that Mr. Trump couldn't silence her or the millions of women from speaking out "about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office."
Following a midterm election cycle in which Democratic women took center stage, Ms. Gillibrand has championed electing more women to office and has been a leading voice in the #MeToo anti-sexual harassment and assault movement.
But some Democrats have accused her of opportunism, pointing to her evolution on issues such as immigration and gun control, and her role as the first Senate Democrat to call for the resignation of former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken after the Democrat was accused of sexual misconduct.
Ms. Gillibrand's advisers said at the time that she was standing up for her values.
She also had a public break with former President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton in 2017, telling the New York Times that it would have been an "appropriate response" for Mr. Clinton to resign in 1998 following the revelations of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Ms. Gillibrand noted the differences between the late 1990s and the current environment, but some Clinton allies accused her of betraying the Democratic power couple who had nurtured her political career.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii), meanwhile, said Friday in an interview with CNN slated to air Saturday that she had "decided to run" and would make a formal announcement within a week. Ms. Gabbard, a 37-year-old veteran of the Iraq war, was a top surrogate for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign in 2016 and has carved out a role in Congress on foreign and military affairs.
Ms. Gabbard told CNN's Van Jones in the interview that the "issue of war and peace" would be central to her campaign. She faced criticism in the spring of 2017 when she met in Syria with President Bashar al-Assad and later questioned whether he was responsible for a deadly chemical attack on civilians that led to a U.S. attack on an air base.

Texto completo: Ted and Dolores Aragon emerged from a Northeast Albuquerque Smith's store on Wednesday afternoon with their freshly purchased groceries ensconced in three tan plastic bags the type of bags some elected officials want to help eliminate in the state's largest city.
As they loaded the food into their black pickup, the retirees said they enthusiastically support the newly proposed single-use plastic ban.
“I'm all for it,” Ted Aragon said, noting that he already keeps several reusable grocery bags in his vehicle. He just failed to carry them inside the store.
“I keep forgetting, but if they do away with them, I'll have to (remember),” he said.
Four city councilors want to ban single-use plastic bags, straws and nonrecyclable takeout food containers, thereby adding Albuquerque to a growing list of communities enacting similar policies meant to protect the environment.
“Once it's passed, it will be the city of Albuquerque's commitment to a cleaner future for all of us,” said Councilor Diane Gibson, who co-sponsored the legislation with fellow Democratic colleagues Isaac Benton, Cynthia Borrego and Pat Davis.
But the idea does not sit well with everybody.
As they headed into the Walmart at Carlisle and Menaul NE on Wednesday afternoon, business partners LaDonna Carley and Kathy Willey expressed their objections.
Even though Carley often shops with reusable totes, she still likes to occasionally use single-use plastic bags to line trash cans or to separate and store items at home.
And she's even more disconcerted by a different part of the ordinance.
“I can't live without my straws,” she said, adding that the paper versions that will remain legal under the proposal are a poor substitute.
“They suck,” she said. “You take a couple of drinks out of them, and they're all soggy and then they're flat and they get caught in your teeth and throat.”
The new bill would not completely outlaw plastic straws. It would require any business that offers straws to keep plastic ones available for customers to “provide accessibility options for persons with disabilities and medical requirements.”
Councilor Benton this week acknowledged that change is often difficult but defended this one as necessary. The bills' sponsors credited several elementary-school children for helping spur the legislation by advocating for a plastic bag ban during public comment at a City Council meeting in December. The children voiced concern about plastic bags' impact on animal and human health and the environment.
Benton said biodegradable bags and food containers were the norm in his childhood.
Now, the average American uses 365 plastic bags a year, according to a 2018 National Geographic Report. And the country goes through a few hundred million straws per day, according to market research cited by The New York Times.
“We've only had a generation or two of these plastic replacements. There's nothing wrong with going back in some cases; in this case, it's time to reverse course and pay the true cost of our consumption, which is not going to be much, but it's going to be a factor,” Benton said.
Bans in other cities
Albuquerque would follow the lead of cities like Seattle, which in 2018 banned restaurants and all food service providers from distributing plastic straws and utensils. In 2009, Seattle banned restaurants from using Styrofoam, and in 2010, it enacted a ban on all nonrecyclable or noncompostable disposable food packaging.
California, meanwhile, has prohibited most retailers from giving out single-use plastic bags since 2016. A 2018 law prevents full-service restaurants from providing plastic straws, unless a customer requests one. But individual municipalities, such as Manhattan Beach, have passed more comprehensive bans.
The new Albuquerque proposal wraps multiple bans into one ordinance and is drawing fire from some in the private sector.
The legislation notes that major American businesses are moving in a similar direction. Starbucks said it plans to stop providing plastic straws by 2020, while Dunkin' Donuts intends to quit using foam cups by next year. But Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce CEO Terri Cole said she is hearing “significant concerns” about the Albuquerque proposal from big and small businesses. She said it could raise costs for companies and therefore consumers, and is “uninformed government intrusion” that might make the city less attractive to businesses.
The New Mexico Restaurant Association has already signaled opposition, saying it would raise costs and force eateries to buy recyclable straws and carryout containers that are sometimes hard to find because of the growing demand for them.
Businesses, pro and con
Il Vicino, an Albuquerque-based pizza chain with eight locations in New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas, said the company is probably already compliant with the bill's terms. The pizzeria packages large to-go orders in paper bags and has already switched to paper straws. They cost more, Post said, and took a while to source for the New Mexico locations, but they haven't significantly affected costs. That's largely because the wait staff stopped automatically distributing straws, giving them out only when customers want them, so the patrons use fewer. Post said he's happy to see the new proposal.
“I think we'll adjust. We need to do this … for the larger good, if you will,” he said. “There may be a little more expense, but I'm not against it.”
But Dan Garcia, an owner of Garcia's Kitchen, said the ban would have a “huge” impact on the six-restaurant chain. Carryout represents about 30 percent to 40 percent of the company's business, and the two Garcia's drive-through locations exclusively use disposable cups and containers, even for patrons who eat inside.
The chain currently spends about 10 cents for single-compartment foam boxes, whereas a compliant recyclable version would cost around 30 cents. Garcia's buys about 5,000 a month for its Indian School drive-through location, so a switch would raise costs about $12,000 per year for that one location. And that does not include swapping out straws, bags and other trays.
“If it was just the straws, OK, that's not so bad,” Garcia said. But he said he objects to the proposal and said the totality of the ordinance, combined with other rising costs he cited proposed paid sick leave legislation means he would have no choice but to raise prices.
The new proposal would allow retailers to charge consumers up to 10 cents per approved bag. It would allow single-use paper bags, as long as they met the city's recycling standards.
But Garcia said customers often complain about such small markups.
“It's amazing. You try to tell a customer you're going to charge them 10 cents per bag, (and they say,) ‘Oh, man, you guys are nickel-and-diming us,' ” he said.

Amazon’s Ring videos from inside customers’ homes viewed in cybercrime hotbed: reports

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon’s Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely — but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that’s a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times’ popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring’s video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: “A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers’ video streams or recordings.”
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring’s mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, “the company’s treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but.”
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team “virtually unfettered access” to “every video created by every Ring camera around the world,” according to The Intercept.
“The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers,” the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company’s image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
“A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring’s video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors,” The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
“The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing.”
The site’s reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team’s location.
“The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime,” according to The Information. “If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone’s home.”
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees’ viewing of video, according to The Intercept. “Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example,” the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers’ personal information very seriously.
“These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes,” the spokesperson said.
“Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products.”
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, “anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them.”
According to The Intercept, Ring describes “Neighbors” — a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras — without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that “those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab.”
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, “you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors,” the site reported.

Politicians Never Lied Before Trump; Look past the circus of democracy: The U.S. is finally facing up to its border failures.

Texto completo: An aide to President Obama boasted to the New York Times about lying and manipulating the media to sell the administration's Iran policy. Mr. Obama himself proselytized for his health-care plan by saying that, despite mandatory requirements that outlawed millions of individual health plans, you'd be able to keep your existing plan. Nor is there the slightest ambiguity now: His administration deliberately lied to the American people about the origins of the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. consulate in Libya.
We could go on. Candidate Obama, in a formal address, explained that Detroit's financial troubles were due to its large, gas-guzzling cars. This was ridiculous. Businesses fail because of products that don't make money, not the ones that do. But smart pols know which fibs the media will applaud.
Lying is the other mother's milk of politics. Political leaders are always making less-than-optimal decisions. They act within political constraints. They are often less concerned with the thing itself than how it might affect the next election or progress on some unrelated priority.
All political speech is a means to an end. Getting their priorities enacted is more important to politicians than telling the truth about them. Whether their policies even have the desired effect often is less important than racking up a "win" and avoiding a "loss."
All this applies to Donald Trump and his signature promise, the wall.
The wall is mostly symbolic in relation to the issue of illegal immigration. It's more important now to the president's standing with his voter base, and to his hope of re-election. To Mr. Trump and his opponents, the current shutdown fight is a test of power. The Democrats are looking for a chance to defeat the president for the sake of defeating him.
Yet one thing is also true: As with just about everything Donald Trump does, his blunt and often grossly hyperbolic statements and gestures are in the service of deeply conventional policy.
Any immigration system is cruel: It keeps out people who want to come in, such as the opportunity-seeking Central American families pouring north at the moment. Millions would come if they could. Jeh Johnson, Mr. Obama's homeland security chief, frankly acknowledged last year, when the child detention furor was getting started, that in such circumstances "deterrence" is the only realistic strategy --that is, unless and until the U.S. wants to fix the domestic problems of every country that refugees and migrants are fleeing.
Deterrence is the symbolic function of the Trump wall. Deterrence has been the formal U.S. game plan since "Bill Clinton's presidency," goes a long, accusatory wail in New York magazine, which dwells on the suffering of migrants.
Except that it extends much further back. See the 1949 film noir "Border Incident" about people-smuggling: "It is this problem of human suffering and injustice about which you should know," intones the narrator.
The deterrent effect comes not from the risk of apprehension by U.S. border agents but from the risk of dying in the desert or being robbed, exploited or murdered by trafficker gangs.
This is the force holding back the tide.
Unfortunately the world also hears our ambivalence. As the 1949 film dramatized, smugglers peddle their services based on their knowledge of the modes and moods of U.S. border security. Mr. Trump quickly learned what Presidents Obama and Bush knew: Our legal and humanitarian inhibitions about the handling of small children are a particular lacuna. Since a 2003 immigration reshuffle, the processing of minors has been dumped in the lap of the Health and Human Services Department. It soon developed a reputation for handing children back to traffickers and sweatshop operators purporting to be their legal guardians. Happily, Sens. Rob Portman and Tom Carper, leaders of a Homeland Security investigative subcommittee, have been trying to right the mess since before Donald Trump took office.
But everything Mr. Trump does and says must now be attacked by the media in a way that didn't apply to the lies and evasions of his predecessors. Photos of caged immigrant children shot during the Obama administration must be attributed to Trump policy. Mr. Trump must be shown to be illegitimate.
This is the flip side of Mr. Trump's own sorry failure to continue the mystifications that power uses to conceal its dilemmas. We have long tolerated illegal immigration by those who survive the rigors of people-smuggling or exploit loopholes by towing small children along. Given enough time, Mr. Trump might also be acculturated into the virtues of keeping quiet or directing attention elsewhere. He came into office as a person who imagined his advantage was bluntness, as if this made him the antidote to what came before (it did) and provided an actual solution to dilemmas (it didn't).
Still, give Mr. Trump and his voters credit: Our screwed-up immigration system has become harder for Congress and the public to ignore. Who knows? This might even be leading to a productive moment.

Texto completo: The first show at the Minnesota Museum of American Art's new home in downtown St. Paul is like a housewarming party. Metaphorically speaking, the art on display is a selection of fancy hors d'oeuvres and nice Champagne along with the more casual chips and dip and cheese curds.
It's all here to usher in a new era for the once-transient 125-year-old art institution known as "The M."
The housewarming show is called "100 Years and Counting," and it offers a funky selection of 45 two- and three-dimensional works from the museum's collection in a new ground-floor gallery and adjacent hallway at the rehabbed historic Pioneer-Endicott Buildings. The latter space once was an alleyway, while the gallery's tiled floor was rescued from some iteration of the building's storied past.
What makes this show curious is the way it groups seemingly different works in what is otherwise a nice beginning for the museum's next chapter.
At the gallery entrance, for example, visitors are greeted by a giant multi-panel collage, "AIM and Art" (2014), by Duluth-based Frank Big Bear, who grew up on the White Earth Reservation. Featuring 144 images of Native American leaders, it faces a graceful watercolor by
Ojibwe artist Patrick DesJarlait that shows a pair of fishermen on Red Lake, piling fish into a boat against a watery backdrop that's very much in the jagged style of Italian Futurism.
Elsewhere, an Alec Soth portrait of a North Dakota oil fracker, shot for the New York Times in 2012, hangs next to Margaret Bourke-White's historic black-and-white photograph of two South African gold miners in 1950.
The idea behind these juxtapositions, according to executive director Kristin Makholm, is to create "conversations between disparate works" and "exciting new narratives" that are "just as interesting as the individual artworks themselves."
Indeed, these groupings are often thought-provoking. And there is a lot of good stuff to see and experience. But the curators have failed to provide viewers with enough context to truly initiate the kinds of conversations about colonialization, privilege, racism, classism and many other -isms that the M seems to want to have.
In the case of the works by Big Bear and DesJarlait, obviously they're both Native American artists from Minnesota -- but what else? Some text to explain these groupings would help.
Outside the gallery entrance, a window display showcases a gorgeous, minimal gray-and-deep-olive-green stoneware vase circa 1959 by Warren MacKenzie, the famed Minnesota potter who died Dec. 31, and his first wife, Alix MacKenzie. This vase is perched next to blackware pottery by renowned Native American ceramicist Maria Martinez, of the Tewa tribe in New Mexico.
Makholm has written extensive wall labels about each artist. Visitors hungry for more info can access a mobile platform (text "mmaa" to 56512). But when it comes to unpacking the pairings of works, that's up to the viewer.
Like a housewarming party, the focus of this show is about having a nice selection of stuff. As Makholm put it in an e-mail, it's a balance of "well-known and not-so-well-known artists, as well as a good balance of local and national artists. In other words, something for everybody."
Yes, but doesn't everybody want to know what's going on, and why they were invited to the party? One of the first questions you ask someone at a dinner party is "How do you know the host?" I found myself wishing that this show had allowed the works of art to ask questions like that of each other, and create more dynamic and even radical conversations for viewers, leaving them with more to think about.
A 2001 photograph by Wing Young Huie of a man in Locke, Calif., sitting in the same chair in which he sat as a kid in this town built by, and for, Chinese-Americans, hangs next to the photo "A Manchu Lady" (1910-12), shot by Lucy Monroe Calhoun, wife of the ambassador to China. It's a striking juxtaposition: a more documentary approach to Chinese-American culture next to a shot taken from a place of privilege, of a culture outside the photographer's own.
One of the driving forces behind the M's new space is an interest in fostering a space for community engagement and learning. We're all at the new house and the hors d'oeuvres have arrived. Now we are waiting for the actual conversations to begin. Cheers!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is closing in on announcing a 2020 presidential campaign, signing up key staff members and planning her first trip to Iowa, according to people familiar with the plans.
Ms. Gillibrand's staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her Senate chief of staff, and Dan McNally, a former campaign aide to Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) and the campaign arm of Senate Democrats, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.
Meredith Kelly, a top communications aide to the House Democrats' campaign arm, will lead Ms. Gillibrand's communications operation, the people said. Ms. Kelly's hiring was first reported by the New York Times.
She has also hired two top digital aides, Emmy Bengtson and Gavrie Kullman, both highly sought-after Democratic digital specialists, according to people familiar with the move.
Ms. Gillibrand's hiring spree likely foreshadows a wave of entrants to the Democratic contest, which includes Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro , who is making a formal announcement about his plans Saturday in his hometown of San Antonio.
California Sen. Kamala Harris is wrapping up a brief book tour this weekend and expects soon to make an announcement about her intentions. Several Democratic senators are also weighing national campaigns.
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, meanwhile, plans to sit down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey on Feb. 5 in New York, stoking speculation he may join the race after his narrow loss to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Ms. Winfrey was instrumental in President Obama's rise during the 2008 primaries.
As part of the preparations, Ms. Gillibrand has hired Joi Chaney to become her new Senate chief of staff. Ms. Chaney formerly served as a staff member in the Senate and the Obama administration at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Glen Caplin, a longtime Senate aide to Ms. Gillibrand who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, is also expected to play a senior advisory role in her campaign. Mr. Caplin declined to comment.
Ms. Gillibrand plans to travel next weekend to Iowa--the location of the first 2020 presidential caucus and a sign that her campaign will be soon under way. Ms. Gillibrand's Iowa plans were reported Thursday night by Politico.
Ms. Gillibrand, 52 years old, entered the Senate in 2009 when she was appointed to the seat held by Mrs. Clinton, who became Mr. Obama's secretary of state. Ms Gillibrand most recently coasted to re-election in 2018 and has more than $10.6 million left over from her Senate campaign, seed money that can be used in her presidential bid.
The senator has positioned herself as a leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, with whom she tangled in December 2017 after the president called her a "flunky" for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and said she would do "anything" for a political donation.
Ms. Gillibrand responded that Mr. Trump couldn't silence her or the millions of women from speaking out "about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office."
Following a midterm election cycle in which Democratic women took center stage, Ms. Gillibrand has championed electing more women to office and has been a leading voice in the #MeToo anti-sexual harassment and assault movement.
But some Democrats have accused her of opportunism, pointing to her evolution on issues such as immigration and gun control, and her role as the first Senate Democrat to call for the resignation of former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken after the Democrat was accused of sexual misconduct.
Ms. Gillibrand's advisers said at the time that she was standing up for her values.
She also had a public break with former President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton in 2017, telling the New York Times that it would have been an "appropriate response" for Mr. Clinton to resign in 1998 following the revelations of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Ms. Gillibrand noted the differences between the late 1990s and the current environment, but some Clinton allies accused her of betraying the Democratic power couple who had nurtured her political career.

Confessions of a Russiagate agnostic

Texto completo: I’ll admit it: I’m a Russiagate agnostic.

I’m perfectly open to the possibility that President Trump (or his campaign) colluded with Russians to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, but I just want to see evidence that proves it.

Being agnostic about Russiagate is challenging for a political commentator. Russia has dominated the news for the past two years, and people on each side have passionate and confidently held views. It seems either they’re convinced that Trump colluded and attempted to cover it up, or they’re convinced that it’s all a nothingburger cooked up to delegitimize the Trump presidency.

On such a polarizing issue that’s played a central role in our political debate, it’s been difficult to take a wait and see approach before forming a strong opinion. But it’s also hard to feel confident about any narrative without knowing more.

In the absence of any report from special counsel Robert Mueller, much of the commentary involves speculation about what he does or doesn’t know. Those convinced Trump is being railroaded assume Mueller just keeps dragging out the investigation because he’s found nothing, while those convinced of his guilt assume Mueller is slowly and carefully building a case that will corner Trump.

I’ve been reluctant to get too far ahead of my skis in either proclaiming Trump’s innocence or declaring his guilt.

What’s made me particularly wary is that there has been a steady stream of stories that have been promoted as being “bombshells,” that either end up being corrected, and/or turn out upon further analysis and with the benefit of context, to be less dispositive than initially advertised.

A perfect example is the recent revelation in the New York Times that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort “shared political polling data with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence.”

When the news first broke, cries of “Wow!”; “OMG”; and “BOOM!” erupted on Twitter. CNN’s Chris Cillizza, a useful barometer of conventional wisdom, recounted the Times story and concluded, “That. Is. Huge.”

But was it? Not so fast, said none other than Benjamin Wittes, a close friend of former FBI director James Comey who called for Trump’s impeachment way back in 2017. Writing on his Lawfare blog, Wittes cautioned that the sharing of polling data could have just as easily been explained as being part of Manafort’s shady business dealings that involved peddling his ties to Trump rather than clear evidence of collusion.

“This is not to splash cold water on the story, which is certainly tantalizing,” Wittes wrote. “It is to say that Manafort's lawyers' general characterization of Mueller's allegations about Manafort's conduct in the context of a dispute over whether Manafort violated his plea agreement or not offers a highly imperfect window into Mueller's understanding of that evidence and how it fits into the larger picture of interactions between the Trump campaign and the Russian state.”

After Wittes wrote that, the Times issued an embarrassing correction, which further undermined the idea that the story demonstrated collusion. The story initially said that Manafort had wanted his Russian contact, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, to pass along the polling data to Oleg V. Deripaska, described as “a Russian oligarch close to the Kremlin.” However, the correction said that Manafort had actually asked for the data to be shared with two Ukranian oligarchs.

To be sure, the oligarchs are known to be Russia-friendly, so the correction does not necessarily disprove the idea that this had something to do with collusion. But it strengthens the case that it more likely has to do with Mueller’s investigations into Manafort’s business dealings.

At the same time, it’s quite possible, as some have suggested, that Mueller is holding his cards close to his vest, and actually has much more than he’s letting on. But there’s no way of knowing until it’s time for him to reveal his hand. In the meantime we’re just getting glimpses of random cards in the deck and speculating on the rest.

The speculation has been repeatedly wrong -- even when it comes to something as basic as whether the investigation is nearing its conclusion.

I support letting the Mueller investigation run its course. And when it does, I’ll be able to form an opinion. Until then, put me in the agnostic camp.

Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller probe, to leave post

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.

Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.

Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: HARTFORD - The honeymoon is just beginning for Ned Lamont.
So it was fitting that Connecticut's new governor, the well-connected telecommunications magnate, enlisted MSNBC newlyweds Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski of "Morning Joe" for the prime-time slot of a day of pomp, partying and people-watching.
The MSNBC power couple with state ties - she got her TV start at WVIT in Hartford, and he owned a home in New Canaan - helped the Democrat revel in the historic moment Wednesday night during the governor's inaugural ball at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford.
"Joe's a rock star," Lamont gushed. "Joe Scarborough left Florida to move to Connecticut."
Lamont was referring to Scarborough's six years as a member of Congress, before the vocal Trump critic left the Republican Party and migrated the opposite way of many of Connecticut's wealthy retirees.
Members of the political class - judges, appointees and lobbyists - swarmed around the stage as Scarborough's band played "Play That Funky Music White Boy."
"I've come a long way with Ned, who I've danced with," said Brzezinski, who chatted with former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi near the stage.
Nooyi, a Greenwich resident like Lamont, is a member of the governor's business council, a volunteer position.
About 2,000 revelers filled the cavernous convention center, many shelling out $200 to rub elbows with influencers and take in history. They dined on pheasant with foie gras and truffles, smothered oxtail, braised lamb shoulder with Anson Mills cheddar grits and mint gremolata, and boneless duck leg confit.
"Two thousand of his closest friends," House Republican leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby, said facetiously on her way into the ball.
It's tradition for the leaders of the party not in power to attend these kind of soirees, including this one, which was emceed by actor Christopher Meloni, a New Milford resident who starred in "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."
"He's from Tinseltown," Lamont said. "He could have been anywhere."
State Sen. George Logan, R-Ansonia, who survived November's blue wave that swept Lamont into office and plays in a Jimi Hendrix tribute band, did a cover of Hendrix's guitar version of the "Star Spangled Banner."
"Sen. Logan, I knew Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix was a friend of mine," Lamont said. "And sir, you're a kick-ass Jimi Hendrix."
Lamont was joined by his wife, Annie Lamont, and their three children. They were surrounded by an eclectic cast of characters throughout the day, from the stately House chamber where Lamont delivered his first State of the State address at the Capitol, to the glitzy governor's ball.
Under the golden dome of the Capitol earlier Wednesday, John Olsen and Ray Dalio sat side by side for Lamont's debut.
One is a face of organized labor and the Democratic machine in Connecticut. The other's net worth is $18.1 billion, making him far and away the state's wealthiest resident - a billionaire who hasn't decamped for Florida.
The juxtaposition wasn't lost on Olsen, a former state Democratic chairman and past president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, who grinned about the occurrence.
"It's kind of what's great about this country," a bemused Olsen said. "At the end of the day, we put on our pants one leg at a time."
Olsen probably owns pants that are older than Will Haskell, the freshman Democratic state senator from Westport, who nabbed the endorsement of Barack Obama and profiles by the New York Times and Time magazine. The 22-year-old bounded up the stairs of the Capitol on Wednesday, getting acclimated to his new honorific and surroundings.
"I'm still getting used to that," Haskell said of people addressing him as "senator." He gave Lamont high marks for the optimistic tone of his speech.
"I thought it was forward looking," he said.
Haskell brought his girlfriend, a law student, as his date to the governor's inaugural ball. Yes, he owns a tux.
"Whatever I wore to my prom, that's in my closet," Haskell said.

Texto completo: How old is too old? Joe Biden is 76 years old, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is 77. Two years from now, would either man be too old to be president? Not just physically, but culturally and temperamentally?
Donald Trump, though he was the oldest person (70) to be elected president, doesn't seem to have a problem with age, not so much because of his full head of dyed hair, but because he is strangely ageless. He is at once a vigorous old guy, a 28-year old Internet troll and an 11-year-old boy off his Ritalin.
Biden, though he can seem reassuringly mature at times, can also seem a little dated, like a character out of the 1950s. A year and a half after the Access Hollywood recording was released, during which Trump was caught using what he later described as "locker room talk," Biden, the former vice president, said he didn't want to debate Trump, but that he wanted to "take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him."
Biden was assailed in some quarters for "toxic masculinity," but really, he seemed at times a character out of an Archie and Jughead comic book.
Many older people such as me (I'm 67) feel out of step with the younger generation - probably because we are. We are insufficiently "woke," we can be uncomfortable with or just confused by the variations of gender fluidity, and we can find ourselves stifling a laugh at a politically incorrect joke.
Secretly, though, we think we are not just older, but wiser than the young people who are reported by polls to have socialistic leanings. How, we ask ourselves, can the country pay for free college tuition and universal Medicare?
When I was younger (35 years old), I helped popularize the notion that age and experience count for a great deal in government by co-authoring, with Walter Isaacson, a book called "The Wise Men." During the 1960s and 1970s, at times of crisis, presidents would bring in elder advisers, dubbed the "W.O.M." (Wise Old Men), to give them counsel. It was a meeting of WOMs in March 1968 that helped convince President Lyndon B. Johnson that the time had come to begin to draw down U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Five days later, Johnson announced peace talks and that he would not run for reelection. It was a moment of true statesmanship - to see old Cold Warriors such as former secretary of state Dean Acheson (age 74) and ambassador at large Averell Harriman (age 76) warning the president of the perils of American hubris.
So, when it comes to making tough calls in the Oval Office, is older wiser? Well, actually, maybe not. Older people can get stuck in their ways. They can be too confident in their judgments, and heedless of new facts.
The Wise Old Men who advised Johnson in 1968 to get out of Vietnam had earlier counseled the president to get into Vietnam. During the mid-1960s, they had warned Johnson not to listen to the antiwar protesters or go wobbly on the communists. During the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, President John F. Kennedy brought Dean into his group of close advisers. Acheson, whose hawkishness had hardened in old age, counseled the young president to take out the Soviet missiles with airstrikes. It's a good thing Kennedy didn't listen to Acheson, or we might all be radioactive dust now.
Old men (and old women) get worn out, mentally and physically, no matter how hard they try to stay vigorous and alert. In his mid-70s, President Ronald Reagan may have suffered from early dementia by the end of his second term.
By the end of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's second term - he was 70, at the time the oldest president ever - he was spending more time on his putting than dealing with the out-of-control mushrooming of the nuclear arsenal or the secret excesses of the CIA.
I recently thought about the burdens of age - the closed-mindedness and sheer fatigue - and the importance of younger and fresher perspectives in connection with the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan in August 1945. President Harry S. Truman's top civilian adviser was Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson. In later years, Stimson would be revered as a role model for a later generation of Wise Old Men.
But at a meeting of Truman's top war council in June 1945, Stimson, who was 77 years old, was exhausted. Suffering from a migraine, he had not slept well the night before. He barely spoke up. Instead, Stimson's aide, Jack McCloy, tried to argue that "we ought to have our heads examined" if the United States didn't try to induce the Japanese to surrender before dropping the bomb. McCloy suggested that instead of demanding unconditional surrender, the Allies should let Japan keep its emperor, a gambit that might have worked to avert Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The instance cried out for creative thinking, but no one in the room was ready to listen to the 40-year-old McCloy, who was deemed too young and brash.
So listen to your elders. But don't necessarily vote for them.

Sticking to some road diets as a New Year’s resolution

Texto completo: Speaking as only an occasional cyclist, occasional pedestrian — mostly just another exhaust-belching motorist — I was glad to see that the Orange Grove War had not permanently killed-by-carb-loading the idea for road diets in Pasadena.
As staffer Chris Lindahl’s recent story explained, small, smart plans for the ongoing evolution of Cordova Street with expanded bicycle lanes along with safer mid-street turn lanes for cars will continue even after the OG War almost split northeast Pasadena asunder.
Last year I rode my rather disused 30-year-old mountain bike along Orange Grove with some of the bicycle activists who were asking for just a little bit more life safety, please, along that race track-like commuting corridor. After doing so, and getting honked at and physically intimidated for no reason by people behind the wheels of tons of fast-moving steel, I agreed with the need for a road diet on the boulevard. (I also discovered that my bike badly needed a tune up, and took it in to Around The Cycle on Lincoln Avenue for some grease and a brake job.)
But as Star-News readers will recall, there was outrage about the God-given right to drive very fast in four lanes devoted solely to cars, and the proposed road diet was killed by a freaked-out City Hall in favor of the forever fat-man status quo.
The plan for Cordova — a nicely obscure east-wester convenient for getting you to various PCC and Caltech events that peters out at its western terminus by dead-ending at Arroyo Parkway, making it less crowded than Del Mar, California and other neighboring streets — has been in the works for a decade. Community meetings held. Changes that will make it safer for pedestrians, including disabled walkers, to get across the street are in the works. Some lanes for non-turning cars will be lost — so what? The street, just like Orange Grove, is never bumper-to-bumper with them.
And yet, at least so far, drivers’ organizations are not screaming bloody murder.
So, contrary to most things these dire days, not every sensible notion in the world is being, well, thrown under the bus.
The Tournament of Toys:
Thank you so much, all you donors to the Charles Cherniss Tournament of Toys! I am once again blown away by the incredible generosity of readers sustaining this Star-News charity that provides books and the money to buy books and toys given to hundreds of San Gabriel Valley children by the Pasadena Jaycees’ Operation Santa each Christmas Eve. The huge box of children’s books brought to the office by Tamara Silver — who several years ago came up with the idea of expanding from toys — was a beautiful sight. In fact, though my child is 28 this month and I have little excuse for kid lit, it caused me to pull out from her pile Roald Dahl’s “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” which I only knew from Wes Anderson’s movie, and which is … fantastic. With drawings by the fox-sly Quentin Blake. Tamara: a peach! As are the aforementioned Beverly Reid, first donor, and many others, including: Ethel Miller; Rary Simmons; Janet Capanna; Sharon and Steve Giannotta; John Taylor, in memory of Chuck Cherniss; Alice Huang and David Baltimore; Marianne and John Spielmann; Susan and Paul Holman; Laura Jacobsen; Katherine Wilson; James Gruettner; Sharon Plotkin; Peggy Ebright; and the dynamic Maggi Cherniss (93 now, she notes) and her daughter Rebecca Ford. Readers donated over $1,700 to the CCToT over the last month, and we and the Jaycees are ever so appreciative.
Wednesday at random:
The New York Times got to the Rose Bowl this year, hot and bothered. Its sportswriter Marc Tracy noted that one of the things standing in the way of college football expanding its four-team playoff system to six or eight teams is precisely the ongoing popularity of the Granddaddy of Them All. Where would the Rose Bowl Game fit in that future? Tracy found an Ohio fan who had won tickets to the RBG in a bar raffle who “lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating” at Brookside. Yes, it’s just Pac-12 vs. Big Ten, but some of us like it that way.
National champs? That’s too newfangled and has little tradition going for it.
Ohio State, the fan noted, is “the winner of the Rose Bowl!”

Iran Confirms Arrest of U.S. Navy Veteran; Charges aren't disclosed, but Foreign Ministry spokesman says Tehran told U.S. of Michael White's detention shortly after it happened

Texto completo: Iran said it has arrested a U.S. Navy veteran on charges it didn't disclose, a move that threatens to further strain relations between Washington and Tehran after the Trump administration reimposed sanctions last year on the Islamic Republic.
Bahram Ghasemi, the spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry, on Wednesday said the U.S. was informed of Michael White's arrest shortly after it happened, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Mr. Ghasemi denied unspecified reports that Mr. White had been treated poorly while in detention.
"The case of this individual is being processed by the appropriate channels, and when it is concluded, the concerned authorities will inform [the public] about it," he was quoted as saying.
Iran has a history of arresting people with foreign ties and using them as political bargaining chips, often charging them with spying or spreading propaganda against the Iranian system. The country released four Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, after the U.S. and five other world powers agreed to the nuclear deal Iran four years ago. The U.S. dropped charges against seven Iranians accused of violating U.S. sanctions in exchange.
Since the nuclear deal, which President Trump backed out of in May, Iran has detained several more Americans, including Princeton University doctoral candidate Xiyue Wang, and sentenced a father and son with dual Iranian-American citizenship to 10-year terms for allegedly spying and collaborating with Iran's enemies.
Another American, former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Robert Levinson, disappeared almost 12 years ago while on an island off Iran's southern coast. Iranian authorities have claimed no knowledge of his whereabouts.
News of Mr. White's case emerged on Monday, when IranWire, a website founded by a prominent Iranian-Canadian journalist, published an article quoting a man formerly held in the same prison as saying Mr. White had been there since last summer.
He was described as a former U.S. Navy officer in his mid-40s from California whom the authorities arrested as he and his Iranian girlfriend tried to leave the country from Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city. Mr. White had traveled to Iran two other times without incident to see the woman, whom he met online, IranWire reported.
A subsequent New York Times report quoted Mr. White's mother as saying she learned late last year that her son had been detained in Iran in July. He suffered from acute asthma and had been treated for a neck tumor, she was quoted as saying.
The State Department was aware of reports that a U.S. citizen was detained in Iran, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.
"We have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad," the spokesperson said.
U.S. relations with Iran have been on an uneven footing since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the ensuing Iran hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans were held for more than a year.
Despite that fraught history, the Obama administration joined China, Russia and European countries in attempting to thaw ties through the nuclear deal, which gave Iran relief from international sanctions in exchange for new curbs on its disputed nuclear program.
Relations worsened again after Mr. Trump made an about-face, returning to a policy of containing and sanctioning Iran following his withdrawal from the nuclear deal.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is visiting leaders across the Middle East this week in a bid to build support for efforts to counter Iran, and to reassure allies of the U.S.'s commitment to fighting terror after Mr. Trump's recent decision to pull troops from Syria.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmentalist from California, said Wednesday he wouldn't seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, focusing instead on his multimillion-dollar effort to impeach President Trump.
Mr. Steyer said during an appearance in Iowa, the home of the nation's first presidential caucuses, that he would spend at least $40 million in 2019 to promote efforts to impeach the president. He said his plan would include town-hall meetings across the nation and an "impeachment summit" in Washington, D.C., in late January, all aimed at mobilizing millions of people to press for the president's impeachment.
"This is the biggest issue in American politics today," Mr. Steyer said in a statement. "We have a lawless president in the White House who is eroding our democracy, and it is only going to get worse."
The Steyer-backed Need to Impeach, which was launched in October 2017, plans to focus some of its attention on supporters who live in House districts held by Democratic lawmakers who lead committees with investigative powers, including Reps. Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters of California, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Jerrold Nadler of New York and Elijah Cummings of Maryland.
Mr. Steyer's plans were first reported by the New York Times.
Mr. Steyer, 61 years old, was among a small group of wealthy businessmen considering entering the 2020 Democratic primaries, and he could have spent millions of dollars of his own money in the race.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently visited Iowa and has expressed interest in joining the race. The field could also include former Starbucks CEO and Chairman Howard Schultz.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro have launched exploratory campaigns but the field is expected to grow as a number of lawmakers and governors make their intentions known.
Mr. Steyer, a hedge-fund manager and philanthropist, has devoted tens of millions of dollars to a number of causes, including climate change and efforts to engage young voters. He had previously considered a run for California governor but has focused instead on environmental issues and impeaching Mr. Trump.

The Great Molasses Flood of 1919 was Boston's strangest disaster

Texto completo: Hollywood has made movies starring all manner of disasters, from rogue tornadoes and invading aliens to giant solar flares that fry the earth. But even the masters of make-believe haven't conceived of anything as strange — or strangely devastating — as what happened that afternoon in January 1919.
One hundred years later, it's a calamity that still seems as darkly comical as it is unimaginable: A 15-foot wave of molasses raced — yes, raced — through Boston's North End. But what sounds like a B movie directed by Roger Corman is no joke: Twenty-one people died and dozens more were badly injured. Unsuspecting men, women, and children were smothered — asphyxiated, really — by a tsunami of viscous brown syrup, and when the bodies were finally recovered, the Suffolk County medical examiner said they looked “as though covered in heavy oil skins . . . eyes and ears, mouths and noses filled."
Any trace of the tragedy's gummy residue has long since been scrubbed from the neighborhood's narrow streets, but a small, easy-to-overlook plaque at Commercial Street and Copp's Hill Terrace marks the spot where a towering steel tank containing 2.3 million gallons of molasses suddenly ruptured, releasing a torrent of syrup that strangled and destroyed everything in its path in a matter of minutes.
The story of the bizarre and deadly deluge has been oft told over the years — Stephen Puleo's meticulously researched 2003 book, Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919, is the definitive account — but somehow the event is still unfamiliar even to many North End residents, nevermind all those rubberneckers shuffling down Hanover Street looking for the Paul Revere House or Regina Pizzeria.
“The molasses flood got huge press coverage at the time, but then it faded from public memory," says Liz Nelson Weaver, a member of Friends of the Boston Harborwalk, a volunteer group that's won approval to install a more “engaging, interpretative" sign about the flood.
“It was an awful thing that happened," Weaver says. “The fact that it tends to be turned into a ha-ha story does an incredible disservice to the people who lost their lives."
And yet, we're talking about molasses, the otherwise innocuous treacle used to give batters and gingerbread a brown cast and a quality chew. The gooey byproduct of refined sugarcane was much in demand during World War I because it could be converted to industrial alcohol, a critical ingredient in the manufacture of munitions. In 1915, the Purity Distilling Company had built a holding tank some 50-feet tall on Commercial Street, choosing the location for its proximity to Boston Harbor — molasses arrived from Puerto Rico and points south — and to the nearby railroad tracks that shuttled the sugary ooze to the manufacturing plant in Cambridge.
But in its haste to construct the tank — in a precinct populated, not coincidentally, by poor Italian immigrants powerless to prevent such a thing  from being shoehorned into their neighborhood — the company's profit-hungry bosses dispensed with tests that would have revealed the structure's lethal flaws.
The result was predictable. Indeed, signs of trouble appeared almost immediately in the form of dark, pearly streaks of molasses that ran down the sides of the monstrous tank. Street urchins greedily scraped up the gunk, using sticks to make primitive lollipops. But instead of inspecting the tank, the owners merely painted it brown to disguise the leaks. Residents and passersby also reported hearing a peculiar groaning sound coming from the mammoth cauldron long before it erupted.
Just after noon on January 15, 1919, with the sun high in the sky and temperatures topping 40 degrees, the tank failed spectacularly, coming apart like a wet paper bag and sending a wall of molasses roaring through the neighborhood. Moving at a rate of 50 feet per second, the rising tide leveled buildings and buckled the steel girders of the elevated railway, overwhelming everything and everyone in its wake, including 10-year-old Pasquale Iantosca, who was struck and killed by a train car swept from the tracks.
“Think of it," says Puleo, the author of Dark Tide. “This giant wave hits. People drowned or were killed by debris. Others were horribly injured — fractured skulls and broken backs — and 25 horses were killed."
It was a hideous scene, and when the temperature plunged overnight, the dead became entombed in the hardened sugar, forcing frantic workers to use saws and chisels to clear wreckage and retrieve bodies. The rescue effort was painstaking and protracted. Flaminio Gallerani's body was discovered 11 days after the spill, while the body of Cesare Nicolo, a wagon driver, wouldn't be found for another four months, pulled from the water under Commercial Wharf.
More than 100 lawsuits were filed against the United States Industrial Alcohol Company, the owner of Purity Distilling, whose lawyers tried, perhaps cynically, to blame Italian anarchists for the disaster, claiming that radicals had bombed the tank. But the judge wasn't buying it. The accident, he ruled, was the result of shoddy design and construction — the same type of brittle steel had been used on the Titanic, which sank seven years before the flood — and USIA was ordered to pay about $630,000 in settlements.
Though small consolation to the families of the victims, the verdict prompted Boston, and many other US cities and towns, to tighten laws regulating development.
“The molasses flood did for building construction standards what the Cocoanut Grove fire did for fire safety," says Puleo.
 Over time, the molasses flood has become a subject of weird fascination for amateur sleuths and academics. In 2016, students taking an Introduction to Fluid Dynamics class at Harvard studied the effects of the weather that day, concluding that the 13,000 tons of tacky sweetener spread rapidly because it was warm from the tank, but then stiffened quickly in the cold air, impeding rescuers and costing lives.
While it's largely unknown to folks outside of Boston, the unnatural disaster surfaces from time to time in popular culture. Author Dennis Lehane's 2008 novel, The Given Day, a Prohibition-era tale of bad cops, Brahmins, and feisty broads, includes a memorable scene of the molasses flood, and Comedy Central's Drunk History produced an amusing — and more or less historically accurate — mockumentary about the tragedy.
Then there's Francine Pellegrino, who spent the past two decades writing a musical about the sticky situation. A New York native who lives in Boston, Pellegrino says she fell in love with the North End long ago, enchanted by its cobblestone streets and the tantalizing aroma of olives and artichoke hearts that lingers in the air. She was working on a stage production about one of the neighborhood's many immigrant families when someone mentioned the events of 1919.
“I thought it was a made-up story," she says. “But the more I read — about how everyone knew the tank was going to burst and no one did anything about it — I wanted to incorporate it."
Called Molasses in January, Pellegrino's musical had a two-month Off Broadway run last spring at The Theater Center. But on a tiny stage, and constrained by an even tinier budget, she couldn't quite re-create the catastrophic flood.
“We turned the lights off and had people screaming, and then turned the lights on and had people laying down on stage," she says.
Puleo, meanwhile, has been busy with speaking engagements timed to the spill's centennial. In case you're wondering, yes, Dark Tide has been optioned by a Hollywood producer, but Puleo's not sure if his book will ever make it to the big screen.
“To do this thing justice, the special effects would be really costly," he says.
And, really, would anyone believe it anyway?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who has tried for two years to steady a rocky Justice Department and its tumultuous relationship with the White House, plans to leave the job in coming weeks, people familiar with his thinking said Wednesday, raising the stakes for the confirmation process of President Trump's attorney general nominee, William Barr .
There is no timeline for Mr. Rosenstein's departure but he is expected to leave after Mr. Barr is in place, the people said, stressing that he isn't being forced out as the department's second-in-command and has long planned to leave after two years. Mr. Rosenstein's oversight of the special counsel's Russia investigation made him a target of Mr. Trump's criticism and the highest-profile deputy attorney general in recent history.
Mr. Barr, whose confirmation hearing begins Tuesday, sought to assure lawmakers Wednesday that he would protect Robert Mueller's probe into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election, an early recognition of the pressure he would come up against as head of an institution that has faced sustained attacks from Mr. Trump.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Mr. Barr told him he saw no immediate reason to end Mr. Mueller's investigation, despite having written a 20-page memo last year sharply criticizing certain aspects of it.
"I asked Mr. Barr directly if he thinks Mr. Mueller is on a witch hunt, and he said 'no,'" Mr. Graham told reporters, referring to Mr. Trump's frequent characterization of the probe. "I can assure you he has a very high opinion of Mr. Mueller and is committed to letting Mr. Mueller finish his job."
Mr. Graham also depicted Messrs. Barr and Mueller as closer than had been previously widely known. "Their wives are in a Bible study together. I think they are best friends," he said. "I think Mr. Mueller has been to two of [Mr. Barr's] daughters' weddings."
With Republicans holding a majority in the Senate, Mr. Barr is expected to be confirmed next week following a two-day hearing, during which Democrats have vowed to press him on the Russia investigation and his sweeping views of presidential power.
Mr. Barr would succeed Matthew Whitaker, who has been serving as acting attorney general since Mr. Trump ousted Jeff Sessions in November. At that time Mr. Whitaker assumed formal oversight of the Russia probe, though Mr. Rosenstein has been regularly apprised of its progress.
Wednesday's developments underscored a central question underlying the transition under way at the Justice Department: Can Mr. Barr, who previously served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, stabilize an agency that has been buffeted by departures, criticism and political storms?
"Barr is in a good position," said Robert Litt, a top Justice Department official in the Clinton administration. "Going in, he will have a significant amount of support from people willing to give him the opportunity to show he respects the career people."
"The question is," he added, "what does he do to deal with the dissatisfaction people are feeling?"
Mr. Barr, a respected figure in the legal and corporate worlds, would return to a Justice Department very different from the one he left in 1993. From a management perspective, the attorney general now plays a much bigger role in national security. In political terms, he would have to manage relations with a mercurial president who has often inserted himself into the department's traditionally independent operations.
Mr. Barr's nomination was met with some relief among many Justice Department officials, who view him as a more conventional figure than some other candidates for the post. Mr. Rosenstein's planned departure adds an element of uncertainty to the agency's already depleted upper ranks, however, and it isn't clear what Mr. Barr's arrival would mean for Mr. Whitaker's future at the Justice Department.
Mr. Barr agreed to serve as Mr. Trump's attorney general only under certain conditions, including that he be able to pick his own deputy, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Graham said Mr. Barr told him he already has someone in mind for the post.
At a dinner with Mr. Barr around the time Mr. Trump tapped him for the top Justice post, Mr. Rosenstein told Mr. Barr he would move on once Mr. Barr was confirmed and would help with the transition, for which Mr. Barr said he was grateful, a person familiar with the conversation said.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed Mr. Rosenstein wasn't forced out and was helping make room for Mr. Barr's team.

"We hope that that happens relatively soon," she said.
Mr. Rosenstein faced an usually bright spotlight as deputy attorney general, largely because of his oversight of the Russia probe. He supervised that inquiry after Mr. Sessions recused himself in light of his work on the Trump campaign.
That recusal destroyed Mr. Sessions' relationship with the president, leaving Mr. Rosenstein to cultivate ties to the White House and navigate some of the department's most politically charged issues.
Despite having previously served as Maryland's U.S. attorney under both Democratic and Republican administrations, Mr. Rosenstein saw his reputation as an apolitical prosecutor tested early. At Mr. Trump's request, he wrote a memo that the White House cited as grounds for firing former FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.
Mr. Trump later used that memo to attack Mr. Rosenstein's oversight of the Mueller probe. "I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!" he tweeted.
Questions regularly arose during Mr. Rosenstein's tenure about his own job security. In September, his departure seemed all but certain following reports that he had discussed secretly recording the president and sought his removal from office. He strongly denied those allegations.
Mr. Rosenstein often said he was frustrated that his focus on drugs, guns, gangs and violent crime was overshadowed by the Russia probe. The people familiar with his thinking said on Wednesday he felt he had made important progress in those areas, even while public attention was elsewhere.

High Tax Rates Aren't Optimal

Texto completo: Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, wears his learning lightly in his New York Times column, all the better apparently to focus on his real purpose: characterizing anyone associated with "the right" as an evil idiot.
This week he leapt to the defense of Democratic freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's idea of paying for a "Green New Deal" with a 70% marginal tax rate on the incomes of top earners.
Now your intuition might be that neurosurgeons and other highly paid folk would work less if the government took 70% of the proceeds. Or that lobbyists and politicians would find it remunerative to arrange loopholes on behalf of these taxpayers, which would also negate the hoped-for revenues.
But Mr. Krugman cites studies that suggest these effects are negligible. The superfluous earnings of these taxpayers aren't really so valued by themselves or by society. A 2011 paper by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez, based on a variety of extrapolations, calculates that the "optimal" top tax rate is 73%. A paper the same year by Christina and David Romer finds an even higher "revenue maximizing" top tax rate of 84%.
Case closed? Not even slightly. Messrs. Saez and Diamond are describing a world in which the wealthy have no opportunity to shield or hide their incomes. Look closely and the authors' "optimal" top federal rate quickly becomes 48% in a tax code like America's when state taxes are included.
And not even the Romers are convinced by their 84% top rate. Their study looks only at interwar tax returns, when the tiny number of relevant taxpayers received mostly partnership and dividend income. Their work tells us nothing about an 84% rate's impact on labor effort in an economy like today's.
They also point out that some of their data are "imperfect" and the results "perverse." To wit, did the rich in the 1920s and '30s really spend more on machinery and equipment even as the tax hit went up, yet at the same time form fewer new businesses?
Their findings, they add, may be "confounded by the enormous shocks affecting the economy over this period" (war, inflation, deflation, depression). And their results fly in the face of "comparable postwar studies" that find significant detrimental effects from high marginal tax rates. On second thought, their own study may find such effects too if their discovery of reduced business incorporations in the 1920s and '30s "holds up under further scrutiny."
You would hardly call this a strong basis for junking the well-established principle that 80 is more than 20, and prospective earners and taxpayers treat it as such.
In fact, the Romers are right: A large and growing literature continues to support the claim that high marginal tax rates and big tax hikes are harmful to economic well-being. See the work of the Dallas Fed's Karel Mertens and colleagues, or the Romers' own 2010 work finding a "highly contractionary" effect from postwar tax hikes.
The theoretical cases for towering "optimal" tax rates that Mr. Krugman cites always tend to trip up over political realities if nothing else. Politicians may find it politically handy to be seen dinging the rich, but they also find it useful to placate the rich by dishing out loopholes. The net result isn't more revenue. It's more efficiency-inhibiting economic distortions.
We would also appeal to a simple, real-world intuition. Take Mr. Krugman's suggested 70% rate on incomes over $1 million. If it were really possible to fatten government spending annually by as much as $650 billion (to use 2016 tax data) without killing the golden goose, we have to believe U.S. politicians would be doing so already.
Ditto Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's proposal to tax only income above $10 million at 70%, which might theoretically yield $224 billion. Except all evidence suggests that the richest taxpayers are the most diligent about mobilizing lobbyists and politicians to finagle the tax code on their behalf.
The new congresswoman from Queens is to be admired for a plan that would hit her party's own blue-state voters hardest. But let's remember why we're having this discussion. Even $224 billion falls short of the estimated $1 trillion to $2 trillion in annual spending necessary to stabilize atmospheric CO2 by midcentury.
Her defenders will hasten to point out that she speaks only of zeroing out U.S. emissions, albeit by 2030. But U.S. emissions are only a 15% share (and shrinking) of the global total. Unless she has a plan for the rest of the world, her Green New Deal is self-refuting. She'd have the U.S. spending $224 billion annually to have no meaningful effect on climate.
But we digress. The real purpose of revisiting the alleged optimality of high marginal tax rates right now lies elsewhere. The goal is to make the spending plans of the ultraliberals sound plausible enough to lure millennial voters off the couch and into the voting booth. Like the young everywhere, they are excited by radical proposals as long as somebody else is paying.

Resumen: Section 2808 gives the defense secretary the authority to undertake military construction projects ‘not otherwise authorized by law’ to support any troops deployed in a national emergency requiring the use of the armed forces. According to a congressional aide, there is about $10 billion left in unobligated funds for military construction in the current fiscal year’s defense budget, in addition to some $13 billion that has rolled over from previous years. The Pentagon’s leadership would be forced to decide which of the projects in various stages of completion should see their funds diverted or cut, according to the congressional aide and a defense official. Since taking office two years ago, Trump has touted his commitment to increasing military spending.

Texto completo: In late March 2018, President Donald Trump and then-Defense Secretary James Mattis discussed the idea that the U.S. military could help the president achieve one of his cherished aims: The Pentagon would build a wall across the country’s southern border.
“Securing Americans and securing the nation is of paramount importance to the secretary,” the Pentagon press secretary at the time, Dana White, said of the discussions with Trump. “They have talked about it, but I don’t have any more details as to specifics.”
In the weeks and months that followed, a variety of reports seemed to raise questions about whether the U.S. military was in any position to be dedicating money or personnel to a border wall. There was, for instance, an April 2018 Government Accountability Office report wondering whether the military even had adequate data to assess its own state of combat readiness.
In October, there came a more sweeping report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. In its 2019 “Index of U.S. Military Strength,” what the foundation bills as its comprehensive annual assessment of America’s military power, the organization concluded: “As currently postured, the U.S. military is only marginally able to meet the demands of defending America’s vital national interests.”
Among the report’s highlights:
*
The Air Force and Marine Corps both received “weak” readiness ratings, with the Air Force mired in a crippling shortage of fighter pilots (more than 1,000) and fighter aircraft (nearly 300). The average fighter pilot is currently flying fewer than two times a week, severely degrading combat readiness of the force.
*
Of the U.S. Army’s 31 brigade combat teams, the building blocks of American ground combat power, only 15 are considered “ready” and only eight of those are “fully ready.” Army leaders have said it could be 2022 before the service gets to its goal of two-thirds of its active BCTs ready.
*
The Marine Corps maintained its 2018 “weak” comprehensive rating, with approximately half of its amphibious ship and tactical aircraft fleets unavailable for current operations.
In the Heritage Foundation’s news release about the report, Tom Spoehr, director of the Center for National Defense and a retired Army lieutenant general, said: “There can be no doubt — the U.S. military is still too small, insufficiently ready, and under-modernized. Despite recent, much-needed increases in the defense budget, rebuilding will take years. The consistent theme across the services has been one of degraded readiness, outdated equipment and overburdened service members.”
The state of America’s military readiness is no abstract question. A year before the 2018 Heritage Foundation report on military strength, the Navy suffered back-to-back disasters when 17 sailors died in two accidents involving destroyers in the vaunted Seventh Fleet. The state of the fleet’s readiness came in for withering critiques in the aftermath of the accidents.
“In general, we’re asking too few ships to do too many things,” Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said at a meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee after the Navy produced a series of reports on the fatal accidents.
John McCain, the Republican Arizona senator who died last year, said, according to a report in The New York Times: “We’ve deprived them of the funds to do it. We’re putting those men and women in harm’s way to be wounded or killed because we refuse to give them the sufficient training and equipment and readiness. It’s a failure of Congress. It’s on us.”
There are, of course, competing cases for what the U.S. military most needs, and more money isn’t the be-all and end-all.
Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator and all-but-declared candidate for the presidency in 2020, made such a case in an essay recently in Foreign Affairs magazine.
“The United States will spend more than $700 billion on defense in the 2018–19 fiscal year alone,” she wrote. “That is more in real terms than was spent under President Ronald Reagan during the Cold War and more than all the rest of the country’s discretionary budget put together. But even as Washington spends more and more, U.S. military leaders point out that funding a muscular military without robust diplomacy, economic statecraft, support for civil society, and development assistance only hamstrings American national power and undercuts any military gains.”
The wisdom of the military taking responsibility for building a southern border wall is front and center again. Trump is scheduled to address the nation Tuesday night, and he is said to be considering declaring a national emergency in order to make way for the military to build the wall.
A report in The Washington Post on Monday laid out what might happen if Trump moves forward with this:

The president’s suggestion that he can build the wall by declaring a national emergency would likely hinge on a little-known section of the U.S. Code governing the military. Section 2808 gives the defense secretary the authority to undertake military construction projects ‘not otherwise authorized by law’ to support any troops deployed in a national emergency requiring the use of the armed forces.
The law limits the spending in such cases. The Pentagon can draw upon only the money that Congress has appropriated for military construction projects but which has yet to be committed by contract to projects. These are known as unobligated funds. Sometimes, they are not all spent.
According to a congressional aide, there is about $10 billion left in unobligated funds for military construction in the current fiscal year’s defense budget, in addition to some $13 billion that has rolled over from previous years. The money, however, has been appropriated for specific projects. This aide, and another one, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.
The Pentagon’s leadership would be forced to decide which of the projects in various stages of completion should see their funds diverted or cut, according to the congressional aide and a defense official.

Since taking office two years ago, Trump has touted his commitment to increasing military spending. A budget Trump signed into law committed $700 billion in 2018 and $716 billion in 2019 to the Defense Department. The figures represent about a $100 billion bump from 2017. In a tweet, Trump declared that “our military is again rich.”
Even then, he seemed to be keen on the military using its alleged riches to get involved in the wall.
In the final line of his tweet saluting how flush he said the military was, Trump wrote, “Build WALL through M!”
Will Fischer, director of government relations for VoteVets, a liberal veterans advocacy group, said he thought any military involvement in the construction of a border wall would have consequences for the Pentagon’s state of readiness.
“Once again, the military is being used as a prop,” Fischer said, adding he thought their only priority ought to be “training for the fight at hand, for real threats.”

The Taking
The federal government’s boldest land grab in a generation produced the first border wall — and a trail of abuse, mistakes and unfairness.
However, Gordon Adams, professor emeritus at the School of International Service at American University who was the senior White House budget official for national security from 1993 to 1997, said he doubted any military commitment to building the wall would have a direct effect on readiness.
“I don’t think it will be done by the military; they won’t deploy active-duty military,” Adams said. “The way it’ll work in the real world is it will probably be the Army Corps of Engineers that oversees it and the private contractors doing it.
Adams said the Pentagon typically had $15 billion or $20 billion “worth of balances” for projects like building bases, barracks or testing facilities.
“They would have to determine of all the funds assigned to projects, which of these can we reasonably defer,” he said. “It’d be a very indirect impact. The department always has a backlog of things it wants to build and repair. It never builds and repairs all the things it wants to build and repair, but it chugs along.”
Mattis, at the time of the budget signing, was also excited about the money available — but mainly for rebuilding lost capacity.
“We do intend to get the planes back in the air, fully staffed squadrons back in the air, ships back to sea and the new gear built,” Mattis said to reporters.
“It’ll take years,” he added.
The country may be about to find out what effect the military building a wall has on its effort to rebuild its fighting power.

ESPN apologizes for using 'Dixie' during Luck playoff game graphic

Texto completo: ESPN issued an apology Sunday after it used "Dixie" the day before in a graphic about the pass protection for Colts quarterback Andrew Luck. The network reportedly blamed the use of the song, widely associated with pro-Confederacy sentiment, on a production staffer.
The graphic was shown during Saturday's Colts-Texans playoff game, in which Luck led Indianapolis to a 21-7 win. Appearing to play off the popular Twitter account "Capt. Andrew Luck," in which the quarterback is portrayed as a Civil War officer to humorous effect, ESPN had the Colts star dodging cannon balls while clad in Union military garb.
Among the incongruous elements of the graphic was that soldiers protecting Luck's character were wearing the gray uniforms of the Confederacy. Some observers found the use of "Dixie" odd, if not offensive, because Indiana fought on the Union side of the Civil War and lost more than 25,000 out of approximately 200,000 from the state who served in battle.
"It was a mistake to use this song. We regret having done so and we apologize," ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz said in a statement to Michael McCarthy of Sporting News.
According to historian Christian McWhirter, via a 2012 essay for the New York Times, "Dixie" was written in 1859 by a Northerner for a minstrel show, and although its lyrics after the first verse are not overtly pro-South - they involve an array of "minstrel cliches," as McWhirter put it - the chorus proclaims, "I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray!/In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand/to live and die in Dixie."
"In contrast to the Union's anthem, 'Battle Hymn of the Republic,' invoking God's wrath, 'Dixie' is sentimental and elegiac, recalling this land of cotton fields and buckwheat cakes and a kind of slow-moving world that can seem appealing through rose-colored glasses," Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Tony Horwitz, author of "Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War," told NPR last year. "[It] speaks to a bygone, slow-paced world that some white Southerners felt had been snuffed out by a brutish, industrial North. And it was another way of steering memory away from slavery, toward a war between what Southerners call 'a different way of life.' "
Horwitz noted that "Dixie" was "part of the score of "Birth of a Nation," the movie that helped revive the Ku Klux Klan" and was "embraced by the segregationist Dixiecrats in the 1940s." Soon after gaining popularity in the North, the song caught on in the South and became the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy.
For decades, "Dixie" was played by the University of Mississippi's marching band at football games and other events until the school ended that practice in 2016, citing a goal of "making sure we follow our creed, core values of the athletic department, and that all people feel welcome." On Saturday and into Sunday as Twitter users responded to the ESPN's posting of the graphic, some objected to its usage by the network.
According to McCarthy, a source at ESPN said that "Dixie" was not part of the graphic when it was conceived and approved. Instead, the song was "dropped into the piece at the last moment by a staffer in the production truck," per McCarthy's source, who claimed that the network spoke with the staffer but would not disclose what came of that discussion.

Texto completo: AstraZeneca PLC has appointed Jose Baselga, a prominent cancer doctor, to lead oncology research and development as part of a wider overhaul to get drugs to market faster.
His appointment Monday comes just months after Dr. Baselga, 59 years old, resigned from a string of top positions -- including chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. -- for sometimes failing to disclose his ties with the drug industry in academic journal articles.
AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in an interview that the company's chief ethics officer was satisfied that these omissions were accidental, as Dr. Baselga has maintained since his failures were highlighted in a New York Times report in September.
"There is no excuse, and I acknowledge that," Dr. Baselga said in an interview, adding that failure to disclose industry ties was an issue for lots of authors of academic papers.
Authors are required to state potential conflicts of interest, but rules vary among journals on the extent of disclosure required. Dr. Baselga has acted as a paid adviser to several drugmakers at various times.
Astra hopes that Dr. Baselga's credentials will help it beat rivals in the rapidly evolving, increasingly competitive market for cancer drugs.
The success of its new cancer drugs are in large part responsible for a turnaround at AstraZeneca, which last year returned to growth after years of declining sales because of several patent expirations.
Dr. Baselga's role at AstraZeneca is part of an overhaul aimed at simplifying the company's structure. He will be in charge of cancer-drug development from start to finish, replacing a structure where early-stage research and late-stage clinical trials were managed separately.
AstraZeneca has also created a single research-and-development unit for its other focus areas: cardiovascular and respiratory medicine, which will be led by Mene Pangalos, previously head of early-stage research and development. Both research-and- development units will have their own dedicated sales organizations.
The overhaul announced Monday closely follows the departures of two high-profile executives whose roles would have been eliminated by the reorganization: Bahija Jallal, who is taking up the helm at British biotech Immunocore, and Mark Mallon, who is to become chief executive of Cambridge, Mass.-based Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Dr. Soriot said their departures weren't driven by the reorganization, but that they did affect the timing. "It's clear that this reorganization has been considered for some time," he said. "The departures gave us the opportunity to implement it now." The changes will also affect a number of other leadership positions at the company, he said, but that the vast majority of staff won't be affected.

Second man is found dead at donor's home; Democratic political figure Ed Buck faced an inquiry in the fatal OD of another man at his residence in 2017.

Texto completo: A man's body was found early Monday in the West Hollywood home of prominent Democratic donor Ed Buck, authorities said.
It was the second time a man was found dead at Buck's apartment. Buck is a longtime political donor, a onetime West Hollywood City Council candidate and a well-known figure in LGBTQ political circles.
Deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's West Hollywood station responded to the Laurel Avenue apartment complex at 1:05 a.m. in response to a report of a person not breathing, the department said in a statement. At some point, the 911 caller performed CPR, the department said.

Paramedics pronounced a man dead at the scene. The cause of death was not yet known.
The dead man's name has not been released, but Nicole Nishida, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Department, said he was black.
Buck previously was investigated for the death of another black man, the 2017 overdose of Gemmel Moore, 26.
Buck was present for the deaths of both men, the Sheriff's Department said Monday.
Buck's attorney, Seymour Amster, said Buck was not arrested and is cooperating with investigators.
"From what I know, it was an old friend who died of an accidental overdose, and unfortunately, we believe that the substance was ingested at some place other than the apartment," Amster said. "The person came over intoxicated."
Sheriff's homicide investigators are "conducting a thorough investigation" of the most recent death and will do "follow-up interviews and a secondary review" of Moore's death, the department said.
Capt. Chris Bergner of the sheriff's homicide bureau said his detectives again will be "working very closely with the district attorney's office" and will be "carefully examining all the evidence."
Moore died of a methamphetamine overdose in Buck's apartment in July 2017, according to a Los Angeles County coroner's report. Paramedics found him naked on a mattress in the living room, which was littered with drug para- phernalia, the report said.
Moore's mother, LaTisha Nixon of Texas, and his friends questioned whether Buck's ties to elected officials and differences in race and class influenced the investigation and whether the drugs that killed him were self-administered.
Moore had been homeless and had worked as an escort. Buck, 64, is white.
The coroner ruled Moore's death an accident, and an initial review by sheriff's deputies found nothing suspicious. But the following month, homicide detectives launched a new investigation.
Prosecutors this summer declined to file charges against Buck, citing insufficient evidence, according to court records. In a charge evaluation worksheet dated July 26, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said that the "admissible evidence is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that suspect Buck furnished drugs to Gemmel Moore or that suspect Buck possessed drugs."
The document also cited an inadmissible search and seizure but did not provide details.
The district attorney's office reviewed and rejected four charges: murder, voluntary manslaughter, and furnishing and possessing drugs.
Moore had flown from Houston to Los Angeles the day he died, according to coroner's investigators. Moore's mother said Buck bought his airplane ticket.
The Times reviewed pages of a journal that authorities said was found among Moore's possessions. In it, Moore purportedly wrote in 2016 about using crystal methamphetamine.
"I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that," Moore purportedly wrote. "Ed Buck is the one to thank, he gave me my first injection of chrystal [sic] meth."
The entry continues: "I just hope the end result isn't death.... If it didn't hurt so bad I'd kill myself but I'll let Ed Buck do it for now."
According to the coroner's report, an investigator found the following items in Buck's two-bedroom apartment: 24 syringes with brown residue, five glass pipes with white residue and burn marks, a plastic straw with possible white residue, clear plastic bags with white powdery residue and a clear plastic bag with a "piece of crystal-like substance."
West Hollywood Councilman John D'Amico on Monday said he asked the city manager to contact the sheriff and push for an investigation after the latest death.
"I have no further comment at this time. I'm going to let the D.A. and LASD do their jobs," D'Amico said.
Councilwoman Lindsey Horvath said she has been in contact with the captain of the local sheriff station and tried to reach Sheriff Alex Villanueva directly.
"I support a full investigation of all facts related to this case as well as full consideration of all facts by the district attorney," she said. "I am sick and heartbroken by the facts we know so far."
In response to Monday's death, the Los Angeles LGBT Center issued a statement calling for the Sheriff's Department to "fully investigate this tragedy and aggressively seek justice wherever the investigation might lead."
Buck became a nationally known figure in the late 1980s when he led the effort to impeach Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham.
News reports at the time described Buck as a conservative Republican.
The New York Times in 1987 described him as "a 33-year-old millionaire entrepreneur who retired from the insurance service business a year ago to found the Mecham Recall Committee."
Upon learning that Buck is gay, Mecham's aides distributed bumper stickers reading "Queer Ed Buck's Recall." The Arizona governor's efforts to dismiss the recall supporters -- whom he dubbed "a band of homosexuals and a few dissident Democrats" -- with comments about sexual orientation were pilloried in the "Doonesbury" comic strip.
More recently, Buck has donated to various Democratic causes.
Through June, Buck gave $23,600 to California races and causes, including $7,600 to former state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon while he was considering a run for lieutenant governor, according to campaign finance records.
He also donated to candidates running for election to the West Hollywood City Council, Los Angeles Unified School District board and state Senate, and he served on the Stonewall Democratic Club Steering Committee.

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Still in their early 20s, these three young men have been through what anyone would view as a life-changing nightmare -- twice. First came Las Vegas, in October 2017, when they pulled friends and strangers to safety, running along the Strip as bullets hailed from above. Then this November in Thousand Oaks, just miles from their childhood homes, a gunman killed 12 people at their favorite bar, the one they had gone to for comfort when they were recovering from Vegas.
Within a few hours, it became clear that many of the people who were there at the bar that night had just become members of a uniquely American group: survivors of two mass shootings. The day after, I spent hours trying to talk with these people I came to think of as double survivors. Understandably, they were in complete shock, unable to express much more than utterly stunned grief. One of their friends who had made it out with them in Las Vegas had not made it out of Borderline Bar & Grill, nestled into a small office park in Thousand Oaks.
In the days and weeks after the shooting, I thought often about them, eager to understand how they were attempting to make sense of something that seems so hard to fathom. I wanted to know what their friendships were like, how they were supporting each other. When I learned that they had been gathering with each other every night since then, I knew there was a deeper story to understand and tell.
When I reached out to them again, they were more than willing to talk. They had avoided reporters after Las Vegas but were frustrated that the Thousand Oaks shootings had fallen out of the spotlight so quickly, subsumed by the news of wildfires there -- and the ever-quickening news cycle after mass shootings.
Our article focused on 22-year-old Brendan Kelly, who is just days away from shipping off to Afghanistan for his first tour of duty as a Marine. But I also spent time with David Anderson, then 23, and Dylan McNey, 22.
In listening to the stories of these three friends, I was struck by their different reactions to two of the most violent incidents in the last 12 months. They reminded me that we each experience fear and trauma in distinct ways, processing it on our own timeline and terms. All three have tried to move on, to launch into their adult lives, but they have inevitably been thrust in new directions, ones that are not always predictable and not always bad.
Mr. Kelly is almost defiant, embracing another set of risks as a Marine.
As mass shootings have become more common, so have the stories in their aftermath -- and their similarities can lead the public to tune out. Mr. Kelly's defiance made him uniquely compelling, in this uniquely American moment: surviving a massacre here to go fight on a battlefield where the country has been engaged nearly his entire life.
But after the story was published, I began reflecting on the two young men I'd left out of it.
It is often the quieter characters I meet in the course of my reporting who stay with me and keep me thinking late into the night. So much of life is in the gray areas, in how we go on with mundane daily tasks after a life-altering event. That's why I found Mr. Kelly's two friends so compelling.
Mr. Anderson sees fear as something to manage: Next week he will begin a course to become a firefighter, a nearly lifelong dream.
And Mr. McNey, in some ways, avoids fear: After Las Vegas, he dropped out of the community college that had recruited him as a member of the track team and is now working as a carpenter.
When I asked Mr. McNey when he had begun to feel as though his life was back to normal after the 2017 shooting, he answered quickly, as though he had already given it a lot of thought: "About a month before the shooting at Borderline," he said. He calls his work now his first "real adult" job, one that he hopes will turn into a career.
For the last several weeks, the three have spent countless nights together -- at memorials for the friends who were killed, at local bars where they are sometimes greeted as hometown heroes, at each others' homes. Sometimes they speak in explicit terms about the gruesomeness they have seen. But not always. More often, they are simply showing up, embracing each other with a kind of silent grief.
At the same time, they all seemed to welcome long, detailed conversations with me, both to explain and to speculate about how these events have reshaped them. More than once, I smiled as they spoke about the same challenges any 20-something has with dating, their relationship complications compounded as they navigate their grief. I hope to stay in touch with them as they continue to build their adult lives, with all the trials that entails.
None of what they have experienced has altered their worldview -- they are still deeply skeptical of arguments for stricter gun controls; if anything, they say, more "good guys" should be allowed to carry firearms in California.
They have each nurtured close relationships with their family, though they don't always speak to them about exactly how they're feeling.
When I asked Mr. Anderson's mother how he had changed in the last year, she also did not hesitate: "His eyes," she said. He gets a far-off look sometimes, as though he is thinking about something she could never understand. And that, she understands, is true.

Wall Street's 2019 forecast? You might not want to know

Texto completo: In good times and bad, Wall Street has to have a story — a clear, concise view of the economy and markets and how you, our valued client, can make money by trading with us.
As we limp into 2019, about the most upbeat line the pros can spin is that, hey, a recession probably won't hit until next year. Otherwise, most agree that the growth rate for the US economy and corporate earnings will weaken, financial markets will continue to be volatile, and investment profits will be much harder to find.
Just how much harder?
Bloomberg reporters sifted through dozens of Wall Street research notes and provided a Reader's Digest version of the key takeaways.
Morgan Stanley has one of the gloomier outlooks:
“We think the bear market is mostly complete for emerging markets, has further to go in U.S. credit and is about to begin for the dollar. We remain neutral equities, underweight credit, neutral government bonds and overweight cash."
Translation for the average investor: Lay low, and put money in safe certificates of deposit or under your mattress.
State Street Global Advisors tries to find a silver lining:
“Slower global economic growth, higher volatility, less accommodative monetary policies and falling earnings likely mean lower returns. However, the risk of a recession, particularly in the U.S., remains quite low."
Its advice: Some solid companies might get cheap enough to make them a reasonable bargain. Maybe.
So as you open up your year-end retirement plan statement — if you have the stomach to look — it's reasonable to wonder how painful 2019 will be. That's impossible to know right now. There are too many economic and political uncertainties out there to confidently assess whether we'll get a “soft landing" — a gradual slowdown but no recession — or a more damaging contraction.
Here's a subjective and incomplete list of questions (all interrelated) that we need more clarity on:
■ Will consumer confidence hold up? The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell slightly in December, but it remains at a level not seen since just before the 2001 dot-com recession. Because consumer spending accounts for about three-quarters of the US economy, a sharp deterioration in confidence would spell trouble. But some decline should be expected, given the stock market sell-off and the prospects for slower growth.
■ How cold will the housing market get? In Boston, as in many other markets around the country, home prices are rising, but at a slower pace than in the first half of 2018. Inventories remain tight. If you start getting a lot more price-drop alerts from Zillow, be prepared to hunker down. There is a bright spot: Mortgage rates have fallen to an eight-month low.
■ Can the United States and China reach a trade deal? The tariff war has spooked investors and hurt US farmers and companies. A successful resolution would provide a big boost to the market. On Monday, word that Chinese and American negotiators were talking again was enough to help stocks move higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 23,531, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 percent.
■ Will Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of President Trump reveal any impeachable offenses? David Leonhardt of The New York Times wrote a long Sunday opinion piece arguing that Trump is unfit for office. But it seems unlikely that Congress would move against the president if Mueller's probe finds no significant wrongdoing. But if Mueller finds a smoking gun, and the Democrats push to remove the president from office, we could find ourselves in a destablizing constitutional crisis.
■ Will rising wages lead to a reduction in job creation? The blowout December payroll report on Friday (312,000 new private sector jobs) was accompanied by a 3.2 percent gain in average hourly wages over last year. That was the biggest jump in wages since the financial crisis, and good news for workers, who have not fared nearly as well as investors during the long expansion. But if wages start climbing too quickly, the Federal Reserve may get antsy and raise interest rates again, a move that tends to hurt stocks.
■ And, speaking of the Fed and interest rates, can it successfully pursue its primary mission — keeping inflation low and employment high — without inadvertently pushing the economy into a recession? It's a difficult tightrope to walk, but Fed chairman Jerome Powell, after sending conflicting signals, last week made his position clear: While the central bank expects to raise its benchmark federal funds rate twice this year, it will be flexible, acting only if the data warrant tighter credit, not following a predetermined path to bringing rates back to more normal levels.
But there is only so much reassurance the Fed can offer. It has erred in the past — most recently by keeping rates too low for too long, leading to the housing bubble — and Powell is new and hasn't won the trust of investors, as his most immediate predecessors did.
And, most important, it's not the Fed's job to make sure the markets keep going up. Ben Bernanke, who served as Fed chairman from 2006 to 2014, told a conference over the weekend that, in the grand scheme of things, the current correction isn't so catastrophic as to require special intervention.
Looking back at the financial crisis of 2008-2009, he said that “what we've seen in the last year, I hate to tell any investors here, this is not all that huge."
Ugh.

Texto completo: AstraZeneca PLC has appointed José Baselga, a prominent but controversial cancer doctor, to lead oncology research and development as part of a wider overhaul designed to get drugs to market faster.
His appointment Monday comes just months after Dr. Baselga, 59 years old, resigned from a string of top positions--including chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.--for sometimes failing to disclose his ties with the drug industry in academic journal articles.
AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in an interview that the company's chief ethics officer was satisfied that these omissions were accidental, as Dr. Baselga has maintained since his failures were highlighted in a New York Times report in September .
"There is no excuse, and I acknowledge that," Dr. Baselga said in an interview, adding that failure to disclose industry ties was an issue for lots of authors of academic papers because of rule differences between scientific journals.
Authors are required to state potential conflicts of interest, but rules vary between journals on the extent of disclosure required. Dr. Baselga has acted as a paid adviser to several drugmakers at various times.

Astra is hoping that Dr. Baselga's credentials will help it beat out rivals in the rapidly-evolving, and increasingly competitive, market for cancer drugs .
"You can't follow the science if you don't have the best scientists," said Dr. Soriot. "He is one of the best scientists in the world."
The success of its new cancer drugs are in large part responsible for a turnaround at AstraZeneca, which last year returned to growth after years of declining sales because of a string of patent expirations.
Dr. Baselga's role at AstraZeneca is part of an organizational overhaul aimed at simplifying the company's structure. He will be in charge of cancer-drug development from start to finish, replacing a structure where early stage research and late stage clinical trials were managed separately.
AstraZeneca has also created a single research and development unit for its other focus areas: cardiovascular and respiratory medicine, which will be led by Mene Pangalos, previously head of early-stage research and development. Both research and development units will have their own dedicated sales organizations.
The overhaul announced Monday closely follows the departures of two high-profile executives whose roles would have been eliminated by the reorganization: Bahija Jallal, who is taking up the helm at British biotech Immunocore, and Mark Mallon, who is to become chief executive of Cambridge, Mass.-based Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Dr. Soriot said their departures weren't driven by the reorganization, but that they did affect the timing. "It's clear that this reorganization has been considered for some time," he said. "The departures gave us the opportunity to implement it now." The changes will also affect a number of other leadership positions at the company, he said, but that the vast majority of staff won't be affected.

Bill Walton wants Barack Obama as UCLA's next basketball coach

Texto completo: Plenty of names have been floated as potential replacements for Steve Alford at UCLA. The Bruins let Alford go Monday after a dismal start and an embarrassing 15-point home loss to Liberty.
Los Angeles Lakers guard Lonzo Ball suggested former Phoenix Suns coach Earl Watson could take over the program. Former Chicago Bulls and Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg is looking for a job. Nevada coach Eric Musselman might be ready for a jump from the Mountain West to the Pac-12 Conference. Others have wondered if Oklahoma City Thunder coach Billy Donovan would give college basketball another go.
But one UCLA legend has a completely different vision for the Bruins' next coach. Bill Walton wants Barack Obama on the bench.
Walton, the three-time national college player of the year, two-time NCAA champion, 1978 NBA MVP and two-time NBA Finals champion, was on the call for UCLA and Stanford on Tuesday night for ESPN. Play-by-play man Dave Pasch asked what kind of characteristics UCLA should look for in its next coach, and, well, Walton had his mind made up.
"Barack Obama," Walton said, flatly.
"Well, I don't think he's going to coach," Pasch responded.
"Well, you keep saying that, but why? Why are you so negative? Why do you just turn down?" Walton said. "His brother in-law coached. I'm sticking with Barack Obama until he says no."
Walton is right about one thing. Michelle Obama's brother Craig Robinson coached at Oregon State from 2008 to 2014, compiling a 93-104 record and four appearances in the College Basketball Invitational, March's third-tier postseason tournament. The Beavers won the CBI title in 2009.
And the former president does have some moves on the court. He played on his high school's varsity team and made pickup basketball a primary hobby into adulthood.
During his first presidential run, the New York Times described Obama as a "wily player."
Obama also made shooting hoops part of his shtick on the campaign trail. At a campaign stop in Oregon, then-coach Ernie Kent presented him with a Ducks' jersey with "Obama" on the back. During a swing through North Carolina, he scrimmaged with the Tar Heels and posterized star power forward Tyler Hansbrough (with a layup).
At the White House, Obama had the existing tennis court renovated so it could host a full-length basketball court, reveled in visits from pro and college championship teams and made March Madness bracket picks.
And Obama does have (a little) coaching experience. He helped coach his daughter Sasha and her youth team, the Vipers, in 2012.
"There was an end-of-the-season tournament they won - five games in a row," Obama told CBS's Clark Kellogg. "I can't take too much credit for it. What you see is them progressively improving, coming together as a team, running plays, things kicking in that you practice. It's a great, great joy to watch."
But is that enough experience to help UCLA recapture its basketball glory days? Walton, at least, seems anxious to find out.

Crypto Exchange Argues for Rules

Texto completo: Gemini Trust Co., the cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, argues in a new ad campaign that its chaotic sector should protect investors by adopting standard best practices and following regulations. At the same time, not incidentally, the campaign suggests that Gemini already provides shelter from the storm.
Subway, taxi-top and other ads deliver slogans like "The Revolution Needs Rules," "Crypto Without Chaos" and "Money Has a Future." A full-page ad in the New York Times on Monday will press the point, according to Gemini.
"We believe that investors coming into cryptocurrency deserve the exact same protections as investors in more traditional markets, adhering to the same standards, practices, regulations and compliance protocols," said Chris Roan, head of marketing at Gemini.
"In our competitive set there are widely varying degrees of adherence to regulatory guidance from people that oversee the more traditional financial marketers," Mr. Roan added. Some participants are devoted to decentralizing authority over money, a key tenet of many cryptocurrency advocates, while others including Gemini believe there has to be a "bridge" between the old system and a new one, he said.
The ad campaign, which was created by the agency Interesting Development and is Gemini's first notable effort aimed at retail investors, was timed to capitalize on a recently introduced mobile app, Mr. Roan said.
But it arrives on the heels of a brutal year for cryptocurrency values. Allegations of manipulation and fraud in the market are common. The space could arguably use a dose of reputation repair.
Many existing regulations could apply to cryptocurrency but haven't been applied consistently, said Neha Narula, director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. "There is a huge problem with market integrity, with consumer protection, and we definitely need to make sure that regulations are being enforced where they apply."
But regulation of the existing financial system sometimes thwarts innovation, Ms. Narula added. "I wouldn't want it to get to a case with crypto where innovation is stifled because it's too expensive for them to comply with regulation," she said.

Welcoming Tables Laden With Books and Beer

Texto completo: INDIANAPOLIS -- The first thing one notices about Books & Brews is that it's off the beaten path, tucked into an unassuming strip mall in a cluster of industrial-supply stores and a sprawling outpost of The Home Depot near 96th Street on the far north side of Indianapolis. The second thing you may notice upon entering the shop is how inviting it feels, with its bright, bookshelf-lined walls, clusters of sturdy wooden tables and racks of board games -- and that's before you get to the back of the store with a craft-beer taproom, small stage and even more packed bookshelves.
"I started off here mainly because as a start-up, no one will lease to you," said Jason Wuerfel, 38, the founder and president of Books & Brews, during a recent chat at the company's "mother ship" location. But the lack of foot traffic hasn't stopped his establishment from becoming a popular gathering spot.
In addition to its titular fusion of bookshop and brewpub restaurant, Books & Brews is a de facto community center, drawing crowds to trivia contests, fund-raisers, tabletop game gatherings and literary events; Charlaine Harris, the author of "The Southern Vampire Mysteries" series, dropped by for a book signing in 2017. The stage in the back serves as a performance platform for music jams, open-mic nights and readings.
"Our tagline is 'a place for people without a place' and it's a very personal mission to me," Wuerfel said. As an English major and member of the University of Michigan's baseball team during his college years, he said he often felt he was "too jocky" for the nerds and too nerdy for the jocks. "I felt like someone who didn't have a place."
His parents owned and operated hotels, as well as an independent minor-league baseball team, in Traverse City, Mich. In working with them, Wuerfel got a close-up look at entrepreneurship, customer service and the nuts and bolts of running a business. A later stint as a stay-at-home dad gave him the bandwidth to tinker with making his own beer, and he began to develop an idea for just the kind of place he wanted to create.
"The fundamental flaw of the bookstore is that it's designed to be quiet and not let people connect to each other," Wuerfel said. "When you encourage people to walk around, and you have books and board games and music that breathes life into spaces, you naturally provide the framework for social engagement."
A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that began in 2013 raised about $17,000 from more than 150 backers. To help keep costs down, Wuerfel taught himself carpentry and built most of the store's wooden furniture himself.
Books & Brews opened in March 2014, and Wuerfel's vision of a place for people to "read, drink, converse" brought in the customers. He expanded his original footprint before the end of the first year to 4,500 square feet from 2,250 square feet by leasing the empty warehouse next door. "There were nights when I'd just run to Home Depot and buy folding chairs so people would have someplace to sit," he recalled.
The books for sale all around the store are mostly used, taken by donation and sold for $3 each. A corner nook of children's books and a retro video-game setup await younger visitors. Ten percent of used-book sales are given to Indy Reads, an area organization that promotes literacy.
The store also offers a rack of new books for sale at the cover price, including titles by Indianapolis native Kurt Vonnegut Jr., whose maternal grandfather was Albert Lieber, a well-known local brewer in his day, and featured in Vonnegut's autobiographical "Palm Sunday."
[Read the 1981 Times review of Kurt Vonnegut's "Palm Sunday: An Autobiographical Collage."]
As for the brews, the company has its own line of craft beers, sporting playful names like Shogun Soba Ale and Charlie and the Chocolate Stout. Customers have even dubbed some of the beers -- a librarian came up with "Nancy Brew and the Hoppy Boys," the company's popular pale ale.
The Books & Brews mother ship is not alone anymore. Wuerfel expanded and franchised the business over the past few years to eight other locations (so far) around central Indiana and now partners with Flat12 Bierwerks to produce his beer.
He credits much of his business model's success to warm customer care and creating situations for guests to feel like they belong. "One hundred percent of the people who are here on any given night are here because they purposefully came for Books & Brews," he said. "That is true destination appeal and really makes the atmosphere fantastic."

Texto completo: Did you receive an Instant Pot as a Christmas gift? Are you wondering what to make other than the recipes that came with it?
Because of the Instant Pot's popularity, cookbooks abound. There are Instant Pot cookbooks for specific cuisines (Indian, Mexican, Southern) and cookbooks geared toward vegetarians and for healthy cooking. Diet-wise, there are keto- and paleo-inspired Instant Pot cookbooks.
There are also cookbooks featuring holiday dishes, six-ingredient-or-less recipes, fast-and-easy dishes, and, of course, cookbooks authorized by the makers of Instant Pot. Most all of the books have Instant Pot instructions and cover all their functions.
The Instant Pot began showing up in 2010 and has gained popularity over the last several years. It has taken the fear out pressure cooking, making it convenient, fast and safe. For many cooks, it's a cooking game changer because it allows them to prepare a fork-tender roast or a rack of ribs in an hour. Add in all its other functions (sauteing, slow cooking, steaming, yogurt making and more), and the Instant Pot can be quite appealing.
In the last several months more than dozen Instant Pot and multi-cooker cookbooks have landed on my desk.
Here's a peek into three:
'Comfort in an Instant: 75 Comfort Food Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot,' by Melissa Clark. (Clarkson Potter, $22). What: This is the second Instant Pot cookbook for Clark, a New York Times food columnist. Her first was "Dinner in an Instant: 75 Modern Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot" (Clarkson Potter, $22.) Clark provides the classic recipes in the breakfast, soup, side dish, main dish and dessert categories. Nearly all are ready in an hour. If applicable, most recipes have a conversion to cook in a slow-cooker.
Best aspect: Most recipes are held to one page and approachable. Clark admits up-front that determining cooking time isn't an exact science and notes that you have to allow time for the pot to come up to pressure. She advises using suggested cooking times as just a guideline.
'The Ultimate Instant Pot Cookbook: 200 Deliciously Simple Recipes for Your Electric Pressure Cooker,' By Coco Morante (Ten Speed Press, $29.99). What: Coco Morante"s first cookbook was "The Essential Instant Pot Cookbook." She also runs the Instant Pot Recipes Facebook page and has her own blog, leftyspoon.com. There are more than nine chapters covering everything from vegetarian fare to seafood to pantry staples such as broths, sauces, jams and jellies. The recipes range from weekday recipes for busy cooks to soups and main dishes to classics like stew and mashed potatoes.
Best aspect: The explanation of what you need and how to use the Instant Pot is very comprehensive. From Beef Pho to Tortellini and Spinach Soup to Lamb Shanks with Tomato Sauce, the recipes are easy to follow and inviting.
'Instant Pot Fast & Easy: 100 Simple and Delicious Recipes for Your Instant Pot,' by Urvashi Pitre (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $21.99). What: In this book, her third involving the multi-cooker, Urvashi Pitre provides well-tested recipes from around the world. Pitre is the founder of the blog twosleevers.com and runs a global consulting firm. Recipes are organized by chapters based on the main ingredients: chicken, seafood, beef, pork, lamb, lentils and beans and rice, etc. Pitre's knowledge of Instant Pot terms and her answers to frequently asked questions chapters are invaluable.
Best aspect: The global flavors instilled in the recipes are splendid, and so are the instructions. Each recipe is topped with the active time, the function to use, how it's released and the total time which is useful to the cook.
Ginger Sesame Glazed Spare Ribs
Serves: 4 / Prep time: 25 minutes / Pressure cook time: 34 minutes / Total time: 1 hour 10 minutes
5 large garlic cloves
2 tablespoons chopped candied ginger
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon sake, white wine or dry vermouth
2 tablespoons white sesame seeds, plus more for garnish
2 teaspoons gochugaru (Korean chile flakes) or crushed red pepper flakes
11/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup soy sauce
5 pounds pork spare ribs, racks cut into 2 or 3 pieces
Lime wedges, for serving
In a mini food processor or blender, puree the garlic, candied ginger, fresh ginger, brown sugar, sesame oil, sake, sesame seeds, gochugaru and black pepper. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl and whisk in the soy sauce.
Toss the ribs with the sauce, then transfer the ribs to the pressure cooker pot, arranging them standing up along the wall of the pot with the meat facing the wall. Continue with the remaining ribs, placing them in concentric circles. Pour any remaining sauce over the ribs.
Lock the lid into place and cook on high pressure for 34 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange the ribs, meat side down, on the sheet. Using the saute function, reduce the sauce in the pressure cooker to a thick glaze, 8 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the broiler.
Brush the thickened glaze on the ribs and broil the ribs until they are charred in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip the ribs and brush again with the glaze, then broil until evenly charred, 2 to 4 minutes more. Brush with more glaze and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve hot with lime wedges on the side.

Texto completo: The Fox Cities Performing Arts Center isn't wasting any time getting the new year started, with the touring production of the Broadway musical "Anastasia" opening Tuesday for a six-day, eight-show run. Before the third show of the PAC's Broadway season begins its journey to the past, here's a roundup of what you should know — about the musical, its history and whether or not it's worth opening your wallet for.
So, 'Anastasia.' What is it? "Anastasia" is a musical inspired by the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, who was murdered with her family by Bolshevik secret police in 1918. In this story Anastasia survives, suffers from memory loss and years later learns of her true identity. Perhaps you remember the animated film from 20-some years ago?
It's not a direct adaptation of the 1997 Fox Animation Studios movie of the same name, but is inspired by it. Same goes for the 1956 "Anastasia" film that won actress Ingrid Bergman an Academy Award. (You may run into a tagline or two about the musical being "inspired by the 20th Century Fox motion pictures." That's why.)
A few of the songs from the 1997 film, including "Once Upon a December" and "Journey to the Past," are in the musical, but the majority of the songs are new.
Among the elements not making the trip to the stage are Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok, the villains of the animated version of the story. Instead the antagonist here is Gleb, a Bolshevik general.
Lila Coogan, the actress who plays the lead role of Anya (Anastasia) on the tour, said the musical is sort of like a grown-up version of the story from the film.
"We don't have a talking bat. We don't have a fantastical demon from the other world," she said. "We have real people struggling with real issues in a real time setting."
Who's behind it? Terrence McNally, a playwright with a lengthy list of accolades to his credit (including multiple Tony and Drama Desk awards), wrote the book. Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, two more Tony winners, handled the music. Those three also worked together on the decorated mid-'90s musical "Ragtime."
Darko Tresnjak directs. He's best known as the Tony Award-winning director of "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder."
Is it new? Yes. It made its debut on Broadway in March 2017 and the tour on its way to Appleton began in October. This visit to the Fox Cities PAC is its Wisconsin premiere.
How's it been received? Reviews have been mostly called it ... fine. The Hollywood Reporter labeled it a "pretty but anodyne musical, which ends up being more satisfying than the sum of its parts."
In the New York Times it was compared to "those mid-20th-century musicals that must've sounded like a good idea at the time, but tend to be remembered today only by hard-core aficionados of the genre." Young adults who remember the animated film may latch on, the Times' Ben Brantley wrote, but those without "such nostalgic insulation are likely to find this 'Anastasia' a chore."
The Broadway production picked up two Tony Award nominations in 2017: one for actress Mary Beth Peil and one for costume design. Neither won.
At the Drama Desk Awards, there was more love in the form of nine nominations, though the result was just a single win in the projection design category.
What else is there to know? Coogan said the first thing she often hears praise for is what the musical looks like.
"I think visually, across the board, the show is absolutely stunning," she said. "We have the best costumes that anyone could ask for, designed by Linda Cho; a gorgeous, gorgeous set; these projection screens that take you from Paris to Russia and all over the place, they're just so beautiful. It's magical to see."
If you thought the animated "Anastasia" movie, done by Fox Animation Studios, was made by Disney, it's a common mistake. That's because it looks like a Disney film and its directors, Gary Goldman and Don Bluth, had both worked for Disney. (Bluth also directed "An American Tail," "The Land Before Time" and "All Dogs Go to Heaven." Goldman was a producer on each.)
That movie, which featured voice work by Meg Ryan, Christopher Lloyd, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Hank Azaria, made more than $58 million and was the second highest-grossing animated movie of 1997. ("Hercules" was first.)
Coogan said she loved the 1997 movie and the Anastasia character specifically.
"She was the first princess I can recall that kind of had a bit to her," she said. "I personally am not like a flowers and sunshine kind of girl. I'm a little bit spunkier and kookier than that. It was just way more relatable at that time in my life for me."
The "Anastasia" opening is one of three Wisconsin premieres in the 2018-19 Kimberly-Clark Broadway Across America-Fox Cities Series. By season's end, the Fox Cities PAC will have hosted 36 statewide premieres since opening in 2002. Next up this season? "The Lion King," which made its Wisconsin premiere at the PAC in 2007.

Inquiry Into Shelter Provider Poses Dilemma: What About the Children?

Texto completo: A difficult situation for migrant children in government custody could grow more challenging if the largest provider in the overburdened shelter system were to lose its grants.
The provider, Southwest Key Programs, faces mounting pressure after a video of staff members abusing children surfaced last month and the Justice Department opened an investigation into its finances. State and federal officials have cracked down on suspected malfeasance at shelters in the past year, closing multiple facilities, including two run by Southwest Key, and moving children elsewhere.
But taking any broader action on Southwest Key, a nonprofit that houses almost a third of detained migrant youth, would be a balancing act for officials as they tried to avoid tipping an overstressed system into chaos. Without adequate shelter space, minors remain stuck at border stations ill-equipped to care for them. After the recent deaths of two children in Border Patrol custody, the stakes have never been clearer.
About 12,400 migrant children are now housed across roughly 100 permanent sites and two temporary ones. That's down from the record level of almost 15,000 last month, largely because the Trump administration relaxed its rule requiring fingerprints for every member of a household sponsoring a child.
By any measure, Southwest Key is the industry juggernaut. The Austin-based charity operates 24 permanent facilities in Texas, Arizona and California. One of those is the nation's largest permanent shelter, a converted Walmart Supercenter in Brownsville, Tex., that can house more than 1,400 minors.
Southwest Key, which has pulled in $1.7 billion over the past decade, is being investigated by the Justice Department after a New York Times article documented possible financial improprieties and poor management. The charity stockpiled tens of millions in taxpayer dollars with little government oversight, possibly engaged in self-dealing with top executives and paid them significantly higher than the federal salary cap for migrant shelter grants.
But if the federal government revoked its grants, there would not be enough room in the crowded system to absorb the children under its care. Officials would need to find another provider to take over Southwest Key's shelters, or find new facilities altogether.
Maria Cancian, a former deputy assistant secretary for policy in the Administration for Children and Families, said if a large provider had lost its contracts under her watch, she would try to maintain as many of the provider's staff and facilities as possible.
"The logical thing to do to maximize safety and minimize waste of public funds would not be to immediately shut down an enormous number of shelters," Ms. Cancian said. "The best course of action would be to figure out a plan for transitioning those facilities and transitioning those personnel."
The Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that oversees migrant shelters as part of the Administration for Children and Families, declined to speculate on Southwest Key's grants. In response to a question asking if the agency had a plan if the charity were to lose its grants, a spokeswoman said the agency was always planning for unforeseen events.
A Southwest Key spokesman, Jeff Eller, said the charity had had no discussions about losing its grants with the Office of Refugee Resettlement or about its shelter licenses with officials from Texas, Arizona or California. He said the charity was focused on providing "the best care possible" for children.
Last year, the government cut off the contracts of another major shelter provider, International Educational Services, over suspected financial improprieties. Juan Sanchez, who founded Southwest Key and still runs it, also helped establish I.E.S., although he has not had a role there for decades.
The closing of I.E.S. facilities was carried out haphazardly, straining the system for months. As many as 620 children needed to be rehoused; most landed in Southwest Key facilities.
Comprehensive Health Services, a for-profit company based in Florida that ran one of the temporary shelters, leased three former I.E.S. shelters, all in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, and then received a new government contract. Many original staff members were rehired.
Two Southwest Key facilities closed last year -- including the shelter where staff members were caught on video abusing children -- as part of a settlement with Arizona after the charity failed to provide proof that its workers had received required background checks. Those shelters could house more than 500 children. Southwest Key's six remaining shelters in Arizona also can no longer accept new children until the state says otherwise.
If the government ends up seeking a provider to take over Southwest Key's remaining shelters, Comprehensive Health Services, a workplace medical contractor that has provided support during emergencies, is a likely alternative. But the company has also been accused of improperly handling government money.
In February 2017, Comprehensive Health Services paid a settlement of almost $4 million over improperly charging the government for medical screenings. The company said the overbilling was a mistake.
The country's second-largest provider, a San Antonio-based nonprofit called BCFS, seems unlikely to take over all Southwest Key's shelters. Its primary focus has long been disaster relief and international aid, and the nonprofit has faced daily protests for running a sprawling tent city in Tornillo, Tex.
The government may also try to delay deciding on Southwest Key contracts until it reduces the number of children in federal custody -- or, at the least, reduces the number of children placed with Southwest Key.
A major reason for the shelters' overcrowding was the administration's decision in June to require fingerprints for every member of a household that wanted to care for migrant children. As fingerprinting slowed placement, the average length of time children spent in shelters stretched from about a month to nearly two.
In December, the Trump administration relaxed the fingerprinting requirements. The tent city, scheduled to close by Jan. 15, has already been reduced from 2,850 children to 1,500. In November, Southwest Key housed as many as 5,000, but as of Friday, there were only 3,900.
Still, the temporary shelter run by Comprehensive Health Services is expanding, from a capacity of 1,350 to 2,350 children.

Some TSA screeners calling in sick, but Honolulu appears unaffected

Información de publicación: Honolulu Star - Advertiser ; Honolulu, Hawaii [Honolulu, Hawaii]. 05 Jan 2019.

Texto completo: Transportation Security Administration workers at several major airports around the country, working without pay since the partial government shutdown began Dec. 22, have been calling in sick in heightened numbers, according to union and airport management officials.
More than 150 TSA employees, many of them responsible for screening passengers, called in Friday morning at Kennedy International Airport in New York to say they were ill or otherwise unable to work their shifts, according to a union official with knowledge of the situation.
The staffing gap was covered by other officers, who are also working without pay, the person said.
At Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, many travelers — both locals and visitors — were unaware of the TSA sickouts or call-outs at some mainland airports.
State Department of Transportation spokesman Tim Sakahara said in an email, “HDOT has not experienced significant impacts to travelers as a result of the federal government shutdown as essential safety personnel have continued to report for work.”
A Honolulu TSA agent, who declined to be named, said he was aware of a sickout involving 150 employees at a mainland airport. “Here, I don’t know of anyone calling in sick.”
The so-called call-outs have spiked to three times their normal level at Dallas- Fort Worth International Airport, where an average of 25 TSA employees usually call in sick per shift, a local official of the agency told CNN, which first reported on the story.
The shutdown has left 800,000 federal workers either on furlough or working without pay because their jobs are deemed essential.
Dissatisfaction and anger have been growing over the past few days as workers face their first period without a paycheck this weekend. Increased sick calls at TSA could increase the pressure on the White House and Congress to resolve the shutdown more quickly.
A federal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to comment publicly on the matter, said the call-outs seemed to be a coordinated protest. But union officials said many of the workers who called in sick were most likely seeking alternative temporary employment to make up for lost wages.
TSA spokesman Michael Bilello told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser on Friday, “There is no sickout anywhere. This is not a real story.”
However, he said in an email, “TSA is closely monitoring the situation. Call outs began over the Holiday period and have increased, but are causing minimal impact given there are 51,739 employees supporting the screening process.”
“Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change,” he wrote. “Wait times may be affected depending on the number of call outs.
“To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards. Yesterday, TSA screened over 2.2 million passengers. Overall, 99.8% waited less than 30 minutes.”
At Honolulu’s airport the TSA checkpoint lines were short mid- to late Friday afternoon, possibly due to few departing flights.
Two checkpoints in Terminal 2 were closed, and travelers had to walk to an open checkpoint at the far end of the terminal.
Greg Brown, 61, of Birmingham, Ala., said his plane was delayed an hour on the tarmac in Atlanta before taking off for Hawaii, but not because of TSA.
“Because of the government shutdown, there were no air traffic controllers,” he said. “They got the problem solved, but we sat in the plane for about an hour.”
Hanna Rifaey, 38, of Washington, D.C., said, “We feel very bad for TSA having to work on the holidays” and not being paid.
She and her family flew out Dec. 21, before the government shutdown.
Her husband, a lawyer for the Department of Commerce in Washington, is not an essential employee, so he may not be going back to work for a while.
Rifaey said they didn’t look forward to returning home and wanted to stay in Hawaii. “D.C. is always very depressing during a shutdown,” she said.
“TSA is grateful to the agents who show up to work, remain focused on the mission and respectful to the traveling public as they continue the important work necessary to secure the nation’s transportation systems,” Bilello said in an email.
Sakahara urged travelers to give themselves plenty of time to pass through the security checkpoints.
He also encouraged travelers to “pack extra patience and show aloha,” as essential federal employees do not know when their next paycheck will arrive.
Bilello said exempt TSA employees have not missed a paycheck. Their next paycheck, which they might receive if funds are appropriated by midweek, is due Friday.

Texto completo: Illustration Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court Nathan Coats, center, administered the oath of office on Friday to new Colorado senators at the Colorado State Capitol.

Do you know any government employees?
Think for a moment, are there any people you've known or know now who presently work for one of America's governments — federal, state, county, or municipal? Family members? Friends? Colleagues? Acquaintances? If so, those people have each taken an oath of office by which they've solemnly pledged to uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution and follow the laws of the land. And if they're members of the armed services, the Uniform Code of Military Justice also requires them to follow international laws and conventions.
When a government, or a part of that government, breaks the law or violates the Constitution, when they behave corruptly or disrespect citizens' or others' rights, they are able to do so only because one or more oath-taking employees have, consciously or unconsciously, engaged in activity that contravenes their oath of office. And in most cases, the on-the-ground negative consequences of corrupt, otherwise malicious, or simply mistaken intent on the part of elected or appointed higher-ups only occur because employees below them in the chain of command have followed their wrongful orders or directives.
America's armed forces, scandalized and chastened by the horrific 1968 massacre of multiple hundreds of innocent Vietnamese civilians at My Lai by U.S. soldiers, developed strict regulations requiring that all personnel refuse to follow any "illegitimate" orders. They now seriously and repeatedly train their troops on these regulations. And when, in 2015 and 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed that the American military and intelligence agencies should return to the use of torture, openly imagined a policy of killing known family members of terrorists, and suggested the U.S. should have "taken" Iraq's oil before pulling out of the country, heads of the armed forces and those intelligence agencies immediately and very publicly stated that they would not follow such illegal orders from a commander in chief.
When acclaimed journalist Seymour Hersh, who broke the stories of both My Lai and U.S. torture of detainees in the Abu Graib prison in Iraq, was asked last year about the success of his investigative reporting, he replied, "It's all about finding people that take an oath of office (to speak out)."
The amount of corruption inside Trump's administration is likely greater than in any U.S. presidential administration since Warren G. Harding's of Teapot Dome infamy. When New York Times writers David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick compiled the paper's "Definitive List" of that corruption last October, they noted, "President Trump, his family and more than a few of his appointees are using his presidency to enrich themselves. They are spending taxpayer dollars for their own benefit. They are accepting sweetheart deals from foreigners. And they are harnessing the power of the federal government on behalf of their businesses," adding, "They are betting that they can get away with it. So far, Congress has let them."
With Democrats set to taking control of the House of Representatives, Congressional Republicans have been circulating in Republican circles a spreadsheet listing over 100 formal requests for investigation of the Trump administration already made by House Democrats from almost every committee, requests that Republicans will no longer be able to stymie. This state of affairs, pre-midterms, terrified Republicans, Jonathan Swann of Axios reported, further noting, "Lawyers close to the White House tell me the Trump administration is nowhere near prepared for the investigatory onslaught that awaits them, and they consider it among the greatest threats to his presidency."
When Trump feels under attack and in deep, existential danger is when he and his henchfolk are most likely to take dramatic, destructive action and call on perceived allies and others in the government to come to his aid by performing actions that make mockery of the rule of law. That is why now is the time for you to contact every person you know who works in any government in the United States and urge that they understand their oath of office gives them the right and responsibility to refuse any order or directive that they perceive to violate that oath. The personal, human connection you establish with such communication could well make the difference between them aiding and abetting criminal conspiracy and them holding strong their personal portion of the national bulwark against official corruption, rights abuse, and anti-democracy. Thank you for acting.

Texto completo: Over the past 30 years, a shrewd and expensive lobbying campaign has made Americans more tolerant of marijuana. In November 2018, Michigan became the 10th state to legalize recreational cannabis use; New Jersey and others may soon follow. Already, more than 200 million Americans live in states that have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. Yet even as marijuana use has become more socially acceptable, psychiatrists and epidemiologists have reached a consensus that it presents more serious risks than most people realize.
Contrary to the predictions of both advocates and opponents, legalization hasn't led to a huge increase in people using the drug casually. About 15% of Americans used cannabis at least once in 2017, up from 10% in 2006, according to the federal government's National Survey on Drug Use and Health. By contrast, almost 70% of Americans had an alcoholic drink in the past year.
But the number of Americans who use cannabis heavily is soaring. In 2006, about 3 million Americans reported using the drug at least 300 times a year, the standard for daily use. By 2017, that number had increased to 8 million -- approaching the 12 million Americans who drank every day. Put another way, only one in 15 drinkers consumed alcohol daily; about one in five marijuana users used cannabis that often.
And they are consuming cannabis that is far more potent than ever before, as measured by the amount of THC it contains. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical responsible for the drug's psychoactive effects. In the 1970s, most marijuana contained less than 2% THC. Today, marijuana routinely contains 20-25% THC, thanks to sophisticated farming and cloning techniques and to the demand of users to get a stronger high more quickly. In states where cannabis is legal, many users prefer extracts that are nearly pure THC.
Cannabis advocates often argue that the drug can't be as neurotoxic as studies suggest because otherwise Western countries would have seen population-wide increases in psychosis alongside rising marijuana use. In reality, accurately tracking psychosis cases is impossible in the U.S. The government carefully tracks diseases such as cancer with central registries, but no such system exists for schizophrenia or other severe mental illnesses.
Some population-level data does exist, though. Research from Finland and Denmark, two countries that track mental illness more accurately, shows a significant increase in psychosis since 2000, following an increase in cannabis use. And last September, a large survey found a rise in serious mental illness in the U.S. too. In 2017, 7.5% of young adults met the criteria for serious mental illness, double the rate in 2008.
None of these studies prove that rising cannabis use has caused population-wide increases in psychosis or other mental illness, although they do offer suggestive evidence of a link. What is clear is that, in individual cases, marijuana can cause psychosis, and psychosis is a high risk factor for violence. What's more, much of that violence occurs when psychotic people are using drugs. As long as people with schizophrenia are avoiding recreational drugs, they are only moderately more likely to become violent than healthy people. But when they use drugs, their risk of violence skyrockets. The drug they are most likely to use is cannabis.
The most obvious way that cannabis fuels violence in psychotic people is through its tendency to cause paranoia. Even marijuana advocates acknowledge that the drug can cause paranoia; the risk is so obvious that users joke about it, and dispensaries advertise certain strains as less likely to do so. But for people with psychotic disorders, paranoia can fuel extreme violence. A 2007 paper in the Medical Journal of Australia looked at 88 defendants who had committed homicide during psychotic episodes. It found that most of the killers believed they were in danger from the victim, and almost two-thirds reported misusing cannabis -- more than alcohol and amphetamines combined.
The link between marijuana and violence doesn't appear limited to people with pre-existing psychosis. Researchers have studied alcohol and violence for generations, proving that alcohol is a risk factor for domestic abuse, assault and even murder. Far less work has been done on marijuana, in part because advocates have stigmatized anyone who raises the issue. Still, there are studies showing that marijuana use is a significant risk factor for violence.
A 2012 paper in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, examining a federal survey of more than 9,000 adolescents, found that marijuana use was associated with a doubling of domestic violence in the U.S. A 2017 paper in the journal Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, examining drivers of violence among 6,000 British and Chinese men, found that drug use was linked to a fivefold increase in violence, and the drug used was nearly always cannabis.
Before states legalized recreational cannabis, advocates predicted that legalization would let police focus on hardened criminals rather than on marijuana smokers and thus reduce violent crime. Some advocates even claim that legalization has reduced violent crime: In a 2017 speech calling for federal legalization, Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said that "these states are seeing decreases in violent crime."
But Mr. Booker is wrong. The first four states to legalize marijuana for recreational use were Colorado and Washington in 2014 and Alaska and Oregon in 2015. Combined, those four states had about 450 murders and 30,300 aggravated assaults in 2013. In 2017, they had almost 620 murders and 38,000 aggravated assaults -- an increase far greater than the national average.
Knowing exactly how much of that increase is related to cannabis is impossible without researching every crime. But for centuries, people all over the world have understood that cannabis causes mental illness and violence -- just as they've known that opiates cause addiction and overdose. Hard data on the relationship between marijuana and madness dates back 150 years, to British asylum registers in India.
Yet 20 years ago, the U.S. moved to encourage wider use of cannabis and opiates. In both cases, we decided we could outsmart these drugs -- enjoying their benefits without their costs. And in both cases, we were wrong. Opiates are riskier than cannabis, and the overdose deaths they cause are a more imminent crisis, so public and government attention have focused on them. Soon, the mental illness and violence that follow cannabis use also may be too widespread to ignore.

AJC DIGGING DEEPER VOTING ISSUES: Democrats' push for election changes faces uphill battle: GOP wary of effort to change finance laws, take power from states.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- House Democrats unveiled sweeping legislation Friday that would change the way states administer federal elections, an attempt to prevent officials from conducting the kind of mass voter registration cancellations that became an issue before last year's midterms in Georgia.
The measure, given the symbolically important bill number House Resolution 1, seeks to make it easier for people to vote and limit the reach of special interests in elections. It is likely to face a quick death in the Senate, where Republican leaders are wary of changing campaign finance laws and taking the power to administer elections away from states.
But a narrow avenue for cooperation did appear to open Friday when a key House Republican separately raised the prospect of hearings in Georgia and three other states about reported voting irregularities during last year's elections.
Democrats indicated they were setting their sights far more broadly.
During a crowded press conference steps from the House floor, dozens of Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Atlanta U.S. Rep. John Lewis unveiled their legislative package, which would also require presidents to release their tax returns, bar lawmakers from serving on corporate boards and outlaw partisan gerrymandering by state legislatures.
"Restoring the peoples' faith in government is really our agenda," said Pelosi, a Democrat from California.
Proposed changes
The legislation would require automatic voter registration for federal elections, expand early voting and set aside money for states to bolster their election infrastructure, including transitioning to paper ballots -- a major priority of the Georgia Legislature this year.
It also seeks to set conditions for states seeking to remove voters from the rolls. It would clarify that a "failure to vote is not grounds for removing registered voters from the rolls," an indirect reference to Georgia's practice of canceling registrations of voters who don't participate in elections for several years. About 1.4 million people have been removed from Georgia's voting rolls since 2012.
"I truly believe deep in my heart, in my soul, the way votes were not counted and purged in Georgia and Florida and other states changed the outcome of the last election," said Lewis, a 17-term House member who was a leader of the civil rights movement. "That must never happen again in our country."
Missing from the 571-page package is language shoring up the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which has been a major priority for Democrats following a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision that gutted portions of the law requiring Georgia and other states to clear any proposed changes to voting laws with the Justice Department.
Without federal oversight, county election officials have closed 214 precincts across Georgia since 2012, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in August.
U.S. Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., one of the chief architects of the measure, said the party first wanted to build a "robust record" of hearings and testimony so that future voting rights bills would have a better chance of withstanding any court challenges.
"It'll be given special handling, have its own set of hearings, build the record carefully so it passes that standard that the Supreme Court has articulated," Sarbanes told reporters. "That was a pretty easy choice to make."
Pelosi promised the Voting Rights Act updates would come "in short order" in separate legislation.
The measure had at least one notable admirer in Georgia.
Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams called it a "critical first step in addressing the flaws in our nation's voting laws and election integrity."
After narrowly losing the election to the state's top office to Republican Brian Kemp last year, Abrams founded the voting rights group Fair Fight Action, which filed a lawsuit alleging systematic mismanagement across Georgia's elections system.
Partisan fight likely
The legislation was rolled out without any GOP support, a sign that it likely won't advance far out of the House. Many Republicans have criticized the public cost of having taxpayers foot the bill for political campaigns, which the initiative would incentivize by matching some small donations.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,who has advocated for loosening campaign finance restrictions, previously cast doubt on the bill's constitutionality.
The measure, he said at an event in December, was "probably going to be a blatantly unconstitutional effort to have the government basically micromanage the way we handle elections," according to The New York Times.
There are potentially some narrower areas for cooperation. One emerged Friday when U.S. Rep.Rodney Davis of Illinois, the top Republican on a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over federal elections, wrote a letter to the panel's chairwoman noting examples of voting irregularities in the "processes and procedures" of local county election officials in several states related to provisional ballots, signature verification requirements and mail-in ballots.
Without giving any details, Davis appeared to hint that the committee found something amiss in Georgia, California, Illinois and Utah after sending election monitors there.He requested the panel hold field hearings in those states.
"These reported irregularities raise questions about the appropriate safeguards states have in place with respect to these non-traditional voting methods," Davis wrote to Ohio Democrat Marcia Fudge. "The Committee's oversight responsibilities over federal elections dictate that we pursue these irregularities, potentially fraudulent activities, reported by House-sanctioned observers."
Georgia's election for governor in November was plagued by hours-long lines at some precincts, malfunctioning voting machines and voters who said their registrations hadn't been processed.
County election officials reported rejecting nearly 7,000 absentee ballots, often because election officials decided voters' signatures didn't match those on file, and for relatively minor transgressions such as filling out the outside of the ballot envelopes incorrectly.

Texto completo: Newly inaugurated Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley announced on Twitter Friday night that she would be cosponsoring legislation to get rid of a fiscal measure known as "pay as you go," or PAYGO.
According to the New York Times, PAYGO requires all new spending to be offset by equal cuts or tax increases. The rule, echoing a provision in federal law and in the Senate's rules, would require the House to offset any spending so as not to increase the budget deficit.
Pressley said on Twitter she was “proud" to “cosponsor legislation to finally address a real problem that has stalled the progressive agenda."
“I was sent to Congress to be bold, unbought and unbossed," Pressley said in the tweet. “More robust than a rule, this bill will get to the heart of disparities promulgated by the #PAYGO statute."
The Massachusetts Democrat retweeted an announcement from Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat and co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who said she wanted to “get rid of this nonsensical rule that is bad for our economy and for working people."
Congressoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, has been outspoken against PAYGO. In a tweet, Ocasio-Cortez referred to it as not only “bad economics," but also “a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on heathcare."

Texto completo: Gemini Trust Co., the cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, argues in a new ad campaign that its chaotic sector should protect investors by adopting standard best practices and following regulations. At the same time, not incidentally, the campaign suggests that Gemini already provides shelter from the storm.
Subway, taxi-top and other ads deliver slogans like "The Revolution Needs Rules," "Crypto Without Chaos" and "Money Has a Future." A full-page ad in the New York Times on Monday will press the point, according to Gemini.
"We believe that investors coming into cryptocurrency deserve the exact same protections as investors in more traditional markets, adhering to the same standards, practices, regulations and compliance protocols," said Chris Roan, head of marketing at Gemini.
"In our competitive set there are widely varying degrees of adherence to regulatory guidance from people that oversee the more traditional financial marketers," Mr. Roan added. Some players are devoted to decentralizing authority over money, a key tenet of many cryptocurrency advocates, while others including Gemini believe there has to be a "bridge" between the old system and a new one, he said.
The ad campaign, which was created by the agency Interesting Development and is Gemini's first notable effort aimed at retail investors, was timed to capitalize on a recently introduced mobile app, Mr. Roan said. But it arrives on the heels of a brutal year for cryptocurrency values. Allegations of manipulation and fraud in the market are common . The space could arguably use a dose of reputation repair.
Many existing regulations could apply to cryptocurrency but haven't been applied consistently, said Neha Narula, director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. "There is a huge problem with market integrity, with consumer protection, and we definitely need to make sure that regulations are being enforced where they apply."
But regulation of the existing financial system sometimes thwarts innovation, Ms. Narula added. "I wouldn't want it to get to a case with crypto where innovation is stifled because it's too expensive for them to comply with regulation," she said.

The Great Unloved American Economy; Financial markets signal trouble ahead, but the latest NFIB employer survey says it's still a job seeker's market.

Texto completo: Stocks have beenselling off today thanks to a revenue warning from Apple and a report of slower growth in U.S. manufacturing. But the latest jobs survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, due out later today, shows a historically vibrant labor market among small firms. "Job creation was solid in December with a net addition of 0.25 workers per firm," says NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg. This figure is up from 0.19 in November and represents the best reading since July.
It's the same story that this column reported a month ago : stocks of public companies are slumping but the job market is still bumping at American small businesses. This means raises for American workers. Writes Mr. Dunkelberg:
The percent of business owners reporting that they increased employee compensation continued at 45 year record high levels. A net 35 percent reported higher compensation in December and a net 24 percent planned increases in the next few months (down 1 point), predicting further gains in wages and benefits.
The continuing strength in the NFIB data is not a reason to ignore various signs of slowing U.S. growth. But it is a reminder that the economy remains healthy and while trade disputes cloud the horizon, companies across many U.S. industries are still hiring. In fact they are even more eager to add staff than they were a month ago. "A seasonally-adjusted net 23 percent plan to create new jobs, up 1 point from November's reading," says Mr. Dunkelberg.
The continuing question during this economic expansion is whether employers will be able to find all the people they want to hire. "Thirty-nine percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period, up 5 points and a new record high. Labor markets are still exceptionally tight," adds the NFIB economist. "Labor force growth has now become a serious constraint on growth in the economy. With a million more job openings that people wanting a job, it is a great environment for workers, with wages rising and lots of job alternatives to choose from."
The historic American worker shortage continues.

In Illinois, signs of intelligent life in the Democratic Party

Texto completo: If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats’ House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic: In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue — 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district’s residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district’s 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump’s approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964 — who have been America’s largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are — were; they are shuffling off stage — almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year’s midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" — people with no religion — "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats’ capture of New York’s 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November — the Democrats lost only two seats nationally — come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England. If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party — come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined — they should want to emulate Bustos’ success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family’s budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent’s disposable income. Bustos’ question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

Ferndale's busy Ringwald Theatre isn't taking time off for some post-New Year's recuperating on this first weekend of 2019. Debuting Friday is its production of "SIGNIFICANT OTHER," a dark comedy by Joshua Harmon ("Bad Jews") about four friends in their late 20s and their quest for meaningful relationships. Its central character is a gay man with no Mr. Right in sight who's forced to watch sadly as his three female besties get married one by one. The play, which earned a rave review from the New York Times during off-Broadway run in 2015, arrived on Broadway in 2017 for a limited engagement. The Ringwald staging is being directed by Brandy Joe Plambeck, and the cast includes Matt Wallace, Jaye Stellini, Annie Dilworth and Meredith Deighton.
Opens at 8 p.m. Friday and continues through Jan. 28, the Ringwald Theatre, Ferndale. 248-545-5545. theringwald.com. $20, $10 on Mondays.
Jazz club Cliff Bell's welcomes Detroit-born bassist and hometown booster RALPHE ARMSTRONG for a performance Saturday with the International Detroiters: Gayelynn McKinney (drums), Alex Colista (sax) and Gerard Gibbs (keyboards). Armstrong first made a splash as a teenager in the 1970s with John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra, and he later worked with Frank Zappa and Jean-Luc Ponty as well as Carlos Santana, Geri Allen and the London Symphony Orchestra. His most recent album, "Detroit Rising," features primarily Detroit musicians and pays homage to Detroit autoworkers and their contributions to the effort to win World War II. Its track "Gretchen's Groove" is dedicated to Carhartt heiress and jazz lover Gretchen Valade, who has devoted millions to keeping jazz alive in the Motor City.
9:30 p.m. Saturday, Cliff Bell's, Detroit. 313-961-2543. cliffbells.com. $10.
Talk about arcs, angles and triangles may dredge up scary memories of a high-school math class, but there's nothing frightening about "TEXTILE GEOMETRY: COMPOSITIONS BY KATIE McGRATH AND KATHRYN SCHMIDT," the exhibit opening Friday at the Northville Art House. Its organizers note that circles, squares and curves, along with the aforementioned arcs, angles and triangles, are the building blocks of textile artworks — a topic near and dear to McGrath and Schmidt. For many years, the two have been exhibiting and also teaching and writing about the use of textiles in art. Color and fabric texture are key to their work, along with stitch and embellishment. The exhibition continues through Jan. 26. There's an opening reception starting at 6 p.m. Friday.
Regular hours: noon-5 p.m. Tuesday-Friday, noon-4 p.m. Saturday, Northville Art House, Northville. 248-344-0497. northvillearthouse.org.
The film that won the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival arrives Friday at the Detroit Film Theatre for a two-weekend run. Palme d'Or recipient "SHOPLIFTERS" from celebrated Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda focuses on extreme poverty, a topic that's often invisible in modern Japan. Its story line involves members of Tokyo family who survive from day to day by a routine of petty thefts and occasional grifting. When they encounter a young girl whose family appears to have abused her, they take her in despite their poverty. The film won raves from U.S. critics, including the Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan, who wrote: " 'Shoplifters' well understands that family is the most intimate and problematic entity in all our lives. It calls on us to rethink its very nature ... unfolding a story that grows in complexity and intimacy almost without our knowing it."
7 p.m. Friday, 4 & 7 p.m. Saturday, 2 & 5 p.m. Sunday, DFT at the Detroit Institute of Arts. 313-833-4005. dia.org/dft. $9.50, $7.50 for seniors, students and DIA members. More screenings next weekend.
The Detroit group known casually known as the house band at Aretha's Jazz Café is kicking off 2019 with a new album. KINGDOM, made up of half a dozen Detroit-based touring musicians, will be celebrating the release of its disc "Prosperity" with performances Friday and Saturday at Jazz Café. The release party will also feature the debut of a new band video. Kingdom's uniquely Detroit sound incorporates funk and soul as well as jazz, pop and Motown. Members include Kern Brantley, Sundiata O.M., Rain Man, Derrick Benford, Nick Behenan and Desaun Jones. Brantley has performed with stars ranging from Aretha Franklin to Lady Gaga and Beyonce.
8 p.m. Friday-Saturday, Aretha's Jazz Café at Music Hall, Detroit. 313-887-8501. musichall.org. $10.
It launched in 2016, but the 20th anniversary tour of 1996 Broadway smash "RENT" is continuing into 2019 and arrives Tuesday at the Fisher for a nearly two-week-run The rock musical about a group of bohemian artist types struggling to survive in New York's East Village won four Tonys, including best musical, and developed a cult following among a segment of Gen Xers who responded emotionally to its life-affirming no-day-but-today message. The show addresses topics (AIDS, heroin, homelessness, gay relationships) that were still a bit edgy for a Broadway musical in the mid-'90s. Over the years, its signature tune, "Seasons of Love," has become a repertoire staple of college show choirs and community choral groups.
Opens at 8 p.m. Tuesday and continues through Jan. 20, Fisher Theatre, Detroit. 800-982-2787. broadwayindetroit.com. $39 and up.

The Romney Revival Project; Who's buying the latest repositioning from Utah's new senator?

Texto completo: Just before taking his seat as Utah's newest U.S. Senator, former presidential candidate and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is condemning the character of President Donald Trump. But given Mr. Romney's history, some members of the press corps are withholding the strange new respect customarily accorded to Republicans who criticize the President.
Mr. Romney states in an op-ed for the Washington Post that Mr. Trump "has not risen to the mantle of the office." Mr. Romney presents himself as being moved by recent events to make his latest declaration of principle. Writes Mr. Romney:
The Trump presidency made a deep descent in December. The departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, the appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president's thoughtless claim that America has long been a "sucker" in world affairs all defined his presidency down.
Certainly a duly-elected President has the right to choose his subordinates. And if Mr. Romney was truly moved to condemn an "abandonment of allies," wouldn't he at least go to the trouble of naming them and spending at least a portion of the op-ed describing the details of their predicament? From the context it seems likely he was referring to the Kurds or others fighting against remaining ISIS forces in Syria, but the rest of the op-ed addresses various threats around the world and what Mr. Romney sees as a fraying of alliances with friends in Europe and Asia.
It's also hard to believe that Mr. Romney is suddenly and deeply offended by Mr. Trump's recent comment that Americans are no longer "suckers." For better or worse, the idea that the U.S. government has been shouldering too much of the world's defense burden has been a central part of the Trump message for years. It's especially hard to believe that Utah's newest senator thinks this insult is beyond the pale given that in 2016 Mr. Romney said that candidate Donald Trump was "playing the members of the American public for suckers." Will Mr. Romney now apologize to the roughly 63 million Americans who voted for the Republican candidate in the last presidential election?
Aaron Blake of the Washington Post is among the media folk who aren't sure they should take the latest Romney declaration at face value. Mr. Blake writes in the Post:
Romney criticized Trump in more severe terms than just about anybody in 2016, even after Trump was the de facto GOP nominee. But he's also been happy to play ball and accept his help. As the GOP presidential nominee in 2012, he flew out to accept an endorsement from Trump, then in the throes of birtherism. After Trump was elected president, Romney interviewed to be Trump's secretary of state.
When Romney decided to run for Senate, he accepted Trump's endorsement again and backed off his previous criticisms of the leader. At a debate three months ago, Romney was asked three times whether he still thought Trump was a fraud and a phony. "I'm going to talk about the future," he responded.
His op-ed seems, in part, to be an effort to explain his many about-faces.
CNN's Chris Cillizza adds , "Romney's record of opposition to Trump is not entirely consistent, to put it nicely." Some media observers like Jonathan Chait of New York magazine see the new Romney message as clever positioning in case Republican voters someday decide they'd like a plan B for 2020.
This is hardly strange new respect, but perhaps a tip of the cynical cap. Such reactions may be disappointing to Mr. Romney. He might have hoped for a roar of approval from the nation's press corps, which could hardly be more open to those willing to launch rhetorical attacks on the President.
Howard Kurtz of Fox News reports :
A former executive editor of the New York Times says the paper's news pages, the home of its straight-news coverage, have become "unmistakably anti-Trump."
Jill Abramson, the veteran journalist who led the newspaper from 2011 to 2014, says the Times has a financial incentive to bash the president and that the imbalance is helping to erode its credibility.
This raises one of the great ironies of our age. Many of the same institutions claiming that Trump is destroying their liberties are thriving as never before as they freely criticize him. Mr. Kurtz notes:
Trump claims he is keeping the "failing" Times in business--an obvious exaggeration--but the former editor acknowledges a "Trump bump" that saw digital subscriptions during his first six months in office jump by 600,000, to more than 2 million.
No doubt many of those subscribers will enjoy reading about the Romney critique of Mr. Trump, even if they have doubts about the messenger.
As for Mr. Trump's supporters, they can take solace in polls suggesting that he has helped repair the political damage done by Mr. Romney to the GOP's effort to attract Latino voters.

Resumen: In an interview with the New York Times Magazine, former Senate leader Harry Reid called President Donald Trump "the worst president we’ve ever had."

Texto completo: In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times Magazine, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called President Donald Trump "without question the worst president we’ve ever had. "
"We’ve had some bad ones, and there’s not even a close second to him," the Nevada Democrat told the Times in an article that covered Reid's time as Senate majority leader, his relationship with his Democratic successor, Chuck Schumer, and his view on Trump's former Cabinet members.
Reid, who now lives in the suburbs of Las Vegas, the Times reported, also called Trump "an interesting person" but stopped short of calling him immoral.
"He is not immoral but is amoral. Amoral is when you shoot someone in the head, it doesn’t make a difference. No conscience," Reid told the Times. He also described Trump not as someone with a pessimistic worldview but rather, "a person who is oblivious to the real world. "

Reid served as majority leader from 2007 to 2015, during which he was instrumental in passing former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act.
In the interview, Reid also defended on his decision to do away with filibusters in judicial appointments – a move that, as the Times notes, cleared the way for Republicans and Trump to land two conservatives justices on the Supreme Court.
"They can say what they want," Reid told the newspaper. "We had over 100 judges that we couldn’t get approved, so I had no choice. Either Obama’s presidency would be a joke or Obama’s presidency would be one of fruition. "
Reid left the Senate after deciding not to seek re-election in the November 2016 elections. The decision came shortly after he was injured in an exercise accident. Then, in 2018, the Democrat had surgery to remove a tumor in his pancreas.

His former chief off staff, David Krone, told the Times he thought the decision to leave Washington saved Reid.
"He wouldn’t be alive today if he had pancreatic cancer and he was still the Senate leader," Krone said. "He would not have made it. "
Krone also said he thinks Reid misses his time as a legislator. Reid told the Times he still speaks with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi often.
"I love Nancy Pelosi. We did so many good things, and we still talk about that," Reid told the newspaper.
As for the Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, Reid was more reserved when speaking with the Times, saying they rarely speak.
"'My personal feeling should have nothing to do with it,' he said. But clearly Reid has more than a few of those personal feelings," Times reporter Mark Leibovich wrote. Leibovich reported that Reid has been critical of Schumer in private.
Reid also addressed others he worked with in the Senate, namely Jeff Sessions, the former Alabama senator and attorney general.
"Why in the hell didn’t Sessions leave?" he wondered, saying the same of former White House chief of staff John Kelly.
"I’d say, 'Go screw yourself. ' I could not look my children in the eye," Reid told the Times.

Texto completo: Cape Coral's Monkey Bar, despite what its name might suggest, is not monkeying around. Open since 2006, the steak and seafood restaurant offers classic American dishes with a touch of international flair.
And the restaurant's chef? He has a long and fabled history in Southwest Florida.
Nico Bogert, who owns the Monkey Bar with his partner, Claudia Garcia, once owned the popular Bogert's Chop House, which used to be on Winkler Road next to the Sonny's BBQ in south Fort Myers.
"Some people called us the Ruth's Chris of Fort Myers," Bogert said. "We were a really excellent steakhouse."
Bogert is originally from Amsterdam, where his parents owned an Italian restaurant. He attended culinary school when he was 14, began working in a restaurant when he was 16 and, after a stint in the military, spent time in Italy developing a love for the country's cuisine.
"Italian food is one of my passions," he said. "Throughout the years I've always thrown a little Italian stuff in there."
After Italy, Bogert returned to Amsterdam where he met his wife, an American woman traveling through Europe. The two married and spent the next three years living in Holland before they came to the United States. After launching his eponymous steakhouse in Fort Myers, Bogert became a local celebrity. He appeared on a regular Saturday morning show on NBC2 called "Cooking with Nico," and he was a frequent guest on the WINK morning show.
Bogert sold the 13,000-square-foot Bogert's in 2005 (he had a second location in Bonita that he sold to his business partner). The sale took place just before the real-estate crash that ruined many businesses in the area.
"I lucked out," Bogert said.
The Chop House's new owners changed the name, and it went out of business within the year.
As part of the deal, Bogert was not allowed to use his own name on another restaurant for five years. So, eight months later, when he decided to launch another eatery, that restaurant became the Monkey Bar. But with the burst in the Florida real-estate bubble and the downturn in the national economy, filling the restaurant became a challenge.
"It was a struggle getting customers in," he said. "A lot of people were thinking it was just bar food, and it took a while to get regular customers in here."
Over time, though, he built up a regular base. One of the reasons: his prices. Even though Bogert's previous restaurants had been fine dining, with the Monkey Bar he wanted to establish a more moderate price point.
"My goal was to bring some gourmet items and some interesting items that people may not be used to at a reasonable price," he said. "Our pricing is very reasonable, which is one of the reasons we're so successful."
The Monkey Bar is known for its pasta and Prime rib, as well as others cuts of beef such as filet mignon, New York strip, rib eye and cowboy steaks that Bogert cuts by hand in-house. One of his most famous dishes is a blackened grouper sandwich on sun-dried tomato focaccia bread with homemade balsamic glaze and sliced tomato. The 8-ounce Angus burger and chicken breast panini are also popular.
Today, Bogert is pleased with the Monkey Bar's ongoing popularity,
"We've been here 12 years, and it's very successful," he said. "A lot of snowbirds know us, and we're the first place they look up when they come back. That's all due to hard work and service and food."
And that, he would say, is no monkey business.

Warren says she'll make stops in Iowa this weekend

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren, who announced on Monday that she was forming a committee to explore the possibility of running for president in 2020, said Tuesday she plans campaign stops this weekend in Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses in 13 months.
The senator, who has not traveled to Iowa recently, is slated to visit several of the state's major cities: Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Storm Lake, and Sioux City, according to The New York Times.
In announcing the formation of the committee, Warren, 69, released a video that cast her as an agent of transformation for Americans who have felt left behind. The former Harvard law professor contends a small class of billionaires and corporate interests have hijacked the gears of government in Washington.
“Our government's supposed to work for all of us, but instead it has become a tool for the wealthy and well-connected," said Warren, who later pronounced from a news conference at her Cambridge home: “I'm in this fight all the way."

Top Defense spokeswoman resigns abruptly after MattisThe Defense Department's top spokeswoman, who had been under investigation since May over whether she mistreated employees, abruptly resigned Monday night within hours of the departure of Jim Mattis, the defense secretary.
Dana W. White said on Twitter: "I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by this administration to serve alongside Secretary Mattis, our service members, and all the civilians who support them. It has been my honor and privilege. Stay safe and God bless."
A Defense Department spokesperson on Tuesday confirmed White had resigned. Charles E. Summers Jr. replaced White, becoming "acting" assistant to the defense secretary, according to the Pentagon. Summers had served as secretary of state in Maine.
Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and the No. 2 man at the Pentagon, became acting secretary Monday night, replacing Mattis.

A Different Cup of Tea

Texto completo: Americans who weren't born into Korean cuisine have discovered it in many ways and many locales over the past decade or two. Bulgogi folded into tortillas has been handed out through the window of a roving truck. Smoked kimchi has been draped over pulled pork between halves of a cheese-glazed doughnut to make an outdoor food-stall sandwich called the Chonut. Hwe, raw fish eaten with condiments that typically spread across an entire table, has been streamlined to one or two bites in a tasting menu administered by servers in sci-fi tunics. The pork belly dish bo ssam has been reimagined as a whole roasted pork shoulder that a gang of hungry people could use in a bonding ritual involving heads of lettuce, a platter of oysters and a pair of tongs.
More often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants' kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix's U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary.
Hwaban, which opened in Chelsea in August, is something different. It's the modern Korean restaurant where you'd take your mother.
The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur.
Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de thé, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes -- made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears -- that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children.
And while some restaurants are saving money by doing without pastry chefs, Hwaban needs two of them to keep up with its obsession with Western-style sweets. One, Ahram Song, is a buttercream specialist who tints and shapes frosting into botanically detailed flower arrangements decorating chocolate or honey-pecan cakes. Another, Lauren Kim, makes the fleecy cheesecake that is carved into slivers the length of a dinner plate; pretty, well-tailored French numbers like a passion-fruit Pavlova or a drum of white cake filled with fresh strawberries and frosted with whipped cream; and the cookies and toffees that are sold by the box, for takeout.
The illusion that you've wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking.
"This is my mother's recipe," Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables.
She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms -- the menu calls it a dumpling -- sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls "snowy bibimbap," a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone.
The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban's most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets.
Like the Manhattan restaurants Atomix and Jungsik, Hwaban de-emphasizes the sweeter and spicier side of the Korean palate so other flavors can come through. Coins of poached pollock roe are sliced over a block of soft tofu in a clear, subtle dried-seafood broth. Soy-braised abalone is served in an anchovy broth that is, if not exactly subtle, at least soft-spoken.
One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi.
There is, of course, a sharp little kick to the spicy fish stew known as maeun-tang, and a fair amount of chile paste in the daktori-tang, a spin on the classic braised chicken and vegetable dish, both of which Mr. Jang makes very well. But there is also the surprise of tasting ginger and carrots along with the chiles in a bright orange sauce for seared salmon.
Ms. Han and Mr. Kim also own Kosaka, a chiaroscuro lair for omakase sushi on West 13th Street. I was a little put off by how active the servers were there; just as I was focusing on the piece of fish in front of me, somebody would dart in at one elbow or the other to ask how I was enjoying it all.
The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother's.
Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short à la carte menu. They're served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that's topped with browned mozzarella -- in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.

Texto completo: Dasha Fincher said she was borrowing a friend's car when she noticed a half-eaten bag of blue cotton candy in the floorboard. It was the kind kids like to buy from gas stations near her Macon home. She thought little of it until a few minutes later when it became the biggest problem in her life.
On New Year's Eve 2016, Monroe County deputies pulled the car over for a suspected window-tint violation and spotted the bag. They used a quick roadside test kit on the blue stuff and got a positive result for methamphetamine. Fincher ended up charged with trafficking meth and held in jail for three months on a breathtaking $1 million cash bond before a lab test found the "meth" was really just cotton candy, according to a lawsuit.
Fincher, 41, filed a lawsuit last month against Monroe County commissioners, the deputies and the manufacturer of the roadside test kits. Her suit, which asks for a jury to determine how much she is owed, says the county should have known that the kits can give incorrect results.
The manufacturer's instructions warn that test results should be confirmed by a lab.
"They are not a scientific-level test," said veteran drug cop Phil Price, who is head of the Cherokee County Multi-Agency Narcotics Squad. "Our policy is we would not use that as the sole evidence for an arrest."
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which does lab tests for police around the state, couldn't provide statistics on exactly how often the tests, the Nark II roadside analysis kits, malfunction. Even the manufacturer, Sirchie Acquisition Co. of Youngsville, N.C., couldn't give an accuracy rate.
Many factors, including cold temperatures and officer training, can contribute to incorrect results, according to an expansive 2016 ProPublica-New York Times report. The investigation found the roadside tests, combined with poor training, had contributed to 15 false accusations of drug possession in a span of seven months in Hillsborough County, Fla.
When a kit fails, people can end up jailed until they post bond or a lab test contradicts the kit's results. In some cases, ProPublica and the Times reported, people simply plead guilty to end the ordeal.
Test maker Sirchie and the Monroe County attorney, Ben Vaughn, didn't respond to requests for comment on Fincher's suit, filed in Middle Georgia U.S. District Court. John Cary Bittick, who left his post as Monroe sheriff this year to accept an appointment by President Donald Trump as Middle Georgia's U.S. Marshal, declined to comment. Current Monroe
Sheriff Brad Freeman said he couldn't speak on pending litigation, but he did signal plans to investigate the kits, which are still being used by Monroe deputies.
"Anytime a product or something like that fails," Freeman said, "you certainly need to look into it."
But the case also raises other questions: Why was Fincher, who struggles financially, given a $1 million bond? Why was she indicted before the GBI's lab results were returned? Why did it take almost three months for the lab results to exonerate her? Why did it then take an additional 13 days for her to get out of jail?
"What happened in this case was a complete failure of the system in every regard," said Stephen Bright, a Georgia State University professor who spent nearly 25 years as director of Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta. "To take three months of anyone's liberty is an extraordinary thing."
'Are you kidding me?'
Monroe Deputies Cody Maples and Kevin Williams pulled over the old gray Toyota Corolla on Ga. 19 near Forsyth around 3 p.m. Dec. 31, 2016. Maples initially thought the window tint was too dark, he wrote in a report.
Then deputies discovered Fincher's boyfriend, David Morris Jr., who isn't involved in the suit, was driving with a suspended license. They asked the couple to consent to a search, which Fincher and Morris did. Dashcam video provided to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution by Fincher's lawyer James Freeman shows one deputy pull a bag from the floorboard that was transparent with a crusty blue mass inside.
Fincher told the lawmen it was cotton candy. Both deputies opened the bag and sniffed.
The deputies brought out the Nark II roadside test kit, the suit says. To use the kit, officers drop a suspected drug into a clear liquid, and if the liquid turns purple, it's a positive result for meth. If it turns red, it's negative.
Inthiscase, itturnedpurple.
Fincher grew concerned. "Are you kidding me?" she recalls saying.
The options
There on the roadside, things could've gone differently. Because the tests are known to fail, the deputies could've confiscated the suspected drugs, let the couple go and arrested them later if a lab test confirmed the reading, said Marietta attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who isn't involved in the case. Or, she added, the suspects could have been given a lower bond they could pay.
Price, the Cherokee County narcotics squad commander, said the tests are best used as an indicator, not evidence.
But Monroe deputies relied on the findings of the roadside test and clicked on the cuffs.
Fincher and her boyfriend had both been convicted of drug charges more than a decade ago, which lawyers said the deputies could have seen when they ran their names, though it's not clear if they did. For Morris, it was possession of meth and a subsequent escape. For Fincher, it was having marijuana growing in her bedroom. She pleaded guilty under the First Offender Act, did two years on probation and the charge is no longer on her record, according to the Jones County Clerk of Superior Court's Office.
Tommy Wilson, the chief Superior Court judge for the Towaliga Judicial Circuit, gave both suspects a $1 million cash bond, meaning they'd have to put up the full amount to get out. The judge didn't respond to a request for comment.
Fincher's bond, which was far higher than some murder suspects get in Georgia, was plainly "excessive," said Bright.
Another
curious arrest
While Fincher was in jail, the mother of three longed for her family and missed several milestones, including the birth of twin grandsons and her daughter's miscarriage. Fincher kept calling her 18-month-old granddaughter, fearful little Aniyah would forget her.
Fincher said she woke up every morning thinking today would be the day everyone realized they'd made a grave error. But it kept getting worse.
She'd been looking forward to witnessing the birth of her twin grandsons. Instead, her son had to bring the babies to the jail to introduce her. It could've been a nice enough moment.But within seconds, her son was also arrested, told he had a bench warrant, according to the lawsuit.
Fincher was so frustrated she punched a wall, breaking her hand. She said she was seen by a doctor, who recommended a full cast and physical therapy. Her lawsuit alleges she never received treatment for her hand.
The next day, Fincher's son, who isn't involved in her lawsuit, was released and told his arrest had been a mistake, the suit says.
When Fincher's daughter had a miscarriage, the mother hurt for not being there to comfort her.
"I lost a lot that I can never get back," Fincher said.
Haunted
On March 15, a grand jury
indicted Fincher for trafficking meth, though the GBI hadn't returned lab results.
Delays at the GBI's labs have been well-known in recent years, as the already-busy agency has taken on more work, such as tests resulting from the opioid epidemic, a huge backlog of unexamined rape kits and more police shooting investigations.
On March 22, the GBI issued its report, saying the bag taken from Fincher's car contained no controlled substances.
But that was not the morning when she woke up and realized it was all over. Nor was the next day, or the next. It was 13 days before she was released from jail, still facing the same charges. She left simply by signing her name without posting the $1 million bond. The reason for her delayed release is unknown.Monroe's interim DA Elizabeth Bobbitt didn't respond to an email for comment.
On April 18, Fincher appeared for her arraignment, and the charges were dismissed.
Since her release, she's relished being back with family. But she said the ordeal still haunts her life. The charge shows up on background checks, the suit says. She lives with trauma. When she sees a cop behind her, she gets nervous.
Her first thought is to check the floorboard.

What are 'Vox Lux,' 'A Star Is Born' trying to say about pop?

Texto completo: The power ballad that anchors "Vox Lux" might stick with you for some time - if not for its almost mechanical catchiness, then for the circumstances surrounding its creation. In real life, "Wrapped Up" was co-written by Sia, the Australian multi- hyphenate known for her pop earworms. In the movie, it's co-written by Celeste (Raffey Cassidy), a Staten Island eighth-grader who narrowly survives a school shooting in 1999.
Celeste and her older sister perform "Wrapped Up" in front of their community as a means to heal. But after a record label takes notice and encourages Celeste to change a lyric from "I" to "we," the song leaps from the memorial service to the radio waves. Suddenly, her trauma belongs to the world.
"A lot of the songs that are early on in this movie . . . they weren't designed for the masses. They just came from the heart," director Brady Corbet told The Washington Post. "As the film progresses, the songs sort of change. The lyrics, at least in the context of the film, speak to generalities and platitudes that are a little bit like an audience having their tarot read."
That could apply to many forms of mainstream art, but "Vox Lux" posits that it is especially true of pop music. Corbet's film highlights the sincere but fixates on what he calls the "rather disturbing aspects" of pop stardom, both of which 31-year-old Celeste (a melodramatic Natalie Portman) captures when she explains the reasoning behind her shallow lyrics: "I don't want people to think too hard," she says about halfway through the film. "I just want them to feel good."
But are those experiences mutually exclusive? What is "Vox Lux," a movie sympathetic to its troubled artist, trying to say about pop music?
If the questions sound familiar, that's because similar ones came up a few months ago with "A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper's movie featuring enamored protagonists who famously sing about being "far from the shallow now." (Jude Law, who plays Celeste's manager, once referred to "Vox Lux" as the other film's "wicked sister.") As country rocker Jackson Maine (Cooper) struggles with addiction and witnesses his career fall apart, aspiring songwriter-turned-pop star Ally (Lady Gaga) goes from writing songs Jackson considers meaningful to performing a catchy song with lyrics that praise his, ahem, assets on "Saturday Night Live."
Jackson doesn't take the compliment well and instead laments the direction Ally's career has taken - basically, the selling-out story line that we've seen many times before. But this conversation is layered. The songwriters, including Diane Warren, didn't intend for "Why Did You Do That?" to be considered a bad song. And while Gaga told Variety the song is "relatively shallow," Cooper said he didn't "necessarily view [Ally's] music as superficial. I think she's performing with all her heart."
The song signifies Ally selling out, yes, but is that from Jackson's point of view or the filmmaker's? Are we, as audience members, supposed to side with him? Or is he, as some have cleverly mused online, an "unreliable narrator whose world view the film critiques throughout"?
When asked whether he thinks his film and "A Star Is Born" portray pop music in a negative light, Corbet laughed at the implied notion that, as he put it, "something which is very popular is under attack."
"The idea that anybody needs to come to the defense of one of the most lucrative industries in America is totally ridiculous," he continued.
The songs in "Vox Lux" aren't supposed to be bad , per se. Corbet recruited Sia to co-write the music and described the results as "affected and intoxicating," which is especially true of "Wrapped Up." Songs such as "Private Girl," in which Celeste declares that she is "a private girl in a public world," and "Firecracker," in which she claims to have "a sixth sense on where the party is headed," are a bit more grating.
"Natalie's character serves as an avatar to talk about the . . . patterns that mark our contemporary values in this country," Corbet explained. "It's not about pop music, it's about pop culture. The pop songs are avatars to describe the pros and cons of pop culture."
So it isn't necessarily Celeste's music at which "Vox Lux" takes aim, but the detriments of the culture surrounding it. Her tragedy is "exploited by the pop music industry," according to Corbet, and she is encouraged to produce music that often speaks more to generic experiences than her own. Without a proper emotional outlet, and haunted by childhood trauma, she acts out. She uses drugs. She yells at her manager. She yells at her sister. She yells at complete strangers.
Celeste ends up a cog in a machine, but at the same time, she sort of is the machine. The first half of the film is about how the culture shaped her, Corbet said, and the second is about how she, in turn, shapes the culture. Celeste not only sings but also speaks to her fans in those "generalities and platitudes." During the concert sequence that closes out the film, she asks her audience: Have you ever had a boy break your heart? Has anyone ever called you ugly? Has anyone ever called you fat? If so, this one's for you.
"There's something so pathetic about this moment and yet, of course, what she's saying is so commonplace - it's totally ordinary, but it's delivered as if it's vital and important and unique," Corbet said. "There's something about that I find really interesting, the idea of exploiting the insecurities that, of course, people have."
But pop stars no longer shape culture with generic messages - at least, not to the same extent. While Taylor Swift sells out stadiums and speaks to the masses about issues they all face, such as online bullying, she has also started to speak out on topics that in another era could have ended her career, including politics. Ariana Grande's "Thank U, Next" preaches self-acceptance in a way that few breakup songs have. On top of it all, a recent Vanity Fair piece argues that the definition of "pop star" has been so in flux throughout 2018 that traditional pop stars like Ally and Celeste are "no longer the de-facto agenda-setters" for mass audiences. The New York Times adds that the power has been transferred to pop subgenres: "K-pop, Latin trap, melodic hip-hop and more."
Perhaps "Vox Lux" presents an image of pop stardom that will soon feel dated. Regardless, unlike Celeste's lyrics, it makes you think - and that's all Corbet wants.
"I really appreciate the debate that ensues when the film is finished," he said. "I think that it's important, and it's welcome. The film was designed to stir these kinds of conversations."

Democrats who used Russian tactics in Alabama must stop

Texto completo: The victims of social media manipulation have become the attackers. A New York Times article detailing how a group of Democrats borrowed Russian tactics in last year's Senate race in Alabama is an ominous development in a dawning age of information warfare.

The Times reports that the operators of a secret experiment to undermine Republican candidate Roy Moore created a Facebook page to support a write-in conservative. They also, according to an internal report, "orchestrated an elaborate 'false flag' operation" to link Moore's campaign to "a Russian botnet." News organizations picked up on the influx of accounts and reported the supposed foreign interference.

The effort was small, costing its organizers $100,000 in a $51 million election. But that does not make it any less worrying. Domestic actors on both sides of the aisle, it seems, are willing to turn the tricks against their opponents that Russia has used against the United States. Each time one party promotes a false narrative or unleashes a horde of internet trolls, the other has more incentive to employ those same techniques -- setting off a cycle of discord and doubt in our democracy. The United States has no system in place to stop the spiral.

The country stands at a critical juncture: Either society wards off the spread of these strategies or they become the new normal. One answer is self-restraint. Billionaire Reid Hoffman, who says he unknowingly funded the Alabama project, was right to apologize this week. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., is also right to demand an investigation. But candidates, political committees, big nongovernmental organizations and others should also pledge not to engage in inauthentic activity, just as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee promised not to promote hacked material in the 2018 midterms.

It may be unrealistic to expect the president and Republican allies to commit to such an agreement, given their record on confronting Russian subversion. But the upcoming presidential primary will offer Democrats a test; already, intraparty feuds are spreading on online networks. As they announce their campaigns, contenders should promise not to do to their rivals what Russia did to them in 2016.

Structural changes will help, too. Bipartisan appetite in the Senate for protective measures was curbed this year by a recalcitrant House. With Democrats in charge, things could change. Congress should start by authorizing more information -- sharing between the Department of Homeland Security and federal party committees and campaigns to catch manipulators in the act, no matter where they come from. Members of Moore's and Jones' staffs, for example, noticed something was off.

The Russians' goal in 2016 may have been to get Donald Trump elected, but it was also to convince Americans that the democracy we had spent our lives believing in could not be trusted after all. Now it is up to us to prove them wrong.

Texto completo: Retiring Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan said the biggest challenge his replacement will face is rapid advances in technology that are making agents' jobs more difficult.
Keenan, who worked with the bureau for nearly 40 years, announced his retirement in December and worked his last day in office Monday. He has been the GBI's director since 2003 and will be replaced on an interim basis by Deputy Director Scott Dutton. Keenan's permanent replacement hasn't been announced by Gov.-elect Brian Kemp.
In recent years, Keenan said he's been frustrated by shifts in technology, especially encryption, which restricts access to suspects' cellphones and computers, locking out investigators. The issue will require constant attention to the tech market and regular upgrades in the technology available to agents, Keenan said.
"Much of the crime we're dealing with now, there is a nexus with technology," Keenan told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Friday. "It's all types of crime. It goes from homicide to drug cases to fraud. The encryption keeps being stronger and stronger."
In Keenan's view, law enforcement hasn't received much cooperation from technology companies. He isn't alone in that view. The FBI was frustrated in 2016 by Apple's decision to fight a court order to unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in a terror attack that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.
The FBI ended up findinga way to crack the phone without Apple's help by using a third party to exploit a hole in the operating system's security. Soon, police across the country began using that method too, according to The New York Times. Apple announced in June it was closing that technological loophole, partly because of fear that criminals could also exploit it.
When a smartphone is locked, the data inside is encrypted until the pass code is typed in. Users can also download apps to enhance encryption, which privacy advocates argue has legitimate purposes for the security of law-abiding citizens, even if it complicates things for police: They may have a warrant for information stored in a device they can't unlock.
Often GBI agents are frustrated in their attempts to gather evidence from locked devices, Keenan said, likening it to knowing there's a dead body in a building but not being able to open the door. The agency has been upgrading technology in recent years but still finds cases where it is locked out.
Another challenge awaiting Keenan's replacement is a growing number of requests for help from local law agencies, Keenan said. He sees the increase as a result of a shortage of officers and experienced investigators in those smaller agencies. For example, the GBI has been getting calls for help working assault cases; in the past, it would take more serious cases, such as homicides, for a small department to ask for assistance.
If those requests for help grow, it could put even more pressure on GBI agents, who have already taken on new responsibilities in recent years.Investigating
officer-involved shootings for some of the largest departments in the state has become a priority for the GBI as those cases have drawn increasing public scrutiny.
The director who will face these challenges might not be known for weeks. Gov. Nathan Deal appointed Dutton as the interim head, but the selection of a permanent leader is up to Kemp, who will be sworn in on Jan. 14. Keenan, who had been mulling retirement for years so he could spend more time with his already-retired wife, said he hasn't heard who will be named to replace him. When he told Kemp he was leaving, Kemp didn't ask for a recommendation, and Keenan didn't offer one.
Whoever it turns out to be will enjoy the groundwork laid by Keenan, according to Georgia law enforcement veterans.
"There is literally no area in our profession (that) Mr. Keenan has not touched and helped to improve," said Frank Rotondo, executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police. Rotondo includes technology in the areas Keenan helped the agency grow, as well as officer-involved shooting investigations, DNA testing, crime scene processing and database creation.
Still, Keenan said there is much work to be done when his replacement takes over.
"The crime environment," he said, "is in constant flux."
